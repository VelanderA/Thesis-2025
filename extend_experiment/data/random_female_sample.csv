"""At the end, Trump closed with a Bible passage which he improbably implied he was already familiar with (while also oddly suggesting that his typical campaign audiences aren’t as familiar with the Bible).""

""I’d like to conclude with a passage from 1 John, Chapter 4. You know it? 

""Trump even came away with a few gifts, as he was eventually draped in a Jewish prayer shawl, which Bishop Jackson told Trump would help him through the adversities of his campaign, and he also gave Trump a pair of Bibles for him and his wife to study. “I feel better already,” Trump responded.""

CON MAN!!!"
"It's actually kind of interesting to watch a icon commit suicide, especially when it is completely irrational and based on nothing but lies!  That is what we are enmeshed in at the moment with the NFL and their totally false precept of ""social injustice"" and Cops killing blacks.  Every last bit of it is based on hot air and not an iota of factual information.  What makes it more interesting is that the simpletons accepting and spreading the lies are some of the most highly paid in the country.  Well you know what I say - I say anyone that dumb and that much of a liar shouldn't be making that kind of money, so let's see to it that they don't!  Boycott their games in person and on TV!"
“Black Lives No Maddah” That’s how it looks when people of color always making the news with killings and over crowded prisons.
"Nope, but you have no examples of me being racist. Absolutely none. Unless, of course, you choose to redefine racism to support an agenda of some sorts. 

It's hard to talk to kids about things like skin color and societal expectations. Many black kids are taught through the soft racism of lower expectations that they need help to make things better.  It's even harder when they hear that dad is a racist or that anyone who doesn't vote a certain way is a racist, or heartless or whatever. Teaching kids to think beyond skin color is a daily task when people like you throw labels around so casually. 

I used to post under my real name but gave that up because of this right here. I feel that being anonymous is lame and allows such behavior but I didn't want my family to suffer for my ideas shared here."
"Eight years ago Obama won, people in their 50's, 60's proudly stated they voted for the first time, they voted in an historical election, voted in the first black President.  Is this going to be true in this election?  only its the first Woman.  Qualifications mean nothing, Clinton is playing up this, the press written and spoken playing it up.  The qualifications of the previous President, first, black, has not been good, so forget being the First when you vote.  The women in our military, those serving on our ships, met the qualifications ( the same men must go through), those women who wish to serve on the front lines, the special forces, met the qualifications that men must meet.  It is not about being a Woman, a Black, what ever, it is about being Qualified. If you vote, reason being The First, please don't brag about it, you have shown disrespect to those running and the purpose of voting.  Hang a sign around your neck, I voted for the first woman President, issues what issues?"
"All of the high profiled black men and teenagers that were murdered in the past three years, Davis.  I have no intention of persuading you one way or another.  I see and listen to the local, state, and national news and formal investigations.   What about the shooting of five Dallas police officers; early reporting coming out of Dallas indicated that 2-4 snipers were involved.  As of early afternoon today, now Dallas is  reporting only one shooter was involved and not 2-4.  Media outlets trample each other to get the first stories out, triggering misinformation.  It's amazing what anyone can see and hear when bigotry and racism isn't involved."
"A very interesting article, and well written. I wish you had paid more attention to the educational efforts of Catholic orders, like the De la Sallians. They left behind a legacy of high educational standards for black people. I am told that even  today the relatively good education standards in Zimbabwe owe much to Catholic schools. It is rather a paradox that education, the best weapon against inequality and racism, came to Africa via the colonial collaboration of Christianity (not only that of the Catholic church)."
"Why are you surprised that the response to murderous authoritarianism is violence? The Democrats are very law and order, much as it doesn't fit your narrative - they're within the current system of authority and power and want to perpetuate their place in it. If you want less violence on the streets the best method would be for the police to stop shooting black people - vigilante cops make for good action movies and bad cities."
"it is absolutely disrespectful to the flag and what it stands for to kneel during the anthem. The protesting athletes might want to open a history book at take a look at the flag that flew over the Union soldiers during the Civil war, and the flag that liberated the world from tyranny in WW1 and WW2; because if Hitler had won, there would be no blacks left on this planet, or Jews or Gypsies, or gays. America isn't perfect, but it is a hell of a lot better than most places in the world today for freedom of expression, freedom to live, love and worship as you want. 

Now, if you athletes want to make a difference, protest the violence and poverty in the inner cities, protest the destruction of the Black family, protest the culture that demeans learning and hard work to get ahead in the world. Protest the culture of 'victimhood'."
"Not what my Sheikh says.  And he's black himself.  That whole ""black Americans cannot be racist"" slogan has been pretty much discredited."
"Would you like to go over the flag code and speak about the various ways it is disrespected by the NFL itself (displaying the flag horizontally), many fans (wearing apparel with the flag on it), and our President (selling apparel with the flag on it and using it as advertisements), or are you only concerned about (mostly) black athletes not meeting a 'status quo' of what you believe patriotism should require?

Shall we also go over the First Amendment and point out that forced patriotism is among the last things the Founders of this country would find to be within American values?"
"""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,"" she said, ""if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."" Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America, by Linda Gordon

In an interview with Mike Wallace in 1957, Sanger said, “I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world, that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically.”

“Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they’re born. That to me is the greatest sin—that people can—can commit,” she said.  

On blacks, immigrants and indigents:
""...human weeds,' 'reckless breeders,' 'spawning... human beings who never should have been born.""  Margaret Sanger, Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people.

The purpose in promoting birth control was ""to create a race of thoroughbreds,"" she wrote in the Birth Control Review, Nov. 1921 (p. 2)"
Zuma is 7 years too late wt his radical economic transformation. we and i mean black south africans are not stupid. we are connectin the dots. the ignorant ANC leadership should be well to note that it is the middle classes that pay the bulk of taxesand it isus who cause revolutionsglthat caused uprisings.
"Caused and effect has been replicated in a longitudinal study. 

The study variables the were controled doesnt have to be exactly the same: two black parents and one at home, and from the same neighborhood and age, poverty, similar results with perhaps different metrics of success. 

For example the original study measured recent monthly income instead of annual income. Since many of these families would have difficulty with annual income records, this was the most accurate method. Sampling more than once a year yielded a statistically significant result since the differences between the groups were so large.

Another thing is unforeseen events which affected many in both groups iirc like a plant closure."
"Although the food was pretty good, I had a strange experience at NLB.  As a vegetarian who dislikes mushrooms, I always ask restaurant staff whether their veggie burgers are made with mushrooms.  The order taker looked like I was crazy.  She then asked the kitchen staff.  The best they could answer is ""You can probably assume that the black bean burger probably doesn't have mushrooms.""  For a place that says it is vegan, you would think it would be able to list what the ingredients are."
"Sure won't be many locations named for democrats after they get done sanitizing their history!Nor statues to them either!George Orwell was a very forward seeing genius.Most of what I've heard and seen about the statues, and even the ideologies is based on ignorance.The pubiK skoul sistum has done an excellent job under liberal control!Most lefties don't know the 1st black slave in the Americas was awarded by an English Court to a black man. Or that upwards of 90000 free blacks fought for the confederacy. Or that 5 states remained IN the union AND remained slave states (the IRS taxing slave sales starting in 1862 to pay for the war).Or slavery was still legal in DC. during the Civil War.  Or that the emancipation proclamation didn't free ANY of those slaves.  Or, that the ""civil war"" was fought to preserve the union, NOT free the slaves.  And the 1860 platform was not to EXTEND slavery....it wasn't specifically ""anti-slavery"". Libs don't know history, and are repeating it."
"You guys are hilarious in your flaccid attempts to turn reality on its head. Virtually everyone can see through the same old garbage you guys try to fling out there and hope it sticks...


Two questions: 

1. What happened during and since the 60s to the two parties?
2. Why does TODAY'S Democratic Party get most of the black vote?"
"T-bone, almost everything you post is bleeding heart liberal so I'm not sure why you are scolding me about feeling.  As far as concealed/carry goes, it's good to see that someone has some sense in Chicago.  But that has nothing to do with the liberal policies that enhance the possibility for gang violence and black on black crime."
"When Trump won over your slave owner Clinton, you know full well that if you attack Trump you would find yourselves getting investigated, but you were sure you could get away with it because you use the race card, but that is failing too. Democrats can't even cheat and win an election. You sorry POS all Liberals and Democrats will be in jail soon, how will you stay in Politics then cheater? If Civil war come out of this for you cheating Democrats hiring thugs as actors in riots we will come for you asswipes first before we fight each other. How long do you think it will take for the black people find out your supporting slavery by protecting the Slave Masters the Democrats for your own gain?  I will make this Viral as fast as I can. Democrats refused to vote to abolish Slavery, and you are with them because to think the low income blacks are desperate enough to get paid to riot and convince the rest that Democrats will take care of them. Obama proved this fact, what did he do?"
"Then do something about the deleteriousness of drugs and alcohol. Encourage lawmakers to provide more funding for treatment. But don't lie about cannabis. When you tell kids how terrible it is when the evidence of their eyes tells them that's false, it says to them you lied about other drugs. If you keep it out of the black market, kids won't come in contact with dealers who may not have any weed that day but has this stuff called ""smack."""
"""and Goebbels Cheney""

You don't get it.  The Cheney ship sailed away with Hillary.  She was the neoconservative interventionist.  She wanted a no-fly zone in Syria and war with Russia.  That's not happening anymore because Trump won.  He wrecked those plans.  He upset the established order of permanent war in the Middle East.  He decided to ally with Russia against the terrorists.  

I know, I know, ""our allies.""  Poor Saudi Arabia cannot accomplish their goals.  Their $20 million donation to the Clinton Foundation was based upon their honest, genuine, heartfelt support for women's rights and gay rights in Africa.  I'm sure.  

I'm sorry that the ""evil dictator"" is still in power in Syria.  If only we could have ""spread democracy"" there like we did in Iraq and Libya.  Those were such glorious and righteous causes!  If only we could have let the radical Islamic jihadists take over Syria too, then everything would be so much better like it is in Mosul or Benghazi!"
"wow.  religious racism.  rare but not unheard of.  If he were a person of color, would you tell people of his race to fix it?  People have been distorting religion for centuries to benefit themselves and turn people away from the primary message, in the case of Christianity, is Love.  Clearly Grisham is willing to do and say the most outrageous things to get attention - thus his selfies, his radio show, etc.  The gates of heaven may not be so welcoming for him..."
"""this area of growing violence against Republican....""   Seriously Paul? Got some stats.  While your at it look up growing violence against journalist and young black men by cops.  

This guy had mental illness.  It was not a Republican thing.  This guy like all shooters was just plain ill.  Here's a guy with multiple incident of violence in his history yet he can buy a gun just like you and me. That sir, is the fault of Republicans. We seem to wait til they have felony conviction before we take their gun away, when in reality misdeamenors such as assualt should also be scrutitinized.  This guy assaulted someone with the butt of a gun, yet those charges were dropped.  

Anyone can tell that Mcaulliff, including him, made a nerd error about 93 million and he recanted. Not unusual. He corrected himself and you did not mention that,  

Any one who is held convicted of a domestic assault, felony or not, looses their guns. Why wait til they are a felon, and more so with his guys history"
"So, the birther movement was not a personal attack?  He has been accused of being a ""secret Muslim"" and born in Kenya, of being complicit with the Muslim Brotherhood, of wearing a ring bearing a secret verse from the Quran, of having once been a Black Panther, of refusing to recite the Pledge of Allegiance, of seeking to confiscate all guns, of lying about just about everything he has ever said, ranging from Benghazi to the Affordable Care Act to immigration, of faking Osama bin Laden's death and of funding his campaigns with drug money. Those were not personal attacks?
I think it's time to wake up!"
"HUH?  Seems you too have forgotten Kraperkrap?  Hates his country, hates the police. Supports BLM. And you have the nerve to say Trump started it?  Get a life."
"Imagine if you well, please it is not hard if you try. Say the folks walking down the street the wrong way were trump supporters and a black man was in the suv, are you seeing this in your mind, try to open it up, and the events unfolded exactly the same way. How many of you here that put the blame on Sparhawk, at least some if not all, would feel the same about it being a black man, or in fact about anyone who had a HRC flag on their vehicle? Be honest with yourselves, there are those here who would completely change their stance and blame just the Trump supporters. These same people will refuse to acknowledge the hypocrisy of there positions. Are you listening icon, how about you eric? Dejain, becca you here? Can you  disagree with what I just wrote?"
"The last five elections have been about oil, and very little else.  The issue is whether the oil companies can maintain the gridlock that has prevented anything being done about climate change.  Up to now, the combination of oil money and a cynical exploitation of the opposition of evangelical Christians to abortion, of gun nuts, and of increasingly strident racism, has allowed the oil companies to achieve their objective.

But their ability to play that game is facing a demographic tsunami.

They refused to reform themselves after the Romney defeat.

Instead, they doubled down on a strategy that requires them to whip an ever shrinking and narrowing demographic base into a frenzy.

And then the oil companies were beaten at their own game by an even bigger flim-flam artist.

A guy who has done everything he can to be as offensive as possible to Spanish-speakers, women, and African-Americans.

The Republican candidate has himself hastened the demographic day of reckoning ..."
"I thought you guys said we cant call people of color ""thugs"" because its racist!"
"It is not Shakespeare or no Shakespeare scenario in Ontario. What it is happening is rather than students maybe reading 4 Shakespeare plays over their high school career, they will now read 2 plays and then read other material.

In the senior grades, English students are often given the choice of reading 1 of 10 or 12 books available in the department.  This could include other iconic writers such as Dickens or Harper Lee or it may include more recently acclaimed writers who represent diversity.   I am aware of schools in less diverse parts of the province than Peel that are reading The Book of Negroes or Three Day Road or No Great Mischief etc.  

These are all good books that will still allow students to learn the main principles of reading and writing and thinking about issues in the world.

It is Shakespeare plus many other writers that provide students some choice on what they read."
"Good for ADN.  Perhaps they'll make people like you, Black, Obooba, Craig, and Chance disappear for good."
"Black African Americans complaining is unjustified. There is no discrimination, only dealing with troublesome passengers of all denominations."
"Actually you did make me look, and I hadn't made any mistake as you'd claimed. That was a fairly ignorant thing to do, I believe, on the order of some wall scrawl by a graffiti artist. Surely you can find more useful things to do."
So what your data is saying is that minorities commit a disproportionate amount of crime. 22% of murder suspects were black while they represent only 5.9% of the population. You're being intellectually dishonest in an effort to appear not racist.
We have never had a black president.
"Wow - have you ever even been to the Waldorf school?  I have three children there, and there has been no discussion about not letting children read books (my 8 y/o could read at a higher level than most 5th graders when he was 6) and nothing about black crayons (your example of the blackboard is inane - how could you draw in black on a chalkboard?) and nothing even close to Aryan ideals - in fact, I am Jewish, and the school has been incredibly open to us and incorporates many non-Christian teachings into its non-religious curriculum.  You are entirely misinformed."
"""A freshman legislator in the Alaska House of Representatives has demonstrated to this fallibility by pushing his hate-based agenda since taking office – against black Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and Alaskan women, so far. While some of his behavior since taking office has caused some concern, most of us can agree that he crossed a line this week when he verbally abused the women of Alaska, specifically targeting our sisters who live in village and rural Alaska.""

Hold on a second... pushing a ""hate-based agenda"" that disparages ""black Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and Alaskan women"" causes ""some concern"" to the authors of this op-ed, but he only ""crossed the line"" after ""he verbally abused the women of Alaska""? 

For the record, I believe Rep. Eastman's comments were shameful. This, however, is the worst possible response I could have imagined."
"Ms. Perkins has obviously not yet recovered from having a black, forward thinking Democrat as her president.

Non south Africa s who are black and have received citizenship qualify now for being classed as black for BEE deals. They can get shares or qualify as black run business to provide goods or services
"I am not the one ignorant of reality in this discussion.  I have pointed out that refugees have certain rights and exemptions that are different from other migrants - black letter law.

What you think the majority of Canadians may want is immaterial if it contravenes our supreme law and that has been so since 1982 when the Constitution was patriated and the Charter passed into law.

Since international and domestic law allows refugees claimants to enter Canada by any means necessary and make a claim as Convention refugee and they are entitled to legal representation, why would lawyers be disbarred?  You did read the recent SCOC decision that struck down the amendments to the human smuggling provisions of the IRPA as ""overbroad"" did you not?  See R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59

The is no chance of Canada withdrawing from international conventions and agreements on refugees.

The safe third country agreement is the government exploiting a loophole in the Singh decision."

Police Dashcam Video Shows Violent Arrest Of Austin School Teacher Breaion King 

Prosecutors cleared King, a 26-year-old elementary teacher, of a resisting arrest charge after viewing the video of the June 15, 2015 arrest. The 112-pound woman told the local newspaper she has hired lawyers as she considers a suit against the department. “I’ve become fearful to live my life,” King said. “I would rather stay home. I’ve become afraid of the people who are supposed to protect me and take care of me.”

"I'm a Christian and I understand that there are other religious holidays or agnostic or atheist beliefs in December.  It is inclusive to say; ""Happy Holidays"" or ""Have a great winter break!"" Instead of assuming ""Merry Christmas"" speaks to all.  Donning a black face is insensitive and stupid.  I am, however, protective of a person's right to be racist and wear whatever offensive costume he or she wants at a private party.  Shame on her, but she is allowed.  This reminds me of Molly Ivins protecting the rights of the KKK to have their parade.  This is freedom of speech, right or wrong, sensitive and inclusive or insensitive and exclusive."
We live in a cesspool.
"Protecting one's family is admirable. However, the purpose of providing one's name is to increase the likelihood that comments are not personal attacks.  

I'm going to tell you a little story.

The first home I remember was in Veteran's Village, Ames, Iowa.  And my first playmate was a black child whose name was Woody.  I, of course, didn't realize he was black until years later when I saw photos.

My parents later told me that they caught a lot of grief (I guess now we would call it abuse) for being nice to them.  They didn't have a car, so my mother would take Woody's mother shopping with her, for example.

Later in life, my father merely said about Woody's father:  ""He fought in the war too.""  

My parents ""signed their names.""

If you are truly worried about being abused or your family being abused, in Langley, please then consider what it would be like for a Syrian child seeking refuge in our country.  Do we give love or do we give hate that is driven by fear?"
"ANTIFA becoming exposed!

"Ordinary Chinese do care about free speech, but there is a lot at stake. In the past there have been political cleansing campaigns where police drag you away and put you in hidden jails, called ""black jails"", where no one, including your family and friends, knows you are there. There is a lot more at stake when unknown police can detain you this way. Would you take the chance?

So you post your opinion, get on the radar of the CCP. The next time you might be detained instead of having your writing deleted. After this you might disappear for a couple of weeks or years, tried in a secret court, found guilty and sent away to some cold place for hard labour. Would you so easily speak up?

There is the North American way to voice dissent and there are other ways in other countries. I try not to judge too harshly until I walk in the cotton shoes of the Chinese. I did, and did not like what I saw."
"Yes, I hope these wymen will now march for the right of older men to wear black socks with sandals and Speedos."
"Whether or not these sour grapes Democrats decide to attend  the inaugaration or not is really insignificant. Maybe they could march with all the man hating feminists as well.   I expect that Congresspersons John Lewis and Maxine Waters will  keep up their race hustling along with the rest of the Black Caucus keeping Black people fearful, angry, resentful, and hating Whitey to keep them on the Democrat voting block to put these parasites in office to live high on the hog off the government.  On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.  Their beloved President Obama isn't going away though. He will resume his community organizing domestically as a race hustler keeping Black people on the Democrat voting block as a dependency class.  And he will go on the speaking circuit internationally getting very rich badmouthing his own country and advocating one world government under the United Nations in order to save the planet from GLO-BULL warming"
An Irish American and an African American that fought for the common people.  A thing of beauty.  They will certainly be missed.  The ceremony was a pleasure to watch.
Some how we are supposed to believe everything Indians and blacks say. In my neighbourhood every Indian is up to no good besides the drinking and drugs and sneaking into apartment buildings at night and defecating and urinating in the stair wells. Blacks have accosted me a number of times . Of course I racial profile.
"We'll see if President-elect Biff has followed tax laws, but what we do know is that he's a narcissistic sociopathic sex predator who has slimed his way to the top using the media brilliantly to smear everyone on all sides and dupe us into the false equivalency of comparing his lifelong lies and crimes to the mostly untrue and/or mostly minor errors of the Clintons.

Undocumented workers in the U.S. commit crimes at a *lower rate* than U.S. citizens. The IRS is *independent* of the executive branch (and the Clintons) in all but the most conspiratorial FOX-addled brains. The lawful election was won by two million in total votes by Hillary, so Clownstick has *no real mandate*. The ""leftist mobs"" are a *tiny fraction* of those expressing their horror of this lowlife racist creep, and the deplorable holes and trolls he will now enable.

These are all facts. But it's the age of Trump. Semi-literate, and semi-sane trolls ""no"" in their gut that the first black president is a Kenyan Muslim."
"If drugs are a crime and you do not want them to be, change the law. If you are attempting to stop drugs from entering society then stop it. The fact is there is a market for drugs. It is not pursued by free open market enterprise so, it is pursued by black market interests. That is a seedy side of the coin. See Chicago. That is where all American population centers are headed. It is the drug market creating these problems. Stop the drug market. There is a lot of influence, money and power behind it so, ask yourself why it still exists. Because those rich, powerful, influential people want it to exist."

"GMO foods have a 100% safety record, far better than ""natural"" or ""organic"".  In fact, GMO is far better for the environment as the crops require less water, fewer, if any, pesticides and increased yields which means few acres under cultivation.  On top of that, GMO foods are healthier as they can provide vitamins and minerals that non-GMO foods don't supply. 
In particular Golden Rice could prevent thousands of young people in Africa from gong blind due to vitamin A deficiencies.  Unfortunately, this rice has been banned in much of Africa due to the dishonest scare tactics of rabid environmentalists.  When confronted with this fact the environmentalists retort is that their should be another way to prevent the blindness, a truly stupid response since there is no other way.   The result?  Thousands of young people are condemned to blindness all for the radical ideology of some environmentalists .
PS, I have no connection to any producer, user, seller etc of GMO products."

"Marelise, your article today seems more controversial. What I do not understand is how a certain section of our population believes that certain spaces belong exclusively to them. A black woman gets abused on Sewende Laan. Tumi seems to have problems at Jakaranda Radio. Several (more than 30 years) yeas ago I was a young boy listening to Radio Suid Afrika and there was this young kid who called the station to ask why Nelson Mandela not hanged given that he had committed treason. The sae kid might have possibly been Nelson Mandela's admirer before he died. Something tells me that if Tumi sticks long enough, the same group that rejects her now will end up being her ardent supporters."
"This is the kind of hate crimes that Donald Trump has given rise to.  In fact, shortly after this occurred a member of the mosque was taped saying that this was because of Trump, but this was not mentioned in this article. 
Hate crimes against Muslims, blacks and other visible minorities have skyrocketed throughout North America because the man in the White House who has given them license to do so. The very day the world is sent into chaos because of Trumps Muslim ban from 7 countries that the Cato Inst. says are responsible for 0 American deaths (but excludes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE who are responsible for hundreds / thousands of American deaths because  Trump  has businesses there)  this tragedy occurs. Trump and Bannon this is on you.  You fan the flames of racism and hatred against our brothers and sisters of colour. You said on TV you favour Christians over Muslim immigrants. Canadians don't want your condolences.  Keep them and lift the travel ban against Muslims NOW!"
"They have also simply played bad baseball. Walking two batters in the same inning, both of whom score, throwing error allowing another run, that's 3 of the 4 runs Atlanta scored. Add in the constant inability to get runners in from third with less than 2 outs, just bad baseball. I also think Black has to take some credit, with the offense struggling, there have been several situations that were just screaming bunt, Black lets them swing away, EVERY time has resulted in a strikeout, pop up, or ground ball double play. The other day the root guys were fawning over Black for inserting Valaika, who went 3 for 3, just showed me the error of continuing to send Story out there day after day."

Lol you absolutely described every single politician on this planet. Obama spoke to his gullible black supporters. What'd they get. Sky high murder rates amongst themselves and a large percent more poverty. You speak as if this tactic is new. It's certainly not. it certainly isn't a defence of trump but an observation of all politics. Of course you die hard lovers or haters are too blinded by partisanship to see it either way.
"There is this thing you Leftys need to learn about, please google it, its called FALSE EQUIVALENCE. Like the Slavery and the US War Between the States of 1861 that was faught over Cotton Tariffs.

I am sure your wife and mixed race children are proud of daddy for demeaning those who actually act upon their beliefs.  EXXON-VALDEZ  and all of the other resulting spills of this black snake through the heart of Alaska are just so good for everybody especially the environment.  The marine life of the Sound has never recovered after all of these years.  The same will happen in the Missouri River drainage except in this case it will be the humans who have to move for lack of water.

"Okay. Thank you for being civil. I believe in core values, such as our Constitution. I have no faith in Career Politicians, be they right, left or center. I am a Democrat-but I guess 'old school' - like the JFK thinking. 

Now onto your questions.
(Q) how do you feel about racial profiling?
(A) If a race or ethnic group is mentioned because people need to help find a suspect, it is necessary, but not because of the group-but because of the identification only. Like blond hair v black hair v brown hair.

(Q)  Do you think the DP is worried that posting the race of the suspect would be considered profiling?
(A) Yes, but maybe not why you would think. I believe, sadly, that media and people are so worried about appearing 'PC' that they are terrified of any implied profiling. Even when it isn't.
 
In the end, we all want the same things-to be the best country and people we can be?  Our route to that may vary, but civily & together we can work towards that.

A powerful privileged Canadian has just belittled you and called you a slave. Funny? Or have you just been squished, put in your place? Shamed?  This is how we need to look at power imbalance and racist humour. Not to defend the perpetrator but to advocate for the human being on the painful receiving end of the ""joke""."
"we know who/what satan is. to invite him into your meetings is a stupid idea. and it is time that people stood up, spoke out, and pushed back. if you don't want to join a moslem prayer, the constitution says the gov't can't make you. same with a Christian prayer. no one can MAKE you pray, or JOIN a church. that is what the law is about. i personally will not pray to anyone but the Christian God; i will not participate, bow my head, raise my hands, close my eyes, etc. etc. i will NOT. but look at the state of our nation since we started preaching the religion of secular humanism and evolution. we are hip deep in a cesspool."
If there was a Scripture verse teaching people of African and European descent can't be fed at the same counters this would be a valid comparison but there's not.
"What a pinhead Trump is. Instead of being concerned about the anthem or the flag why isn't he concerned that African American people are still going through horrendous treatment 60 years after Little Rock and other segregation era policies. 50 years after the Black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and these people still have to go through this.

That's what the concern should be, not about the stupid anthem or flag. How ignorant does your president have to get before you clueless folks who back him  tell him he's a fool and a complete embarrassment to the USA."
"Amazing how these, so called, reporters are able to look past Clinton's actions, including Hilary's attacks on them, versus and Trump's words. They and their democrat bosses were only too willing to bring down two black guys named Herman Cain and Clarence Thomas. Two men who, by the way, Obama couldn't shine their shoes.
I'm sure Juanita Broderick's interviews about Bill Clinton's attack on her can be found online. You might have to go to the evil and biased FOX or Drudge to find it rather than the noble and balanced Washington Post  but it's available.  Watch it and try to convince yourself she made the whole thing up. It's heartbreaking; but  to Hillary she was just another ""Bimbo Eruption"" to be managed"
"Lets say that there is increased vetting. And lets say that vetting process involves in depth questioning of ALL prospective immigrants.

Now lets also say that the Immigration officer is taught to specifically look for signs that perhaps the prospective immigrant sitting in front of her or him may not have been exactly truthful when responding to written questions, on, for example, gender equality. Perhaps a hint would the prospective immigrant's wife covered in a head to toe black veil. 

Now that could be the woman's choice, so the immigration officer probes a little further. Maybe asks the woman some questions, and checks the man's reaction.

Does this sound invasive? So what?

"This article needed editing.  If he weren't a bishop would he be allowed to ramble with self serving points? 
He laments the museum's lack of RCC presence.  The RCC was insignificant in lives of black persons. If anything, the violent hostility against blacks by Irish Catholics especially in NYC and Memphis are examples.  N The RCC didn't rush to the South after slavery like Protestant churches to offer social assistance.
Encouraging people to visit a museum is safe.  As a bishop & black man he asserts no leadership in the more controversial arena of parish life - engaging RCs in exorcising bias against blacks.  Coming from the Southside of Chicago, too, I was sharply aware of the intense prejudice against blacks. MLK said of his experience in this solidly Catholic environment: ""I have never seen, even in Mississippi and Alabama, mobs as hateful as I've seen here in Chicago."" This slice of RC presence should be in the museum. RCs were a minor note, at best, in healing & reconciliation."
"Well...I think Ms. Staight should double check her info...since ""mass murders"" have been defined as 4 or more killed in an single incident...minorities (blacks, hispanics, asians) have VERY high rates compared to their percentage of the population.  And with the black on black crime in liberal controlled cesspools like chicago, baltimore, etc.  the problem is a bit more complex than she envisions.  Her agenda and skewed viewpoint aside, she needs to do a LOT more work!  We COULD say, based on party affiliation or political viewpoint, that the vast majority of these mass shootings are done by democrats of left wing persuasion.  RACE is immaterial to the discussion...WHAT the underlying mental health and belief systems are the problem...not the ""tool"" misused."
"I've come to the conclusion you have your own issues.  What AlexZander was pointing out, correctly, is black people are vastly more likely to be killed by other black people than by a cop.  That does not mean there are no bad cops only that the cop killings are twig in a bonfire."
"We as a country can't agree on how best to protect the country. How can we expect to agree on anything else. And those on the left wonder why gun sales have rose the past eight years. It's human nature to look out for one self and family first.

Who has put the black community in the inter-cities, surround by gangs? Who looks at Trump as a bigger threat to the country, then radical Islamic terrorist? Who had an inappropriate relationship, by their own admission, in the oval office? When pointing a figure three are always pointing back."

That's exactly what it wants you to think, and then dismiss it as ""mere Churchianity"" . No, Americhriatianity is a dangerous, anti-Christian, Gospel-betraying, dangerous cult masking itself as ""church"" (like Satan appearing in the guise of Light, Lucifer).  Americhristianity's Trinity is: the leader (German: Der Führer), the gun (law-and-order-or-else!), and the flag (draping the cross into invisibility - ""the Other"" shall die on it; it burns in black neighborhoods; it is not the Cross of Jesus Christ, nor is the flag the symbol of the US Flag and the values the Flag represents, but its vile usurpation).

"I agree that fitting in is key. It is not just about merit. That being said…true story…picture a Senor HR executive with a major Bay Street Bank telling a group of black employees that the reasons why there are no black employees in the management pipeline is that there are no black MBAs at the bank. Also, picture the faces and absolute disappointment and horror of the black MBAs that were around the table with her. The point is, there is not always an opportunity to move beyond merit to then fit in. How would the black MBAs in this firm get a chance to prove to executives that they fit in if HR (HR!) did not know they exist. Career Advancement  101? It would be great if the opportunity was always there to exercise Career Advancement principles. There are so many other examples that I could cite, however at the end of the day, I am guiding my children to be entrepreneur as I do not want them to have the same unfortunate experiences that so many of us have had in Corp Canada."
"In this new political era I'd support restoring some parental rights to parents of 18 yr olds.

"I very much agree. The ongoing demands that Native people's rights be terminated is beyond disturbing. People who believe they are a victim because Native Americans still retain as much as they can of their own ancient cultures, are victims because  Native people retain any land at all, and also think they are victims because Native people do have treaty rights as payment for their land are out there. Talk about victim mentality, free-loader, want something for nothing.  Native people account for less than 2% of the entire American population.  They aren't taking anything from anyone.  

I can't help but wonder if the ADN would publish comments insisting that African Americans' rights be terminated, and that Black people be relegated back to slavery.     Somehow I doubt they would. But comments that promote taking away Native rights are given a free pass.   They invariably dominate the comments on any article about Native people and offer nothing but vicious and untrue stereotypes."
"The media accurately described Trump as a racist. How featherbrained are you, anyway? He supports Neo Nazis and Fred Trump, his Dad, was a KKK advocate.

We get it. You don't think a black man should be able to be president.

"As I posted previously, I don't know about a flag. What I do know is that a little less than a year ago, my boys' team played Weld Central, and after the game they told me (without being prompted) that the Weld team had used racial slurs against our black players throughout the game. I confirmed this with some of the other players. They told me this last year--not in response to the story this weekend. Dismiss our experience if you want, but it leads me to believe that the allegations of slurs being used on the field could likely be true."

"""The ACA is what used to be the Republican idea for health care. But since a black president implemented it, it needs to be destroyed"".
Two things! The majority of Republicans never supported Heritagecare, and if you have actually read the Heritagecare plan you would see it would have only mandated catastrophic coverage which would have had little to no effect on existing health insurance plans and wouldn't have forced individuals who had little need for insurance to purchase expensive plans. Obamacare never was and still isn't a Republican plan."

"Some of the main reasons why graduates cannot find jobs include, in order of importance:
- The economy is in a slump (especially so our mining industry)
- The graduate is qualified for the wrong job
- The graduate is not a sparkling acquisition
- Racial prejudice plays a role.
I would put my money on the first reason. The last one rarely affects deserving black graduates. Rather the opposite, since they are in fact highly favoured by the steeply tilted legislative playing field. So Mr Zwane is clearly out of his depth. Perhaps the wrong person is washing the cars?"
"""we should not waste a good crisis""  Abedian & Mantell have certainly not wasted the crisis, using it to write trite inanities.

KPMG were, as the authors say, merely the hitmen.  What about the Zumafia paymasters instructing them?   KPMG wrote k@k but didn't force SARS, Mashiane Moodley & Monama or Adv Sikhakhane to lie.  Their report was trashed in J van Loggerenberg's book; SARS & the media didn't need the GuptaEmails. And the v Loggerenberg/Walters/Tobacco/SARS thang remains murky.

Why, too, was ANC SCOPA whip, Nyami Booi at a SARS press conference?

The new President Protector unlawfully and incompetently assaulted the Constitution and banks for doing what the New Vigilantes want KPMG to have done: refuse to condone Zupta illegalities.  But the rageratti are silent on this, leaving it to the DA.

"Judy, they're""illegal"" because they're breaking the law by being here.  That distinguishes them from immigrants who followed our laws and came here legally.  You can argue semantics and call them undocumented if you like, but it doesn't change the facts.   My grandparents followed the law and immigrated legally, I suspect most people's kin also followed the laws in place at the time as well.  Even yours, most likely.  But Judy, how is it ""social justice"" to reward people that breaks our laws, when millions of others follow the system and have to wait for their chance?  How is it ""social justice"" to allow these people to compete for jobs and government benefits with with American citizens that are struggling to get by?  Where is the justice in that?  And the fact that the citizens being affected in this way are disproportionately black opens you up to charges of racism, although I doubt that's you, you probably just haven't thought it through all the way, preferring emotion to logic."

"Barry may be intelligent, but he's also a condescending, opinionated, pansy who, in my opinion, was ill qualified to be president, was elected because he was a black man who could speak well, and has taken this country in the wrong direction in several ways.

That doesn't mean that Trump will do better. A Trump administration will offer many significant challenges. I can only hope that those leaders in Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, will hold the line on any legislation Trump may propose that is inimical to the good health of our nation.
As to the ridiculousness of my statement, it's true and accurate. When Barry was elected and re-elected, I was depressed for weeks. I know what Friedman and many Clinton supporters are going through and they have my sincere sympathy."

But in reality, not everyone is Catholic and should have to follow.  By allowing safe abortions and free birth control there are less of them.  If we support women in all ways, they will develop self confidence.  This is what will slow down premarital sex.   Young girls who are not self assured are the ones that think a man will take care of them.  They also believe that sex will get and keep said man."
"Like Mike Brown? The maority of police shootings have been justified. Not all, but so many that calling them all murders and pointing the wrong fingers does nothing to realize the situation 

The problem isn't why so many young blacks are getting shot by police, but why are so many young blacks engaging in crime.  And in the clear case of Michael Brown, violently resisting arrest?  Michael Brown tried to kill a cop and has been martyred by the black community. This in itself is divisive."
"Even Supreme Court justice Scalia said that allowing religion to trump non-discrimination laws would set a bad precedent. People would then be a law unto themselves, being able to decide which laws they did and didn’t want to follow. Chaos would ensue.
Fifty years ago, racists were forced by law to serve black customers when the Civil Rights Act was passed. The government can definitely *force* citizens to serve other citizens they personally don’t approve of when it benefits society as a whole."
"What has Trump done to help black people?

You can't accuse the Clintons unless your guy beats them.  So please share what he's done that's so much better."
"""2) What exactly does ""otherwise"" cover in the law...does ""otherwise"" cover everything. ""

Wow. Not sure I've ever met anyone who didn't know the meaning of the word otherwise. It means the government can't compel any speech, whether political or not. Now are you going to ask me the meany of ""any"" and ""not""?

""3) You told me two days ago the Baker cannot be compelled to make a political statement.""

No, I said political OR OTHERWISE. How many times will that have to be said for you to grasp it? The government cannot compel ANY speech. Is that clear enough for you?

""that is why a black baker cannot discriminate against a skinhead""

Wrong. Skinhead is not a class of person."
6 Muslims in Quebec city might disagree if they were alive to tell you what they thought...just one example that comes to mind...oh and how about black people at a prayer meeting? Ring any bells?....oh here's another Timothy Mcveigh? In fact the list is pretty lengthy...and we're not talking about a little property damage sir...
"I'll let you do some of your own googling but a couple of quick examples of what Colin Kaepernick has done, since he started these protests.  He has pledged to donate $1,000,000 in small increments to organizations that help oppressed communities.  He has donated $800,000 as of August of this year.  Some of the organizations that he has donated to include boys and girls club, 100 suits for 100 men, J Cole Dream foundation, meals on wheels, Black Veterans social justice and silence is violence.

I don't have the time or desire to research every instance of charity and community service each of the protesting players has done but I assure you they are doing more than just kneeling during the anthem.

I suppose these athletes helping their community doesn't fit your pre-conceived narrative so I'm sure you won't take the time to actually look at all the good things the NFL and their players are doing.  For your narrative it's easier to focus on the bad apples that reinforce your opinion."
"Bad assumption.  I made Eagle Scout and I was a Scout Master for many years, and I know boys at that age.  Their has always been good reason for segregating boys in that environment as they focus much better....this is true in scouts, it is true in many private schools and it has been true in military basic training.  This has nothing to do with a girl defending herself...once the offense has been committed, the lawyers will come running for a quick settlement payday."
"Once again, Mr/Ms Milbank has put together a list worded to make the President sound quilty of all he/she purports. For example, if a Democrat Pres had come in and fired an FBI Director who had clear ties with R's and had lied to Congress, the press would have praised his/her good sense!  Dems never get this kind of treatment in the press.  When they hold up someone like FDR as one of their icons, the press never reminds them that it was FDR who ordered Japanese Americans into internment camps or that their party voted against getting rid of ""lynching"" of Americans who were black.  

Find a subject, and try to do some impartial research and inform the readers, if you can, please!"
"(Part one of two)  —Mary Ann McGivern wrote about a man released from prison, without mentioning whether or not he is Black.  That leaves the impression he is Black.  Ibram X.

"""Canada must try to lead the world’s response. ""

That seems to be the only reference to Canada leading in the entire article despite the article title of "" African famine should be Canada’s moment to lead""

Most of the article, of course, is slamming Trump and the U.S. for not continuing to provide the bulk of the relief as if there are no other options.

And all of these frequent ""Canada's chance to lead"" or ""Canada should be leading"" are nothing more than a slightly disguised way of self-esteem building. Canada is not doing anything in the particular area being discussed, but it so naturally qualified that its surprising.  But not just participating. Canada is so good that if it did participate, it would be as the leader. This just contributes to a delusional self-image because this theme is repeated for what seems like multiple times a week."
"Race baiters like this author are actually terrified that President Trump will help the inner cities and free the black population from the shackles of the Democratic Party that keeps them in those terrible, hopeless and dependent conditions.  I predict that should Trump make some headway in this respect, his share of the black vote will rise in 2020 to 20% from 8% in 2016."
"I think it's wrong in the sense that, 1. most manuals recommend not just red to red, but start with one battery (which one, I forget) and 2. ground to the frame, not to the dead negative.  (I saw, and agree with, your comments on that above.)  I had fun recently, dead battery, bought a charging pack, tried to boost, probably f'd up getting a good ground (I tried a dozen times.) then had my girlfriend call CAA.  He came, red to red, black to black - bammo - car's running.  GF pretty much insisted that I ask him what I was doing wrong - ah, do I have to? - and he said basically, ground to frame is nice in theory and maybe adds a small sliver of safety, but it's hard to get a good ground, black to black is fine in the real world.  You know, except for a very small chance the battery explodes, blinding you in one eye and horribly scarring you for life while your GF runs off with the CAA guy.  Again, my point is that I shouldn't be allowed anywhere near jumping a car."
"Portugal and Spain had large Moorish populations (that were converted under duress to Catholicism). I would call them diverse - the Moors originated in North Africa. The Spanish Empire had a lot of interbreeding with the natives in Latin America. The Portuguese intermarried (and may marriage is a loose term here) with local women from Brazil to Goa. While the top positions were held by the ""purebreds"", an empire needs a large number of middle and lower middle class workers, soldiers, bureaucrats, etc. In Latin America, these obs were filled by the mixed races. The pure blooded natives were at the bottom, like the blacks in the USA.

As for China, as pointed out, their empires contained Chinese, Mongols, Koreans, Burmese, Tibetans, Naxi, Central Asians, etc. Those who don't know much about Asia might think all these countries are the same, but they are not. They speak different languages, have different religions and customs, etc."
nothing worse than a black delusional monkey
"Not sure why they need any more rights than you or I currently have.  I know I would morally support them as neighbours and friends.  Do Asian, Black, Middle Eastern, Newfies etc. surrender their identity when they join the rest of society; no, they become part of the fabric of that society and that is a good thing."
"Racism cannot be excused period. No one is that ignorant that they will allow racists to excuse themselves by applying the label of ""political correctness"" to any objection to their unacceptable behaviour. We know what racist bloggers are up to and Canadians will never let them get away with it. She used the N word in public to refer to a black woman who was complaining about racial discrimination at the York Region District School Board. When the trustee herself publicly engages in racist behaviour it is proof positive that the complainant is correct."
"Brilliant Canadian expat Malcolm Gladwell surmised the election of President Obama gave American racists the excuse to voice their thoughts like they hadn't done in decades.  ""Racism is dead cause we have a black president, so...""

The misogynists aren't even waiting for President Hillary Clinton to do the same."
"Phil:   We could spend pages debating the ""demerits"" of Clinton and Trump.  No purpose served by doing so.  Trump won the election and his are the personal issues which are impacting the future of our country and the rest of the world.  It's simply a distraction to defend Trump by atttacking Clinton.  The election is over.  We now have to work to protect our nation and all Americans from the impulsive actions of Mr. Trump.  regards  Gary Crum"
BLM is trying to jump-start the black victim industry in Canada.  This is just another step in that direction.
"remoore:  You don't think the NFL and NCAA will just continue on if the fan base leaves?  The NFL feels the problem right now, they are in denial why it is happening.  These uber rich players that somehow succeeded in a racist country are protesting.

Don't you see the irony.  Their message should be one of hard work pays off and to the black community, you can succeed if you work hard.  America is not fundamentally a racist country.  We have have racist people, of all colors.  Bet you didn't know that Democrat President Woodrow Wilson re-segregated the government after Republican Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.  Or that more Republicans in Congress voted for the Civil Rights Act than did Democrats.  Facts for thought."
"The NFL will lose a portion of their fan base and a significant portion of potential fans. The NFL players decided that anyone who isn't African-American is just a racist bigot. The NFL players are protesting solely for African-Americans. Oh wait, then it was people of ""color"". Oh wait, then there was blood in the streets and this wasn't their country. NFL players' median salary exceeds $900K but lets protest income inequality?

The NFL has stifled any other free speech because the racist message reflects the ""values"" of the NFL. The NFL allows A-A players to raise fists for ""Black Power"" in the workplace. The A-A NFL players create a racially hostile work environment. Kiz and DP crew are down with institutional bigotry and discrimination that violates the Civil Rights Act. The double-standard and hypocrisy are equally laughable and pathetic."
"""... the men and women who died fighting to preserve freedoms""
As usual, Trump's preening patriotism is a bubble easily burst by the pin of his blatant hypocrisy.
Trump dodged the draft in the sixties in order to avoid any risk when it came to standing up for his country.
Meanwhile, Kaepernick is risking his own financial and physical security today in standing up for injustices against black citizens."
What a joke.  Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country.  Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians.  They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything.  Pot calling the kettle black for sure.  The manipulation and hypocrisy coming from the democrats is mind boggling to say the least.  But we must understand they are drinking a kool aid that distorts the mind. Its called free lovism and situational ethics. Hail Hillary!!!!
"I think you missed the point.  The point is, everyone should be treated equally.  I dont really care if this guy wants to make a cake for a gay couple or not - but he certainly should not be allowed to discriminate against a specific subset of people that he does not agree with for his own reasons.

Im sure the same argument about why choose to eat somewhere where the people there dont want to serve you was used for when Blacks were trying to gain equal rights as well.  The point was not that they did not have access to the same types of things elsewhere - it was that they should not need to go to another store to buy the exact same product just because of the color of their skin.  Choosing not to serve someone because of the fact they are gay, is not really any differnet."
"Yes, Obama was elected twice while being black. That seemed to bring out the racists from under their rocks. Yeah, that's the president's fault. Geez."
"Actually...blacks DID serve in the Confederate forces...true, mostly as militia units, starting in 1861.  Henry Louis Gates, of obama's ""the police acted stupidly""fame, spent three years searching for black union troops who fought at Gettysburg.  He found none.  The ONLY black known to have fought AT Gettysburg is one Charles F. Lutz, a private in Company F, 8th Regiment, Louisana Infantry (a Confederate unit.)  We DO know he lost an arm while attacking Cemetery Hill, and that he survived the war.  FREE blacks fought for the union as well, but not until after the EP, in 1863.  the EP, did NOT free the slaves in the northern states that still allowed slavery. (which is kind of ballsy of Lincoln, free slaves in another country, but not his own!  Secession did not violate the Constitution, and whatever the reason, states had that right. Lincoln wrote in strong favor of secession for Texas from Mexico!  States were STILL more important than the National government back then."
Black people were also civilized long before your ancestors were.
I am amazed (but pleased) that the Globe did not censor you for saying that. Seems we are normally not allowed to state that  fact. Blacks commit crimes against Cops way more than the reverse
"It's insulting speech, it's hatred, it's discrimination, it promotes violence and it has no place in a civilized society. Would you defend a bunch of racists yelling the N* word at blacks passing by? Or C* word to women passing by? There is a fine line that one is to not cross in public and if anyone like the Democrat heavy ACLU wants to defend these scum then they are promoting racism, hatred and violence! Where's the public apology from the ACLU for defending the KKK?"
"Fair enough.. As one legend to another, have you actually thought it out on your own?  The individual right was also a myth to the black slaves at the time of our forefathers.  Not much foresight there."
"Are you really that thick?  You certainly aren't that humorous.  You really believe that the only reason that Republicans wanted to see Obama's birth Certificate was because he's black.?  The fact his wife on several occasions called him Kenyan, he called himself Kenyan had nothing to do with? Good grief!"
"Yes, that was a racist comment, and its author is an embarrassment to whatever creed he professes.

That said, note that there is racism on both sides.  Consider Black Lives Matter.   BLM teaches that Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.  BLM is committed to disrupting the nuclear family structure, advocating Black “villages” where they support each other as extended families.  BLM is also committed to dismantling so-called “cis-gender privilege.”  They are working to rebuild the Black liberation movement, based on the idea that virulent anti-Black racism permeates our society.  They teach that the imprisonment of black people state violence.  You be the judge."
And both black and Latinos as well.
"It's not difficult to figure out: a production in 2017 will seek relevance in 2017, not in 1962 or 1992.

I understand that what Trump ""mutters"" is minor stuff for you.  It's not minor for women.  Especially given the fact that Trump is currently the most powerful person in the world, and the fact that so many people, especially men, make excuses for him and what he says.

Of course what he says and does isn't the same thing as the sexual slavery Atwood wrote about.  Neither was the United States in 1985 when Atwood wrote it.  It was a warning then . . .  and it's a warning now."
"Grisham is certainly correct in his message.  The celebration of Christ-mas is not about Santa and making sure that the economy of the business world ends the year in the black.  His efforts to remind the world of this is consistent with his chosen profession as a Pastor.

However his methods are what are troubling.  They are the same as the majority of TV Evangelists, which are to focus people on them and not the words in the Bible.  To go to a 'santa' line and hand out reminders about christmas or to even speak politely to the parents about their religious beliefs are a worthy activities for his ministry, but to openly confront parents and distress their children loudly in public is nothing but confrontational.  Jesus was only confrontational to the money changers in the temple.

No, Grisham is not Isaiah or a prophet, he is a celebrity wannabe doing his best to give true Christianity a bad rap.  The message is sound and truthful, his chosen methods and reasons are not."
"This has to be the joke not only of this century but the last one too. A dictator, a despot, a person who has diminished Zimbabwe into one of the poorest countries of Africa, with one of the highest rates of HIV/AIDS.

"Because they may be the only work in your field or the best paying work in your field that is present.  If a Nazi Skin Head has to hire fairly because of the law for his bank, and he is the only Banker within 20 miles out in the mid-west, the black employees should not have to give up any benefits or be kept from company funded gatherings just because the Nazi owner does not want to pay for blacks to come as a matter of upholding his religious/political beliefs.  People can only find work where work is available & not all work is necessarily available outside of these businesses.  Say like with the only hospital in a town perhaps which happens to be Catholic run. 

Basically, if you are funded in part, by the government, such as a college or hospitals & therefore you must hire non-catholics who are qualified for the jobs you offer in order to keep that tax funded support then you must afford them the same benefits working outside your business offers or choose to give up the funds."
LCBO is a joke what gives the government the right to run a business and compete with Joe/Joyce citizen?    It should be left up to individual men and women.   Now pot (yuck pot !) Junior and his gang want in on that business.  How is a guy/girl supposed to compete with government??
"Black Lives Matter in itself is a very divisive means of proving a point. While I agree with the rationale of bringing awareness to equality, it is demonstrative of the very thing it is trying to promote.
The minorities across our nation are proving a point, but, why can't we utilize a slogan that includes ALL minority groups that are affected due to racial and ethnic biases.
Wouldn't ALL LIVES MATTER be a better portrayal of the goal?"
"Black person: Sesssion's bankrupted the KKK in his prosecution of them in Alabama

Gay person: Marriage equality, despite democrats coming late to the party.

Caplan would have spent his time more usefully in a discussion of the socio-economic condition of everyday Black South Africans over 20 years on from the end of apartheid government.  His take on the dynamic of corruption should be most interesting.
"Ukraine was Obama and Hillary's big play. What does the average American care about it and Russia's claim to Crimea? Little, I suggest. Nor does the average American care about who runs Syria. They'll care much more that Islamic State is running rampant in the country, and so they should. Again, up to this point events in Syria reflect the foreign policies of Obama and Clinton.

You can hypothesize all you like about what Trump may get from it personally, but it doesn't change the fact that he's staked out a strong foreign policy position that could attract many American voters."
Another multimillionaire black man whining.
"Liz's article, commencing with a call to action via an epigram by Neil deGrasse Tyson to ""get smart,"" is a brilliant personal and professional cautionary tale which all must heed. It is instructive to understand that no matter the changing and unchanging of different geographic demographics, whitelash rears its very public head:  at rock concerts during which the confederate flag is raised; when African American leaders are mass murdered in their church; where in HAWAI'I, racism is manifested in passive-aggressive whispers and gestures.  It is present where every day, a black person, whether a minister or fast food worker, is pulled over by a law enforcement officer and is forced to comply quietly and meekly, enduring humiliation just in case the officer is a racist and has license to murder. Re-energized acts of racism and all forms of bigotry necessitate the call to ""get smart"" by informing, volunteering, engaging on every level to inspire the human race to ""get smart' again. IMUA"
"I had a more comprehensive reply, but it was censored.

Anyway, see the Financial Time's headline today:

""London Bridge Attacker Known Member of Extremist Network,  Khuram filmed praying to black Islamist flag in Regent's Park.""

The point here is that radical Islamists like Khuram need to be dealt with before they commit atrocities.

Khan's strategy is to deal with terrorists after they have committed atrocities.

If Khan had advocated an effective strategy for dealing with terrorists like Khuram, then the latest tragedy might have been prevented.

Khan's failed policy of complacency and lack of prevention is unacceptable.

Since this post is criticizing a globalist like Khan, perhaps the censors will eliminate it as well.

"When a developer wants a tax break, they need to be specific.  They also need to quantify the ROI for the taxpayer so a win-win can be reasonably concluded.

Well, there was and they did.  Since the late 1940s Alberta was provided with the riches and royalties to develop the petroleum and secondary and tertiary industries and they never did.  Each time the pi$$ed it all away and now, once again, they are in financial dire straits and expecting BC to allow them to crap in their own backyard with environmental and oil spill inevitable disasters.

"Is Trump hostile towards Muslims? He said at the National Prayer Breakfast, ""We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered, and oppressed by ISIS killers."" He said his tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture “was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.”
The campaign statements Trump made can be interpreted differently than the way the State presented it, and in any case, may not represent the current intentions.
In his ruling, Judge Watson said, ""It is undisputed that the Executive Order does not facially discriminate for or against any particular religion, or for or against religion versus non-religion.

"Excuse me...."" perfectly legal herb "" ?  No it's not. It's still against federal law. Many safety sensitive jobs require employees to be drug free---and pot is rightly considered a drug .Over time many will lose their jobs because they foolishly thought because pot was claimed to be "" legal "" they could use it when they couldn't. One of the problems that was pointed out in the debate over if pot should be made legal or not was how it was harder to prove if a person was impaired with pot.  Pot supporters didn't care in the least about public safety in their quest to legalize the drug. Even in comments to this story they boast in how it will be hard to prove . Last week we read in the Dispatch how the black market isn't going away as pot supporters claimed it would. Every claim pot supporters made to get votes is turning out to be false.   Do you want your bus driver or pilot flying stoned when your own safety is in their hands ? Sadly , pot supporters would scream sure , no problem man."

You may prefer not to hear the bad news that we have a ""progressive"" mayor who would act  so badly, because ""deaf"" is _such_ a ""hostile"" term.

One consequence is that it undermines the idea that the individual is saved from sin. If I am responsible for all the sins of my (human) race,  one wonders if I can ever be forgiven.

Ho Chi Minh was an open admirer of Thomas Jefferson, and Truman had promised self-determination for all people... except when they chose the wrong form of economy, and he decided France needed Vietnam's resources to rebuild after WW2.

So this was a group we talked about in the past. Very, very, very right-wing on foreign policy, what they called a muscular foreign policy, which was a euphemism for invading places. And very, very tough on crime—this was that era of mass incarceration that Bill Clinton pushed, and it's when Hillary was talking about black ‘superpredators,’ this myth, this so dangerous myth.”

Black added: “And on the economic side, they were all in favor of austerity. All in favor of privatization. Tried to do a deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security. And of course, were all in favor of things like NAFTA.”

Civil Beat.  (oxymoronic if you ask me, but that's all the voices in my head saying that)  They think I am inputting data from the conversation, like taking notes in school.  I'm actually typing during certain parts of the conversation (like now) to try and throw their train of thought off target.  So just now I typed that last sentence twice, by typing it and backspacing loudly, then retyping it faster so they think I'm following along w/ the conversation.  Fun times."
"So are your lectors going to form a special class that will demand that the Church allow them to stay in the sanctuary?  Or will they leave or refuse to read because they have been denied a special right?

The whole progressive movement is grounded in labeling people and demanding special privileges for those that are different in a well-intentioned effort to unify.  But when people are labeled and singled out for special attention, that is de facto divisive (that's why ""diversity"" efforts are misguided).  

Blacks should have no beef with the Church; the Church has no duty to make a special effort in their political causes.  People with same-sex attraction, at least, have a legitimate beef in that the Church expressly disapproves of their chosen use of their sex organs.  But when your core teaching revolves around male-female, procreation, parents raising their children, and the like, it's for the person to change not the Church."

"I understand the DM narrative is that all farmers is racist - even a small dairy farmer in the Swiss Alps. But please
"" it has been unable to protect them from neighbourhood racists."" Without balanced reporting this may just be someone enforcing a legal right to water, water reticulation or land legally purchased.
Example.
We bought a water right from our local scheme for a few R100,000. But we do allow some of the community to collect water and wash laundry in the canal. These people live on a plot owned by a black man - and he does not provide any water for all the tenants, but collects the rent. Yes the fountain belongs to the people (viva communism), but only some of the people maintains the infrastructure to get the water 3km closer. We can charge them money, because we are racist farmers you know. But we do not."
"Your wording suggests you may not be as COLOR BLIND as you claim. When you are with your many educated black friends, do you refer to individual ones as ""a black?"" What if ""a black"" does not get educated or talk like everyone else, what then?"
"Actually, speaking the truth as God has compelled me to do so in this church & state clearly how this bias against women is definitely hatred & not something else more comfortably spoken has indeed been the thing which has helped me to regain peace that I felt I didn't have.  It was when I was silent in the face of this terrible sin being done to me and all women that I had no peace.  Do you believe MLK Jr. was just some super distressed black guy, or a prophet God sent out to change the world?

Calling sin out for what it is helps and cures the damage.  Hiding sin or supporting it thru silence and cooperation is what does the damage.  

When I said do nothing against this sin, I was clear that I meant until people act & fight for change they become responsible for the sin and harm remaining in our church.  

God calls prophets not just to tell the future for God's people but to point out their sins which are angering God so that they repent and change and can heal as a body."
I wasn't aware one was running. Is it one of the libertarians? Is there a black panther candidate running this year?
Gun control is a very difficult situation in the USA. 350 million guns and if you round up guns it will just be the bad guys with the guns. There should be curbs on certain guns. So far seems like this latest idiot didn't have a record or a nut so hard to know what to do. How he got that many guns in hotel is also bizarre. LV has a lot of security. Strong gun laws on Chicago and last year 760 murdered for a record. Vast majority black on black killings.
"I'm well aware. In the 1990s, during the Oslo Peace accords, most Israelis bought into the premise of a new world order that accepted them irreversibly as part and parcel of the west. 
When the media campaign of lies began in Oct. 2000, the Israelis were so caught off guard at both the severity and malice and they just weren't prepared to respond to that kind of slander and choreographed propaganda. They wanted to be like Canada and the USA who apologize constantly to Natives and Blacks etc and everything will be OK and they just didn't have a good narrative prepared for themselves; they didn't expect to need it!
Hopefully they will have reckoned with the facts and moved past shallow western constructs into something more genuine.
The lefty agenda bears much of the blame."
"Ordination as WE know it today had its Roots in the times of Constantine.
The Male Clergy of the Catholic church [the ONLY  Christian organization in town] took on the Roles of Elite Rulers. They even took a lot of the robes and hats to show the various status groups. Even had certain chairs they sat in while at church.
Pious Women were URGED by the Men to enter Castles and pray, if they wanted a REAL part in Church. They were also clothed in black from head to toes, to wrists with only faces and hands showing. The MEN had the keys and locked them in and called the places Convents.
Pious Women in N. Italy, Central Europe were chased from place to place because they were unauthorized Female preachers [not men]. We still have some of their writings.
What I am trying to say is that Ordination as WE SDA's know it has its roots in OUR Catholic ancestors through Anglicans, Lutherans, Baptists, Methodists [Ellen and others], Presbys.
It has NO Biblical ROOTS."

"Trump asked about the left wing hate groups like BLM, antifa, Occupy Wall Street - all funded, organized, violent left-wing hate groups.  Democrats have been hiding behind the mob since they lost the civil war.  They organized new ones in recent years - same techniques, same people, new names.

Charlottesville would never have happened if the black vice mayor had not decided to pick a fight by removing a statue.  It would never have happened if democrat VA governor McAulliffe and the mayor had not told law enforcement to stand down.  The entire event is similar to Trump campaign events last year where democrat mayors told local law enforcement to stand aside and allow democrat rent-a-mobs to attack and beat Trump supporters leaving his rallies.  San Jose was one such example.

Senator Begich seems just fine with mob violence, as long as it is his guys doing it.  Be careful what you wish for, Senator.  Cheers -"

"I'd have been happier had Mr. Pitts told the truth about targeting black voters, but then hadn't tried to 'soften' it by saying it real target was Democrats.  I'm old enough to remember when it was the Democrats targeting--and lynching--black voters.  Perhaps my memory is a little longer than Mr. Pitts'.  If the last election didn't demonstrate the utter lack of difference between the two erstwhile (ersatz) ""parties"", what will?

But as much as I've liked some of Pitts' past editorials, his job probably rides on his not drawing too much attention to that fact: ""the purpose of the President is not to wield power, but to draw attention away from it."" (Douglas Adams--""Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"")"

Add the riff between  Police, FBI/AG's,  the Prosecutor's office, and the State Attorney General going after national issues, perfect environment to breed a street war between groups to control gambling, prostitution, drugs, and protection. Notice there has been an increase in shootings by afro -Americans here in Honolulu revolving around the above......that's because they are not influenced by the ""local"" way. They are the perfect soldiers, no background here, hide in the Waikiki jungle....and ""you picking on me cause I'm black."""

"Race problems are solved by repealing punitive drug laws designed to keep black men from voting, poverty programs that prohibit work but do not provide adequate housing, food or cash. Not enforcing laws which allow the formation of unions or which prohibit racism in hiring. There is government failure, but that failure is not due to the liberal impulse but to conservative resistence and racism."
"Yes, the case has been referred.  Strongly agree that boat driver's religious affiliation should be legally irrelevant. Thought authorities were investigating a possible crime, not an accident.

"Very short article, but missing some very key pieces of data.  It claims the racism is systemic, but it doesn't explain which systems.  There's no target. it's a ghost-hunt. Which institutions, policies or laws are racist? How can a problem be corrected if it isn't properly identified? This matters. If a patient complains of chest pains, applying the treatment for a heart attack won't do much good if they're suffering from broken ribs instead.

""The 21-page document also says participants noted African Nova Scotians continue to be over-represented in the child welfare and correctional systems, and black children are suspended at disproportionate rates.""

That, in and of itself, is not grounds for charges of racism. Why has this happened? Disproportionate rates occur for a lot of reasons that aren't necessarily racism. Women are a disproportionately high percentage of patients for gynaecologists. That's not because of discrimination."

"The 49ers should have cut him. He is merely trying to keep his name alive before he is cast as one of the biggest flops in the NFL. If he was serious, he would spend some of his ""oppressed millions"" to help the people he is supposedly taking a stand for. 

I believe the some of the race oppression issues exist. The black community is in a cycle the keeps them oppressed. I know people that have broken that cycle through hard work and determination to better themselves, but as a community as a whole, the are stuck in the environment they created.

If CK is serious about this, spend your money to help improve the education of the black communities. The way our system is setup, these schools get the least funding. This does need to be fixed. But remember, it comes down to choices. I know several black people that made the choice to do right and better themselves and they are extremely successful. If you choose not to, you are merely perpetuating the system. Its called self-responsibility."

Is it any wonder that this same moral code allows DEMOCRATS to support AND promote partial “birth” baby murder by the millions so that the black population can be kept in check?  Is it really a surprise that the only surviving political party left on Earth that supported slavery now actively supports infanticide, genocide and the violence necessary to carry it out?"

A Jewish woman reporter wrote an article about Melania, and was threatened with rape and murder. Her five year old daughter was also threatened with rape!

"Agirl:  I suggest you read the accounts from those persons at the party.  Absolutely no one asserts that Ms Shurtz was being intentionally insulting or mocking African Americans.  In fact the overwhelming majority of letters to the editor addressing this issue run very parallel to my feelings.....Mr Shurtz was attempting to honor Dr. Tweedy and used poor judgment by donning black make-up.  I use the term ""black make-up"" instead of ""blackface"" because the latter term implies racism and the mocking of African Americans with intent.  Again, no one asserts, (even in the ""so-called"" investigation) that such was Ms. Shurtz's intent.  

Photo:  Would you suggest Ms. Shurtz should have shaved her head to portray Dr. Tweedy?  

I'm not sure of the point of your post.  Do you suggest that Ms. Shurtz deserves to be dismissed from the University?  Do you feel the resign/be dismissed punishment the petitioners desire is appropriate?  Those are two questions for you.....thanks for answering them."

"Of course it is about money for the NFL owners you dimwitted idiot! And soon it is going to be about money for the players when the networks slash the money they are paying to the league. How long do you think the average Joe would be employed if he walked around at his job fist in the air bellyaching to customers about social injustice? I think what 87% of America is learning is that blacks are never going to be happy. They can be making millions playing sports, making violent angry noise or as President and they are going to be obsessed with police doing their jobs. Instead of questioning why 13% of the population commits over half of murders they focus on a tiny handful of police shootings. The ten or so clearly unjustified police shootings of blacks each year hardly is indicative of a major problem. The millions of crimes committed each year by blacks is. The 72% of black children born out of wedlock is. There is your social injustice Brandon."
Not saying otherwise.  But that's a difficult position to take when the descendants of the original inhabitants are being exempted from inclusion.  A seldom-mentioned fact in today's press is that Native folks are being killed by cops in even greater per capita numbers than black folks.  And that's WITHOUT including Latin-American folks (who are for the most part another branch of Native folks by ancestry).
"Exactly.  The #1 performer in the S&P is the Financial sector - Banks.  And why are they doing well?

Also your account of Kennedy's verbal interactions with his generals is 'Liberal' hearsay, how much is actually the full truth?  I read a French account by an ex diplomat (forget his name and the book) involved in the Cuban crisis and his firm opinion was that Kennedy and the US, who played draughts while the Russians played chess, were very much out negotiated. Two big concessions the Russians got was (secret) removal of US missiles from Turkey and an agreement to never invade Cuba. The latter was crucial as it allowed the Russians to fund/send Cuban military and political activists all over the 2nd/3rd world without the US being able to do anything to stop it."
"Here's a photo that I would like made into a statue.   https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/slavery_scars.jpg   

This is history.   This is actually far more representative of the history of the south than the absurdity of creating monuments to people who started a civil war to keep slavery legal.  Slavery was already more than 200 years old when the war began.   It continued another 100 years to a great degree through legal segregation under Jim Crow laws.  Do we need photos of what the south looked like under Jim Crow?   There were more than 4,000 lynchings of southern blacks from the beginning of the 20th century through the 50s, some people say 20,000, until Emmett Till.   Maybe a statue of Emmett Till in his open casket would make a good statue.  I like it.  

Those confederate monuments were part of Jim Crow intimidation of black people, who were repeatedly murdered, tortured, burned out and robbed for 100 years.   Our proud history."
"Wrong. Land ownership and prosperity are not directly linked. Study this list and note how many prosperous countries have relatively low levels of home ownership: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

What IS directly linked is national prosperity and the legal protection of all private property (including intellectual property). Your racist, outdated ideologies will INCREASE suffering and deprivation.

If you want to increase home and land ownership among black people, give title deeds to the 18 million people living under traditional leadership. The real question is: why haven't you done this yet? If the ANC genuinely cared about poor black people, you would have done this within your first five years in power."
"Good question. Let me get on the big black party line and ask. 

""Sarah, get me all black people in North Carolina on the party line please.""

Probably something to do with how all of black Americans are on welfare and are paid to vote  for Democrats, right? Except for North Carolina, for some reason because the welfare system missed a couple of ""vote Democratic"" welfare payments in that state so NC blacks retaliated. Is that what you're looking for?

You guys are your own worst enemy. People vote AGAINST your party because of your party's obvious racism. The only people surprised to hear people think Republicans are racist are people who defend the Republican party by making racist statements."
"I think we all agree more details need to emerge before anything beyond sheer speculation can be made.

I do know, however, that as a general rule, we should be extremely cautious with any object that can inflict injury when interacting with police officers.  Tragedies have occurred when police have called out to a person, and in a split-second decision, shot that person when faced with a weapon.  Why?  Because there is an instinctive (or natural) tendency to respond to a command or verbal challenge by turning to face it.  If a person happens to be holding a gun, or in this case a crossbow, then the natural reaction is to turn to the source of the challenge while still holding whatever it is that's being held.

It happens in police-on-police shootings too.  After a notorious incident some years ago, it was advised that if you happen to be a black officer in plain clothes, that it would be unwise to engage in a foot pursuit holding your gun if uniformed officers may suddenly intervene."

why do i have a sneaking suspicion you felt the same way about that whole ""civil rights"" BS in the mid sixties?

"""... neither of them strong-armed her into ignoring Wisconsin or taking Michigan for granted.""

    Indeed. Speaking of Michigan, it's appalling that Michiganers voted Republican.
  After revelations that Republican Governor Snyder had poisoned the water supply of the people of Flint, Michigan, predominantly African-American,  for profit,  decent, ethical, democratic people would have threw the bum out. But, instead, not only did Michiganers vote in Snyder again but, contrary to tradition, voted for Republican Trump.

Neither Vlad Putin, nor the FBI, nor Donald Trump did anything to undermine American democracy.

"My, my! It is shameful that Boyden's biggest defenders in this discussion are Sun Media (which has compared this to the birther conspiracy) and people who say racist things like ""You are so deluded by clinging to your ancestry.""

Boyden has claimed numerous variations on indigenous ancestry, but he's never been specific. He's hinted that his Uncle Erl really was indigenous, but how was that? His defenders have suggested it's hard to trace one's ancestors, but we don't know if that's true of Boyden's family tree. He's not telling.

And did he get his gig in New Orleans by saying he had Nipmuc blood and therefore didn't need a Green Card? One wonders. Playing Indian is a common theme in American lit. There are lots of examples. It sure ain't easy to pretend to be Black to get ahead. Unless you're Mindy Kaling's brother."
"19,000/32,000 gun deaths in the US were suicides.  Where are most suicides?  In Asia and Eastern Europe.  Most common method?  Hanging.  They should outlaw ropes.

Most civilized people do not like guns.  We don't like bombs either, but thank God the US has them.  Why?  Because if the bad guys have all the bombs....  Same deal with guns.

Most gun homicides in the US are about personal conflicts, not the mere ownership of a gun.  The majority of homicides with guns in the US are committed by Black people killing other Black people.  That's sheer numbers, not rates per person.  Considering that Blacks make up about 13% of the population, maybe we need to be focusing on something else, not the guns."

"Who knew the Globe was a staunch defender of the KKK's rights. After all, the KKK cloak represents religious purity, prejudice against homosexuals, anti-semitism - and so does the niqab, all over the world, without exception.  But the niqab means feminism and modesty in Canada (just Canada). I'm still waiting for the Globe's piece in the Life section with three Klansmen pushing their kids on swings in the park - they just wear the cloak for modesty and to represent their faith, nothing to do with support of violence towards homosexuals and Jews... does this sound ridiculous, because it is  - let's defend a symbol that is synonymous with violence against homosexuals - as the niqab is most common in countries that punish homosexuality with jail or worse (often the death penalty). But in Canada it means modesty and independence - the niqab's supporters are pathetic. Let's encourage a symbol that is only common in countries where women are treated like second class citizens..."
"Hopefully, they mention the true history of the KKK here, the sundowner laws, and how we were the only state admitted into the union with racial disparaging language - specifically banning any ‘free negro, mulatto, not residing in this state at the time’ from living holding real estate and making any contracts within the state.”  But, I guess it always easiest to ignore those facts...
And, then there's the more recent Eugene history...murders, rapes, robberies, property crime, and graffiti...ah, but then again, it's easier to ignore those too..."
I hope no officers sign up for any duty related to Pride this year. Maybe they should make them pay for their own security through a private company.

"Trump has NOTHING to do with it. Talk about over reaching. Clinton was POTUS during OJ's murder trial, and the predominantly black jury let him off the hook.

We allow the Pentagon and CIA and NSA etc... to outsource illegal terrorist activities like those committed at black sites by contractors? We allow every right to be conditionally administered by what then can only be rightly called our master. How can we have corrupt politician that nobody likes after corrupt politician that nobody likes who constantly bend the law until it breaks only to rewrite it for their own purposes and yet turn to the little guy and tell him to straighten up and fall in line, rule of law and all that?

The first generation to come over, in both cases, tended to stick with many of the ""old country"" beliefs, values and lifestyle.  My wife's parents stayed with the Christian Reformed Church, sent their kids to Christian Reformed schools, ate Dutch food and made trips back ""home"".  In the Italian community, the elderly women wore black head to toe and covered their heads with shawls.  The children, however, ended up as Canadian as hockey pucks.  This ""they won't integrate"" routing is old and tired."

Second premise: We don't want to do those things.

"Reducing the speed limit and shortening passing lanes (as ODOT did recently) do not reduce the accidents.  What they really do is increase the dangerous passing and road rage.  Having driven from Eugene to Florence weekly for work I can tell you that inconsiderate drivers who refuse to pull to the side to let faster traffic pass are are huge problem.  I asked a deputy once on KPNW's Wake up Call, why they don't enforce the ""obstructing the flow of traffic"" law.  His answer, ""because the person passing unsafely gets a bigger ticket"".  He acknowledged the road rage this causes and said it leads to reckless driving which is a much larger fine.  Hwy 38 from Scottsburg to I-5 is much safer because there are so many passing lanes that the 80 mph big pick up's blowing black smoke can safely pass.  16 would be much safer had Kitty and her litter mates not shut down the ""West Eugene Parkway""."

May Roof be murdered nine times after arriving in hell, and then shunned as a pariah therein for eternity--just as his victims were maltreated as if they were less than human all their lives under Jim Crow terror and tyranny, and thereafter had to watch helplessly as their youth were gunned down by both criminals and the cops who were supposed to protect them, until finally being murdered themselves.

Were it up to me, Roof would be stripped naked, plastered with hog-slop, kneecapped then thrown into a pit full of starving pigs.  And I say this knowing that to torture mortals is hara'am (Islamically unlawful).  Lannatullahi alayhi alf mura'at."

Thank God, our work was rewarded by complete success. After the order grew to large numbers, we found it was necessary to have someone of large experience to command. We chose General N. B. Forrest, who had joined our number. He was made a member and took the oath in the Room No. 10 of the Maxwell House at Nashville, Tennessee, in the fall of 1866, nearly a year after we organized at Pulaski. The oath was administered to him by Captain John W. Morton, afterwards Secretary of State, Nashville, Tennessee.[9]""

My first actual encounter with a black person was as a 5 year old seeing a black porter on the CP line as we journeyed across Canada to our new home in Alberta.  I somewhat overcome my fear given the character and humour of this individual and how he treated children like me, on the train.
Regardless of how you feel about the niqab ban, I feel this is a teaching moment.  There's a person inside that niqab who breathes and feels not a lot different from you or me, and who might also have very young children at home, just like this child, and this is what the child should be taught.  Love conquers fear, and the sooner we begin with that, the better, IMO."

So by kneeling, regardless of their purpose, it is taken as a slight to the country and those who sacrificed.
#2) It seems to me that they are protesting the RESULT of the problem rather than the ROOT of the problem.  They complain that police are unfairly targeting blacks.  Why?  It could have to do with the fact that blacks only make up 15% of the population in the US but commit over 50% of the crime.  That is an absolutely staggering statistic.  It's human nature to profile when the numbers are that overwhelming.  The ROOT of the problem lies in black neighborhoods where the education system is horrible and jobs are scarce.

I have lived and worked in every region of the US, and though Oregon has considerable racial diversity, it has few black people compared to almost everywhere except Alaska. I also agree that housing is too expensive in Oregon, and in that regard California is worse.

But the point I was making is that the West and East Coasts export a surplus of money, and that the South and the flyover states get that surplus, thus are welfare states overall. Considering that, it would be painfully ironic if the federal government refused to return funds that originated primarily in the productive states that subsidize the rest of the country.

"Simple. If you want a service oriented economy, then diversity is a strength (think Silicon Valley or Hollywood - if it was unicultural, they wouldn't be as successful. Hollywood has had great success with Jewish, Black, Asian, Latino and other cultures represented in it. If they insisted only on WASPs, then they wouldn't have been an national or international success. Ditto for the Silicon Valley).

If you want to be purely a manufacturing country (think China or Japan) then multiculturalism is a weakness. Come to think of it, even in the military sphere, multicultural countries like the USA, Russia, the British EMpire, etc have been more successful than uni-cultural ones like Germany, Japan, China, etc"
"Sorry, but it the conservatives who are afraid of their shadows.  Afraid of women, afraid of black men, afraid of people with jobs, afraid of people whose sexuality isn't like theirs, afraid of immigrants, etc. etc.

Boo!"
"I an appreciate that it had nothing to do with the military - but that's the point. He decried, as you quoted, ""... a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color"" - it's that flag of ""oppression"" that gave him the ability to make such a protest without government sanction - many many places in the world he would've been imprisoned yet he, in his 'oppressed' state, has the freedom to do what he did... AND whether he likes it or not - it is the US military that fights for that flag and his 'oppressed' self to have that freedom.

Are there inequalities? Yes... we've made progress (haven't seen an auction block for slaves - have you?) - are we where we need to be? No.

I have no problem with what Kap is trying to communicate - I disagree with him on how he went about it."
"Welfare (as designed by congressional Democrats) has destroyed millions of Black American families. Which their own Patrick Moynihan told them it would do. Coming from a fatherless home is the number one predictor of juvenile delinquency. Hundreds of (Democrat controlled for 50 years) inner cities are plagued by crime, drugs, and the worst schools in the country. American taxpayers have spent more than 20 trillion dollars on welfare since the War on Poverty began. And if anything, our inner cities are more troubled and inner city residents are more poorly educated than previously. Welfare should be workfare for able bodied adults. Anything else is a continual insult to the recipients. Norway, while having a high per capita wealth, has an astonishingly high cost of living. Norway also utilizes its energy resources for wealth. Norway also has healthy young nicely dressed adults shamelessly sitting on sidewalks begging for money. I don't want that for my descendants."

"I didn't take her to be trashing the Gates foundation. I thought her primary criticism was of the disparity between the supports available to wealthier women, to have whatever families they like on whatever terms they like, and the resources available to poor women. She points out how the deck is stacked against the poor, and particularly women of color.  I didn't get that she thought they shouldn't have access to birth control. Rather, it seemed that she thought they should have access to humane employment, child care, health care, housing, educational opportunities, and the whole range of social goods that women of greater means enjoy, as they build and nurture their own families. Access to birth control alone is insufficient. The idea that the greatest impediment to the well-being of the poor is their own fertility is a falsehood that lets the privileged off the hook. There is a lot more than birth control that everyone should have access to. At least, that's how I read it."

It's funny how character, morals, the things a person says, the views a person has seemed to matter so much just a short time ago! It seems it didn't take much to jettison these ideals from the minds of religious and conservative voters. Racist things Trump has said are easy to find:

Publication wasn't a big deal, just a small notification that ran in some obscure local paper for a week or two. Do people actually read those kinds of notices? Of course, I had to inform my insurance company and a host of other notifications. Yeah, it's a nuisance more than financial burden, but why is your daughter more special than mine or more special than anybody else who has to go through it?

These players are a joke . The very fact they have high paying jobs just to play a game shows America is a country that gives everyone a chance to be the best they can be and is a country to be proud of .  Since they have the right to take a knee---does that mean I have the right to use the N word any time I want ?  I'd never do that since it would be disrespectful to them---just as they are being disrespectful of the very country that puts the food on they're table .   The NFL has clear cut rules that tells the players they must stand while they are on the job . The second they enter the arena they are on the clock . Why doesn't the NFL enforce it's own clear cut rules ?   I'm one of those who will change the channel when games come on until these over paid players stop disrespecting America .  And in other news---last week footage was shown of a youth football team made up of about 10 years old's . The kids took a knee .  What are the odds they're black coaches were behind it ?

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives. Statistics and facts. Just like when you say that black on black crime is what kills the most you are called a racist. As long as we allow the political class ( two wings on the same vulture) divide us we have no chance. United we stand.

"Musician Ted Nugent said... that Trump was not unambiguous in his remarks.

“We condemn all violence. That’s what President Trump said. And all lives matter. If you don’t agree with that you’re a racist,” he said.

This position is of course entirely correct. In terms of accuracy, succinctness, spirit and intent, righteousness and morality...

But these fundamentals of course will never do for the left, in terms of actual substance- only in terms of mindless form and blathering. Their newest bobble-headed buzz phrase is ""false equivalence"": translation- ""our thugs are better than theirs"". These hapless progressive boobs see no difference, for example, between the unfortunate embracing of an organization founded by Margaret Sanger and one founded by Adolph Hitler. Look up ""eugenics""- especially as applied to black people. False equivalence indeed. Being low-information individuals is bad enough. Being no-information- and no real principles of integrity- can only lead us to disaster."

"Using that logic, if banning women (or even blacks or gays) from serving as combat troops was ""good enough"" for the first several hundred years the United States existed, then it should be fine if we return to that status.  Dont you think?

"To what extent do we live in a free country?  To what extent should we control the actions of individuals when those actions have no direct or significant affect on others except in their minds.  Those who would restrict smoking resort to the notion that second-hand smoke comprises a direct and significant threat to their bodies.  In many cases, this is nonsense, but the drive to control is legitimized by a direct and significant physical effect.  In the case of a person applying black make-up, the only adverse effect is admitted to stem from the minds of others.  Kinda like the Spanish Inquisition where people were burned at the stake for wrong thinking.  Racism only has meaning when it translates into action.  When folks throw around racism accusations without without actions of direct and significant consequence (based on intrinsic effect not interpreted effect), they only project their worldview.  It is important to distinguish the real from the presumed."

"The Canadian Jewish Congress and others were attacking a number of things: freedom of speech, legal rights and common decency.

The event was a memorial for Barbara Kulaszka, who passed away a month ago. As a lawyer she defended some far-right Canadians on free speech matters. As far as I know, her views and speech have never been at issue. By attempting to shut down this memorial, its critics aren't attacking hate speech, they're attacking someone's ability to speak about a deceased person. The critics are likewise attacking the legal right to be represented by a lawyer, because the condemnation has a chilling effect on the ability of an accused to get legal representation. And then finally, the critics are attacking common decency. It was a memorial, not a neo-Nazi Holocaust-denying free for all.

Like it or not, Ms. Kulaszka defended free speech and individuals other lawyers wouldn't touch. The CJC et al acted poorly in trying to stop her memorial."

"Still, no one can tell me how protesting the national anthem has anything to do with police picking on black people...which in and of itself is a spurious claim at best.  Are there individual racist cops that have done inappropriate things?  Of course.  And when/if they do act in a racist manner, they should be (and are) punished appropriately.  Is there a systemic based racism in all cops.  Nope.  But again I'll ask, can anyone explain to me how kneeling for our national anthem is somehow related to cops?  And is it really a wise way to protest cops when the correlation between cops and our national flag is extremely weak and most people know it will be taken as an affront to the military?"

Black Lives Matter is about cops killing unarmed African-Americans for no justified reason, not the other way around. Anyone casual reader of the news can see that. Only those who tolerate unequal treatment and taking away civil liberties support Trump. We didn't fight wars so people could stand for the national anthem. They were fought to preserve democracy and the constitutional right to protest against government policy.

But basically you are attacking those fighting state capture because you believe they are not doing it the intellectual way. The reality is that colonialism happened and apartheid happened.

 This nonsense is no different than Eugene. junior is doing drugs in a public park where children are, including his dirty needles...police are called, show up, Junior fights the cops, cops fight back doing their job...and the lunatic left protests police brutality. If Junior happens to be black, omfg, RACISM!!!! 
 Take a glass of clean water, add a couple of drops of poison. Doesn't matter how much clean water was in that glass, drink it, you're getting ill. In this case we have a glass of dysfunctional poison with a couple of drops of truth. Point being; this isn't doing a damn thing to change the perceived problem, it's adding to the dysfunction."
"This article highlighted the unpublisised and unacceptable  violence happening to fellow South Africans, an outcry for help!!! I also aggree that the old South African flag belongs in the past and evokes unneseccary hatred and devide, even amongst farmers. Its time that we stand together as fellow South Africans and stop propagating race or colour. Many political partries thrive on spreading devide through race and colour sepratism. Fellow South Africa, I hear your pain about the flats and fellow South African, I hear your pain about murders on farms. Lets propagate unity through our speach and action in our beloved country."
"He and I mention it as proof positive the media is dishonest.  Even Fox's Chris Wallace got in on the dishonesty today----comparing a photo of Obama's crowd and comparing it to the crowd before everyone arrived.  On top of that , the Obama crowd wasn't an indication of how good the president was that just got elected.   Perhaps 70 percent of D.C. is black , and 98 percent of blacks voted for Obama.  Was there any doubt they'd walk blocks to show up ?   Trump won by punching people in the chops who dissed him.  That's how he'll make America great again.  Take the blinds off and you might see that."
"Jesus didn't come for the 'sinless' but for the sinners.  Christians can sin as much as anybody else.
Sadly, it is the official church which made 'sexual expression' a worse sin than:
1) cold-blooded murder
2) extortion/black-mail 
3) nuclear proliferation
4) an authoritative corruption by officials---church & state"
"I've found that people who deflect police brutality by talking about Chicago murders are racists.  ""Why are they complaining about cops killing unarmed blacks when their own are killing more!  You straighten out that Chicago problem and then we'll tell our cops to stop killing unarmed blacks""."

Black wives matter.  Wait.  That's not Woods.  It's black lives matter.  Yes.  Let's go with prejudicial law enforcement or clinical mitigation so that we can get back to golf entertainment.
"Beyonce Knowles despite her middle class upbringing and great  wealth, is not classified as privileged. She  will never be expected to denounce her luxurious lifestyle in any meaningful way only because she is black."
Blacks are killing blacks at record numbers vs. crime against blacks by other races. This is all BS because blacks refuse to take responsibility for their own savagery.
"I sat in my conservative evangelical church, maybe the last person to move from a pew.  This was within the week that President Bush announced the attack on Iraq.    I had thought it a silly rumor, not possible, but there it was.

I sat crying until the pastor saw me and asked if I was OK.  I wasn't.  I saw the deaths of thousands about to happen for what reason? It was as obvious to me it was a 'murder for oil' plan.  

The US could care less, (much like we do with the majority of South America and Africa), about the Muslim poor in the Middle East or the atrocities of Saddam. (We certainly ignored genocide in Africa more than once).   Nope, the heart of American foreign policy has always been a locked safe full of gold and it takes Oil to keep it filled.

It's hypocritical for me to blame American foreign policy for abuse, when all Americans, have enjoyed the financial rewards of stripping natural resources from other nations.  I plead guilty of trusting The Party."
"Yes, Social stratification by wealth is color-less.  Some people of color who I have met are totally the most uppity when they have bucks.  ""Oh. My God, look at that girl, she's country""  In many brown nations, the darker you are the less you have social status.  I have seen examples in my travels.  The elites in these countries think that it is normal to use and abuse the average person.  Many in the 3rd world are conditioned to think they are ""less"" that the elites.  If you are American and have not traveled, you cannot fathom the difference between here and there."
"Like you, I'm not African-American either, Richard. But I grew up in the South during a time when racism was institutionalized and have a good idea how corrosive it can be. Walk a mile in someone else's shoes before you pronounce judgment."
"I highly doubt Mr. Leavings  has ever read the Qur'an  or any book on Islam not put out by the ""Muslims are here to kill us"" cottage industry.  Muslims are a  religious group not a homogenous ethnic unit.  The single largest group of Muslims in America are African-Americans at 35%,  where would you send them off to?   As if this  needed saying  muslims have sworn allegiance to this country (and yes, even on the  Qur'an)  beginning with the Civil War.  The first person of a culturally Muslim background arrived in Eugene just over 100 years ago,  selling tamales from a horse drawn cart down Willamette Street  he later operated a wholesale poultry and egg business  for 50 years on the present site of the Hilton. 
 The causes  of terrorism are  complex; mostly relating to poverty and oppression by authoritarian governments (often backed by the US) repression breeds  extremism in certain kinds of people. Its not like misguided people have never acted in the name of Christianity."

"It wasn't the fault of the OSC. Several prominent Americans of high net worth exposed Home Capital Group and with mounting evidence the OSC had no choice otherwise. Much the same happened with Conrad Black as we recall, the Americans exposed him as Canada tried their best to keep it all hush, hush."
It also smacks of racism. It paints a picture of  a black man Needing an escort to safely navigate the area and ensure his safety from all of those kids. Ridiculous.
"I agree with your thoughts here, sorta.  I think you are half right, but the fact that he said it deserves every bit of condemnation that he received by all of the blacks he had on his show.  They did not agree with what he said at all.  They pretty much nailed him as they should.  Doubly so because he nails the conservatives that screw up without question, and with glee.  What goes around, comes around. He violated his own ""PC"" rules, so he should get burned by it.  You can't say the ""House-N"" word without it being racist. There is no rationale that can be permitted on this term.  You know that, you are a smart guy, and I know you do.  It is not self-effacing in any way.  In fact I find that word hard to attach to his remark.  He used the word to get his laugh, at THEIR expense.  So that is why he had to crawl back to them on his show.  He deseved everything that he got, because he calls people all kinds of derogatory names on his show.  I give him no quarter here.  He blew it, 100%."

"DISTASTEFUL...that's it...DISTASTEFUL...what is he serving, sour milk?  A human being who thrives on BULLYING is distasteful.  Tell that to the thousand of children, women, employees who are bullied each and every day...no worries...its just distasteful?  Good God, the future president of the USA is a mysogynistic, homophobic, racist, sexist dim wit!  He has the temperament of a 2 year old with a fever and runny nose.  So thin skinned you can see through it!  But distasteful...come on, even a grade 2 student would have a better adjective to describe this pompous ass!"
Do you have to ask?  Don't you think there are people who think the whole response to Colin K is because he is black?  That his inability to keep his starting job has nothing to do with anything?
I guess all the people who stood against slavery were interested only in dominating  and controlling Black families at the time as well.  I don't care what Trump's personal belief on abortion is as long as he backs up what he promised during the election.
"and the corruption continues. caldwell, the city council, and hart continue Hawaii's people paying taxes and fees in to the black hole named ""rail"". caldwell, the city council, and hart are spending monies with no accountability because they feel that the budget is unlimited. i do not see the people of Hawaii spending monies on their own projects that way. the rest of the people have to spend with in the budget that they have. but no, caldwell, the city council and hart follow different rules. How come there are no consequences? what a bunch of greedy, lying cowards these politicians are. WHY DON'T YOU TAKE A POLL to see how sick and tired the people are of this way, way, way over budgeted monster called rail is."
"Key to BIG LIE is the misuse of the word ""disproportionately""

"Taking Doug Card's point a step further, how would an African American student in her class ever feel secure that she could understand and fairly evaluate the student's work? Even if we accept her anti-racist motives as genuine (without knowing her, I'm willing to believe her), her inexplicably inappropriate choice would create an enormous barrier. On civil liberties and academic freedom grounds,I hope she's not fired, but I hope she looks for a dignified way to exit."
"Ok. This is why I said ""Wow!"" When you refer to ""them"" - are you talking about black people? Hispanic people? both? What problems in ""there"" communities are you talking about? Are you talking about street crime? Or housing and other forms of systemic discrimination that is largely out of the hands of the victims? Are you suggesting that Black and Hispanic people ""live and work for"" those problems or are to blame for those because we're not ""self-reliant and personally responsible?"" Are you suggesting that we don't want cops in ""our"" neighborhoods to protect us against street crime? I don't even know where to begin..."
"While gerrymandering is an ancient practice, it has been turned into an artform in recent times. the gerrymander in Wisconsin is so great that even in 2012,  a year where Obama won the state by 7 points, Republicans still won 60 seats. It favors Republicans by 14 points, which is a margin so large even a huge national Democratic wave wouldn't overcome it. Wisconsin isn't the only state to be greatly gerrymandered, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina are as well. In the South, party is historically tied to race, blacks almost always vote Democrat, thus any change to limit African American political power, by extension is also a change to limit Democratic political power.  The Voting rights Act requiring pre-clearance was a good idea, but it did not go far enough. it needed to address all states with a history of  denying minorities the right to vote. Wisconsin would have not qualified under the original rules, but its actions since 2010 mean it would qualify now. Gerrymanders need to go."
BLM was started when a Hispanic shot a Black?  Are Hispanics one of the peoples of color?
"Oh let me guess, black people right?"
"Response to Tim Osman --
 I was a staunch Bernie Sanders supporter. In February I wrote the following:
 ""It is more important to me to see a President such as Bernie Sanders, who truly cares about people.  Hillary Clinton was part of the 'you get two for one'; therefore, it is disingenuous for her to separate herself from Bill Clinton's  suppressive racist policies, such as 'ending welfare as we know it', support of the death penalty as well as a tremendous increase of Blackmen in the prison system for non-violent drug crimes...Yes, it would be simply wonderful to have a woman president, but clearly not Hillary. Someone more like Elizabeth Warren, a woman who truly cares about people and doesn't blow with the wind...The president needs to reflect what is in the best interest of America's citizens, not corporate America's interests.""

Once Hillary became the Democrat nominee there was no choice between this Centrist-Democrat and a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic fool.

"Jemele Hill revisited the Trump family history. Fred Trump had Donald seek ways to remove blacks from his apartment building. Anyone watching Donald placing blame ""on both sides"" in the Charlottesville mayhem would reach the conclusion Trump is bigoted."
"To attain a population for a district, Geography is pre-eminent. County lines, municipal boundaries and compactness are supposed to be the guiding lines.

A state that has 1 million people should get 2 congressional seats. If it votes 60% or 600,000 votes for one party, that party in theory should get both seats. However, if most of the majority party live in the one major city, which constitutes one of the two seats, then the state will send one representative  from each party.

No matter what you do, you cannot draw that state in such a way that you do no ""pack"" the urban voters together. A ""pie"" split of the city will not satisfy the compactness requirement, or the municipal/county line requirement.

Besides many urban districts are ""gerrymandered"" to ensure that Hispanic, or Black votes are not diluted. Chicago has several districts like that, and the Democrats were behind it."

And playing the race card isn't an argument. Go tell your neo-Marxist school teachers they failed to teach you basic reasoning.

Btw, you may want to consider why your standards are doubled based on race. In what situation would you allow people to smear an accused black person of guilt before proven innocent, without bothering to inquire of his side of the story? Yes, there is a racist here, indeed..."
"I understand the ACLU's point on this...but here is the other side. What if a skin head goes into a bakery with Jewish owners and asks for a cake for a birthday celebration at his home in honor of a certain German dictator. If he is turned away, can the skin head sue the bakery? Or if some ALT-Right guy goes into a bakery owned by a black-man and wants a cake with racially insensitive remarks on it? Does the black baker have to comply? Where does the line get drawn?

All Republicans have for black people are bullets. They have given Democrats a pretty low bar to get over to look less racist than Republicans.
"I think the point this article misses is it is not just words and ideas: given the opportunity, Nazis and their ilk WILL unleash a violent reign of terror that will dwarf what happened at that protest. Letting Nazis have a platform emboldens those who share their ideas to act violently, as we have seen so many times. 

Will punching an individual Nazi stop this? No. What will stop Nazis is determined mass resistance that will use whatever means necessary to stop such a vile, dangerous movement from taking hold. In the meantime, I have zero sympathy for Nazis who get punched, because guess what: given the opportunity, they'll punch a gay person, a person of colour, or political opponent, or worse."
"You seem to be confusing the issue with your Hobby Lobby example.  Hobby Lobby not selling ghosts and goblins is not the same as a cake artist who sells wedding cakes to straight couples, but not to gay couples.  What if he refused to sell wedding cakes to black couples?  Or mormon couples?  Or catholics?  Hobby Lobby isn't selling ghosts to *anyone* and so they aren't discriminating.  

This guy sells wedding cakes.  He should sell wedding cakes to anyone and everyone who walks into his store.  That's it."

"The British Black and Tans were comprised of veterans of Wirld War I. Not all had the personal and family resources to help them cope with life after a horrorific war. Many were causing trouble and the British government thought they had found a solution for them and ""the Catholic ""

Also there never arose a great advocate like Ghanaian out of Ireland. I always wondered though ""The Informer"" may partially explain why.
Nonviolence also needs to raise its head out of the sand and look and acknowledge and act on the root causes of racism and sexism in all areas and all groups of people.

"Anybody know why Melania didn't put on a Pussyhat and march with the women?

  Yes. Now the truth can be revealed.
   Melania isn't really Trump's wife. Trump has several secret wives stashed away in several Islamic countries.
 Melania is actually Trump's secret Minister of Propaganda. She's a front for the shadowy cabal of multinational billionaire oligarchs who have taken over the world with a master gender ideology.
    As the world knows, Trump hates women. He would never slow dance with a woman. But he dances slow dances with Melania because, as his Minister of Propaganda, he whispers to Trump what idiotic things he needs to say next.

"What do you know, another Democratic Party / Liberal false lying story designed to foster racism,division and anger as well as draw the ignorant to the Democratic Party.

As a Native it is a fact the same treatment is given Natives In Alaska and the lower 48.

Solutions:

1. Single payer healthcare to bring us up to par with countries results and cost per capita.
2. Tax the wealthy their fair share to reverse the cost-shifting onto the middle class that has happened for the past three decades, thus stimulating the economy by increasing aggregate demand.
3. Policies that allow wage earners to keep more of the profits from their labor, again, aggregate demand, and improvement of social problems that come with poverty.
4. Continue the historic deficit reduction that happened under Obama.
5. Invest in education and infrastructure.
6. Invest in occupational retraining for workers displaced by the new economy.
7. Reduce defense spending waste.
8. Enforce environmental protections so that companies can't cost-shift the effects of their production onto the public.

Just to name a few."
"Given the situation in the U.S. today, with Catholics such as Steve Bannon in leadership roles where they foster, or at least do not oppose, anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, anti-Jewish, anti-gay, anti-Black, anti-feminist sentiments and actions, this movie might be quite relevant."
"Indeed...at least before the absentee and military ballots are counted. :-)

But you're missing point.  She got the majority of black and Latino votes, no doubt.  But more Latinos voted for Trump then did for Romney.  She abandoned her middle class working Democrats....and many of them voted for Trump...just as she was warned.

Can you even begin to imagine what would have happened if a truly likable Republican was running against her?  You may want to recall the Reagan elections.  This is something the Democrats are going to have to assess - you cannot abandon your base and think they're going to stand by you."
"Citizens United and the destruction of the Voting Right Act. Scalia and the other conservatives on the Supreme court have done more to destroy our Democracy than perhaps even Trump will. Thanks to those two decisions Dark money now runs this country. Who even knows who is behind all that money that buys so many politicians in DC? And thanks to the destruction of the Voting Rights Act, the GOP has been set free to make voting almost impossible for the poor, people of color (those who vote Democrat). Let's not forget redistricting also! Wake up America! Our Democracy is under attack. If we can't vote and we can't follow the money than we are no longer living in a Democracy!"

"Mr. Harris, like Ms. Moultry, is specifically referring to Ms Shurtz and branding Ms Shurtz's portrayal of Dr. Tweedy as ""willfully ignorant and malicious.""  Those are both extreme descriptions and both phrases ascribe motivation to Ms. Shurtz.  If I believed Ms Shurtz was either one, I'd gladly seek out that petition demanding her resignation or dismissal and sign it myself.  Nothing in her thirty years as a respected professor suggests she's ""willfully ignorant"" about anything.  Did she show poor judgment with her ""black makeup"" in portraying Dr. Tweedy....Indeed, she did.  Was it ""malicious""mockery (as is ""blackface"")? IMO, no, it was part of a well-intentioned effort to honor Dr. Tweedy and promote others reading his book...an effort which went awry because of her using black make-up and doning an Afro wig in her portrayal.  She has issued a (again, IMO) heartfelt apology.

How about a little understanding, compassion and forgiveness. Then let' work together to make things better.."

Racism crosses age barriers, and always has.  So, again, being ageist is not helpful in ending bigotry, as it is also a form of bigotry."

"For a moment lets just look at what we know so far. Congresswoman Wilson, a Democrat from the district the young man grew up in that tragically lost his life, claim:
(1)  she recalls  overhearing Mr Trump more than once say ""I am sure he must have known what he signed up for""; 
(2) she admits not hearing the whole phone call;
(3) she has not recalled anything else publicly that she remembers from the phone call;

Subsequently she has gone on to claim this is ""Trump's Benghazi"" and the phone call a ""cover-up"" for mismanagement in Niger. 

Trump for his part has denied the recollection and claimed that she is misrepresenting the conversation. 

Sounds like classic politicking; but really in a week with some pretty significant Trump administration developments this is what BS/DM give us?

I think this mostly speaks for itself, especially to jump on this so quickly. The motivation here is confirmation bias and unfortunately why the DM US reporting is so poor and irrelevant."
"Haycox uses the term ""ownership"" and its cognates in three different senses, without differentiating among them.  So he compares oranges to apples to bananas and comes up with the fruity conclusion that the Tlingit lost ""their"" land with the Purchase.  

Aboriginal title did not imply possession of the land: Native Americans did not think any man had power to fix limits to the environment and were puzzled at the European belief that this was the only ""civilized"" way to live.  Imperial title was chiefly a matter of conquest, exploitation of the Native people, and defense of commercial interests against European encroachers.  Common-law title is what we are familiar with, and it is the sense that Haycox anachronistically projects backward to the situation in 1795, and then in 1867.  It's not possible to ""give back"" the Tlingit land in the common-law sense, for the aboriginal Tlingit themselves never defined it that way."

I wish the right was not only against free speech when it's a black person speaking up or taking a knee. The right only seems to be all in for free speech when it's a Nazi speaking. Remember protesting ones speech is not against that person's right of free speech.
"You are oversimplifying what is, yes, a complex issue.

What is happening in Asia and elsewhere is non-western cultures ""appropriating"" what they admire in western culture, adapting it to their tastes and needs, and leaving the rest.

And lots of immigrants to the west still listen to music from ""home"", still watch tv and movies from ""home"" , etc. . They prefer them to ""western"" music, tv, movies, etc., and thanks to cable and satellite and the Internet, it is a lot easier for them to stay immersed in that world than it was a few decades ago.

Did you know when early anthropologists and musicologists tested the reaction of Africans to jazz, they were shocked to find out Africans were puzzled by it, despite its African roots.

The tastes of people are largely based on what they are familiar with, and they will be attracted to things that are somewhat new, but not totally. Tastes in adults evolve gradually, they don't change drastically overnight."
"There's no difference between taking your one 42(c) shot *because a judge is gay* and filing a fruitless motion to disqualify for cause *because a judge is gay*. Maybe you don't make yourself look like a fool on a 42(c), and the reason behind it may be opaque to the court, but it's obviously not opaque to the lawyer or the client.  Using that reason to pre-empt a judge is bigotry. It was then and it is now. It's also pretty monumentally stupid to pre-empt a judge to cater to your own/your client's irrational prejudices and risk winding up with a much worse judge for another reason. As you should know. 

 Do you let your clients screen out Jewish, black, and female judges too? How about the ones who are just monumentally uninterested or untrained in the type of case you're filing?"

Ask the Black community what he has ever done for them?"
"cont. My 1st human services job for pay was as a vocational counselor at a non-profit in East Cleveland. More than 90% of our clients were black. I came to Eugene in 1975 to complete my B.S. at the UO. A cop stopped me within 30 minutes of landing at the airport. Back then EPD kept a photo book of all black men that stayed in town for more than a week. When the UO found out that I didn't want to play football, I couldn't see an academic advisor until I got to grad school. I am president emeritus of the Eugene Springfield branch of the Eugene Springfield NAACP. I helped the 1st black cop to become to become a detective at EPD.  I'm a founding board member of WellSpring Friends School to help kids that didn't fit in at 4J. I'm the 1st black man to successfully sue EPD for false arrest. They mistook my 15 year old ward and his friend for a 30 year old Mexican bank robber. I'm the only black person to be a manager in the 100 year history of EWEB."

"These so-called ""patriot"" groups are armed and dangerous and are willing to shoot not only police but others who disagree with them over land use laws.  I want to protect the names of officers, who in the process of engaging this group, need the protection of anonymity.  This armed group of angry people are capable of attacking anyone as they target police officers.  This is different than releasing the name of an officer who shoots an unarmed black person, etc.  This is an organized group who is being funded by the likes of the Koch brothers on a mission to convert public lands to local control.  It is a bullying tactic. We even have people running for elected office on this platform."

Second, the slavery or heliocentric exemples as old 'Christian ' beliefs that are now outdated is at least ignorant, there is nothing in the Bible that supports chattel slavery, nor heliocentrism. Absolutely nothing! Thirdly, a church embracing the gay or transgender lifestyle as pleasing to God is no longer practicing Christianity, rather their own invented religion. The church is to welcome all but Not condone all behavior. If this mans original church mistreated him that's wrong but they were quite within their rights to fire him provided they did so in a fair and equitable manner.

"There is next to no evidence that slaves actually fought for the Confederacy.  It wasn't until like early 1865 that the Confederate Congress approved conscripting slaves as war fighters.  Apparently,  only two companies of black troops were drilling in Richmond when Lee surrendered at Appomattox. 

Hell, even in the North, there was considerable resistance to arming black troops to fight for the Union, although eventually something like 190,000 black men fought in the Union Army and Navy. 

You need to check the record about Lee being anti-slavery.  Rich slave owners like Lee, and Jefferson and Washington,  found themselves in a situation where their personal feelings about slavery were of little consequence.  More and more often before the war, state and local laws actually forbade freeing one's slaves in one's will, or even freeing them at all, particularly en masse. ."

"So blacks and gays are now targeting the police. Perfect. As if that is going to change any respect those groups have for one another. It's only going to rule out the support and assistance the police have given to these groups. 
Next time a black or gay person needs police support, good luck with that. The police should just ignore both communities and let them fend for themselves. Black crime in the northwest and northeast of Toronto should just be allowed to fester. The police now have a license to only deal with and address when these groups commit criminal acts against other communities. Hopefully this will reduce the high cost of police presence in the black communities. Let them rot."

General Lee, by contrast, wanted to educate blacks so that when they were freed they could be successful in society;  his will stipulated manumission, not deportation from the US.

Let me rephrase it with facts and reality:
Canadians knows very much how lucky we've been. Through our 150 years of history, we smartly created a new country to shield ourselves from the epic national blow up in the U.S. called Civil War. A country of slavery and deep racism towards blacks, imperial expansion towards the west via war and genocide on natives. The lawlessness of the Wild West is legend. An ambitious America who shameless stole all that can be stolen from the British Empire. Then, just when Canada able to catch a breadth, its imperial master the UK proceeded to wage two epic world wars on Europe and the world. In the name of empire, colonialism."

So today, other methods of bringing them back to the plantation are now being employed, ones that will surely increase the Democratic Party's hold on them.
Don't think slavery has been abolished, they just hid the chains and many don't even know they wear them. They call out others with labels, like racist simply because they disagree. But like Mr. Farrakan, maybe the racist has a point; we the people are the ones who give permission to government, not vise versa. We control the means of our own liberty, not government.

They get a free round trip bus/train ticket to where ever, and if they work for a given period (the whole picking season) in addition to their wages, they get part or all of their welfare benefits.  

We'd be paying them bennies anyway if they sat at home, so I'm not sure it's a loss to taxpayers.  Could possibly allow growers to pay at a reduced wage to encourage participation.  Unfortunately, I can just hear Al Sharpton if a program sent inner city blacks to work on rural farms.  The plantation/slave comparisons would be endless.  Never mind that it might help them, or not be limited to them; the outrage would be overwhelming."

The analogy ends there. The US government made a conscious decision to give amnesty & pardon those who fought for the south. Lee effectively ended the war by surrendering and kept it from restarting 2 years later by talking down those southerners who wanted to. He supported Johnson's plan for Reconstruction & became a symbol that aided its success. He was a productive, loyal member of American society the rest of his life.  He was neither pro-secession nor vehemently pro-slavery. He was a complex man (supported black education but not the right to vote); a product of his time. 

Where Arnold was ticked off at America & out for revenge, Lee fought the Union out of loyalty to his state, which democratically voted to secede. When he had the chance to bring the war to a close, he took it. Yes, he fought against his former country. But simplistic analysis of this man is impossible."

Blacks like you are the Uncle Toms as they say, as you are protecting the Democrats against this FACT that all those statues and monuments may be Confederates, but most of them are also Democrats that owned slaves, and not all Confederates supported slavery, just the Democrats did, You Democrats did not count on older wiser men like me to still be around with our truth about the Democrats Using black fools like you to do their slavery work."
"Just one of the host of General officers now running the nation's privatized military with unlimited funding, highly paid in salary and benefits, but the same greed merchants found throughout the ruling Corporate Oligarchy.  All willing to sell their souls and the nation to anyone with the right price.  All provided free government education at West Point just like Rep. Eastman filled with fundamentalist christianity, racism, bigotry, and Republican traitorous ideology.  None of them ever paying for the failed strategies in operations resulting in death and disablement of troops and ""war"" failings.  The worst they get for traitorous acts is retirement with golden parachute pensions, government jobs, and/or Corporate Financial positions.  The rot contained within the entire government has reached the point where only revolution will remove the black stains created by the massive deregulation and loss of civilian moral control of the nation.  Time for a Revolution."
"You wrote the other day that the march was populated by people who were just curious. 
As to the hypocrisy of the call for inclusion while calling it a ""Women's March,""  the title of the march did not imply that only women could march. There were men there because they also were marching FOR the equal treatment of women.
As to protesting Trump's actions, the marchers had many signs noting Trump's actions in his speech about grabbing women. He has also said women who get an abortion should be punished. Yes, some signs were crude. But just as so many have excused Trump, who among us has not said something we later regretted?
Considering the marchers were a bunch of ""liberal women"" (and curiosity seekers, as you said before) it is ""funny"" (using the passive aggressive sarcastic term) that you seem to put so much effort in discrediting that 7,000 PEOPLE marched on a cold rainy day to air their grievances. Only 7,000? My 83 year-old mother hoped to march, but infirmity kept her home. 7001?"
"Boozer:  You mention that people who really would benefit from help are not getting it.  Could you expand on this point.  I believe we should be targeting our assistance where it will really help those who are willing to help themselves.  Additionally, there is, I believe, a population of folks among the homeless who need supportive living placement.  I refer here to the mentally-ill, developmentally disabled, physically disabled, vets with PTSD , etc.    The substance addicted and chronic alcoholics do need support...usually a residential treatment program....if they're to change their lives.

Who are those who you refer to as not getting help?  What kinds of help would you propose? and how do you feel about those other sub-sets of the homeless?  

I'd enjoy sitting down with you over a cup of coffee and discussing these issues.  I'd like to better understand your perspective.  Let me know if you'd be interested.  regards,  Gary"
"Thanks, Jim. I couldn't get the second link to work, but read the bit on the first. I am unsurprised that there are more options in the Bay Area.  I'd assure the pastor there, however, that his church is not the only one in the US hosting a Black Jesus. That's how He's styled here at St. Sabina."

"""Wrong!""

He DID lead the Birther movement.

He DID mock a disabled reporter.

He DID take out a full page ad calling for the wrongly convicted blacks in  NYC to be put to death.

He DID get caught discriminating against blacks in his rental buildings - TWICE!

He DID boast of grabbing women's genitalia.

He DID stiff several contractors.

He DID bankrupt a casino.

He DID lose nearly a billion dollars in one year.

He DID declare business bankruptcies - SIX times.

He DID encourage violence at his rallies.

He DID insult a Gold Star family.

He DID insult a genuine war hero.

He DID avoid paying Federal taxes for nearly two decades.

He DID cheat on all three of his wives.

His closest advisors DO  run alt-'right'/neo-nazi sites - and are quite proud of it.

He DID fill his Cabinet with the very same people who caused the problems back in W's time.

There is, of course, much more that he's done, so exactly which ""lies"" ""the media"" told about him remains a mystery."
"I heard about Leah McLaren from comments in Margaret Wendt's article about Are Today's Dad's really so pathetic? I had to check it out. And I have kept an open mind.  But, reading her (McLaren's) work is like pulling hangnails. She has some good points, but her smugness against dads is quite telling. Her use of slang like 'snowflakes' and 'whevs' ('whatever' in a valley girl dialect?) is instructive. She talks about how much praise to give to children THEN switches to husbands, speaking as though men are like children and women are the adults who have to train their dogs. Her condescension is appalling. 

One reason I am writing here is that Father's Day articles give back-handed insults to men. (""Kids are fat? - Blame dad"") Happy Father's Day! Ms. McLaren should follow Janice Fiamengo who mentions the difficult, dirty, dangerous jobs done by men who get no gratitude. Bill Burr quipped ""All the mothers with black lung!"" And Oprah telling men to ""BE BETTER!"" a year ago with Ms. Obama."
"The ANC's talk of radical economic transformation now, after more than  is a simple demonstration of their failure.

"Yes, this letter writer hits the hypocritical nail on the head.  Regardless of others' opinion of black make-up, its application is a matter of personal choice and a matter of expression which only harms others through their dislike of the idea it represents (to them).

Secondly, the Negro Football League has gotten out of hand, this is a GAME, not a stump, not a environment to protest anything while in uniform, and at work, So Guv, what else 'ya got?"

"Please do not put Black Lives Matter in the same category as Antifa.  Very rarely has BLM engaged in or preached violence.  It is part of ""implicit bias"" that people see violence tendencies in black people where there is none.  Antifa, unfortunately, has good intentions but actively preaches violence.   It is generally not fatal violence, not homicidal, but rather a violence of fists and clubs (which of course themselves can accidentally result in violence.)  I support the goals of both groups but condone violence only in a case of necessary self-defense."

"David Brooks: ""Those who believe in open believe in open trade, relatively open immigration, an active foreign policy and racial integration. Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade, closed borders, a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism.""

""Open trade"" that was all about giving more power to multinational corporations so they could move their factories to low-wage countries and sell the products back to US consumers.

""Relatively open immigration"" to provide more cheap labor for the corporations.

""Active foreign policy"" that was all about perpetual war to advance US ""interests"" that were clearly not mine, using working-class kids who have no better options to do the fighting.

""Racial integration"" using cops to kill blacks.

"""Most all""? I don't think so.  

It was funny thirty years ago when I first heard it, but there has never been much evidence to support the claim.  Most people couldn't hit the broad side of a LIO with a long gun, much less a pistol, and I've frequently seen people waving guns around with no care in the world for anyone's safety, their own included.  I've nearly been shot twice, both at ranges by someone forgetting to eject the last round from a chamber after removing the magazine.  Twice that I'm aware of.  Both of those times the weapons discharged; no one was hurt.  One guy who's gun went off while several people were downrange, actually laughed and the person next to him awarded him the coveted Black Eye of Stupidity and Failure to Know How This Danged Thing Works Medal.  Both were summarily ejected and asked not to return.  
   
But thanks for your two cents worth."
Yep.  I remember years ago reading excerpts from Columbus' journals that clearly stated he took Gambian Muslims with him as interpreters to communicate with the black folks he found in the Bahamas when he landed there.  Never once saw those excerpts referred to in any 'history' book--certainly not the ones foisted on us in school.

"Trump can't get by the FACT (that word seems to be missing from his vocabulary) that not only 3 million more people voted for Hillary than for him, that same 3 million people chose a woman over him. Add to that the FACT that the outgoing president, who is a black man, had a popularity rating of 60%, while at the same time Trump's popularity was at 32% and falling. Incidentally, these are the ""original facts"", I have yet to see the ""alternative facts"" regarding these issues."

"No, a president has very little to do with abolishing constitutional rights, even if she wanted to. The original Second Amendment guaranteed the right of well-regulated state militias -- essentially, all free men -- to train and be prepared to defend freedom against a potential overweening federal government. But after the Civil War -- given that southern states had used those militias instead to oppress people (blacks) and suppress freedoms (whereas the federal government had freed people) -- the Second Amendment was reinterpreted (by the Fourteenth Amendment and other Reconstruction acts) to include the right of individuals to protect themselves, so that (for instance) freed blacks could defend themselves against the rising Ku Klux Klan. And that's where we stand today. Regulations are constitutional, and the right to defend oneself is constitutional. For more on this -- and on what it would take to change it -- read the wonderful constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar."
"I will keep saying there is nothing in the bible that says so called Christians can't bake cakes, gays can't marry or insist so called Christians should discriminate. These Bible literalist, literally can't find one passage that they can use to defend their actions. They conveniently ignore passages that cover all kinds equal sin's that is what makes this whole thing baloney. Mean while, here is the deal we live in a secular nation, annd this man can practice his religion all he wants but he cannot discriminate. Where does it end, no cakes for muslims? Blacks? Latinos? No, it is going backwards."
"Not nice.  When I lived  in Mississippi in 1967 my mother was fired from her job in a sewing store,  Her big crime?  My mom let a black lady change her baby's diaper in the bathroom.  The manager called the black lady ""uppity"" and fired my mom on the spot,  The fact is that all of us have rights.  The players can protest and I can watch something else.  If these players really cared, they would be doing what my mom did.  She joined the Civil Rights Movement and became a JFK volunteer."
"Trump and his crew and the Religious Right and the Alt-right ginned up all of this hatred to anyone they deem to be 'the other' like Hispanics, Blacks, we non-republicans, etc. Now the innocent Jewish people are paying the price of all of the free floating hatred. It attaches to us all. 
On another note--
My Rabbi friend is a professor at a Rabbinical college AND in charge of their security  --  AND, he helped out with the security of the Catholic seminary on an adjoining campus. He told me after I spent years of helping him with my electronic knowledge. He was/is terrific. I was pleased but knowing him I would have expected nothing less, he was that kind of guy as were all of the many Jews that I knew. 
I would return to help them if I weren't so disabled. 
I had four coursees in Catholic Philosophy and Jewish Philosophy is EQUALLY as fascinating. They both give a strung moral compass.  I wanted to take a course in Jewish Philosophy at their college but that never materialized."
They should ask non-black teachers about how they feel about the unwarranted racist rants towards them by racist black students.
"As many have pointed out, Congressional Republicans wanted to abandon the auto industry and opposed all stimulus. Without congressional Democrats and Obama's leadership we would have entered a prolonged, deepening recession. The only reason we didn't  have a quick recovery is that for the first time since the Great Depression Congress didn't allow or enact direct stimulus to create jobs, which would also have left us, at this time, with a far lower national debt.

The ACA did in fact stop the previous annual double-digit inflation in insurance premiums, and the gradual and increasing inflation has only happened recently. ACA could not have passed Congress without removal of bargaining rights for pharmaceuticals as part of the regulations.

You are right, it was time for the US to have a Black president, or a woman president, or an Hispanic president, or in fact, any decent president."

"Talking about murdering politicians is dreadful, especially in a country where that's always a possibility.

"Ahh, prohibition! Isn't it great?
This is so much better than legalizing heroin, cocaine, and so on, and regulating their production and distribution via licensed dispensaries.

Plus, under prohibition, we get all the exciting news about drug-related gang turf wars, and the property crime that goes toward paying for drugs...
And society gets to pay through the nose so that first responders can whizz around all day long to fentanyl overdose after carfentanil overdose!
Government is so smart. It just does the best, most smartest thing all the time.
After all, we don't want to ""send the wrong message"" by legalizing and regulating drugs, do we?
That would be awful. It's far better that people who use do so in full risk of their lives, some as prolific property criminals, each contributing financially to the growth of violent black markets that negatively affect entire communities.

I support the aims of the Black Riders. I'm a radical. Radicalism has a long history in the United States, and without it, American democracy would be weaker. William Lloyd Garrison, the famous abolitionist was an American radical as was Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were patriotic Americans who improved the lives of Americans and made the United States the great country--contrary to what Trump supporters claim-- that it is. Your ignorance doesn't scare me. I doubt it scares anyone."

"I never said ""94%"" of black voters are paid by welfare.  I may have said that 94% vote Democrat, and they all have friends, neighbors, and relatives who are on welfare, which is about 22% of the black population.  The other 78% who aren't on welfare support the Democrat welfare program so they don't have to take care of their ne'er-do-well friends, neighbors, and relatives themselves.  The 78% who completed their education, got jobs, didn't have babies before they got married, and didn't commit crimes are doing pretty well in this not-as-racist-as-you-imply society.

It's poor personal choices that land people on the Welfare Plantation. Race has little to do with it.  Attitude has almost everything to do with it."

Why do ""we"", the majority of reasonable Americans, continue to tolerate this crap, or worse enable it via silence?"
Republicans have never had near the majority of Hispanics or African Americans.  Not likely to either.
"Ezra Levant is a spent force. He is an Islamophobe. As well as someone who hates Quebecers, First Nations, and the Roma people. He's been sued successfully for libel many times. I doubt you can find more than two ideas Ezra Levant has had that aren't abhorrent. 

Don't confuse license with liberty. The xenophobia encouraged by Trump and people like Kellie Leitch has led directly to an alarming increase in attacks on Muslims, Jews, Blacks, and other visible minorities. 

Angela Merkel is not a Leftist. And it seems you  suffer from sinistrophobia. It drives otherwise sane people to say silly things such as Alberta's PCs are ""socialists"" or accuse the G&M of having a leftwing agenda. Free speech is a fine thing, but you shouldn't speak if you're free of ideas."
"What a sad end to this officer's career. I highly doubt she went to work looking to kill a black guy. She made a mistake and now needs to pay the price. 

That being said, it is a sad day in this country that this situation came to this. If they tased him too early when he first started disobeying the orders, he sues the police for excessive use of force. Instead, they let this continue and it gets to the point where the officer is on edge and makes a mistake. Granted, she made the mistake and has to own up to it. But the truth of the matter is if you FOLLOW AN OFFICERS ORDERS, you will be fine. In almost every shooting, it always starts with a suspect not following the officers commands.

If you don't like the officers commands and think they are unjust, follow them anyways and then hire an attorney after the incident is over. Why is that common sense approach so difficult? I don't get it. Just respect the job the police have to do and comply. It is really that simple."
"Golly, the article asks if there is anything to celebrate for BHM, and then the following gets censored:

"Our youngest has MS and a seizure disorder and we've been lucky enough to have had 2 seizure alert dogs for her. Her first was in 2003 and there were only 2 places in the country that even trained seizure alert dogs at that time. Her first dog died in 2013 and we were able to get another in 2014. It usually takes at least 2 years to train these dogs before they can even be placed and I have to tell you, both of the dogs have been absolutely amazing. The first was a black lab and the one we have now is a golden lab. 

Do your research on these places who claim they train service dogs and ask for references. These dogs are not cheap, usually they will run around 20K (we got her first dog thru Make A Wish and the 2nd thru fundraising) and if trained correctly, worth every penny."

Of course the restaurant owner, who sponsored the little darling BOTH times, knew nothing about this: until he got into a pay dispute with the fraudster, then shazzam, suddenly he looked familiar and the owner squealed on the immigrant.

"Projecting your own biases onto others doesn't make them true. Just because the media echo chamber wants to paint all of Trump's supporters as racists doesn't make it so.

In many cases the methane in the drinking water was associated with other contamination from fracking chemicals.  These were not isolated instances.  It's quite likely that with Trump's plans to decimate the EPA and other agencies will result in less oversight of this kind of stuff.  You can be certain that the fracking industry is lobbying for relaxed regulations which they're likely to get with the Trump administration.  Maybe it's drinking water.  Maybe it's air quality or pesticides in food or...  Fear tactic?  Yeah, this kind of stuff should frighten us all."
"No, what it means is that Clinton abandoned the typical Democrat base - thinking, wrongly, that women and blacks and latinos would flood the polling places and she wouldn't need her base.  

And that base DID feel abandoned.  Even Bill tried to tell her - but she moved so far left to please those on the fringe, they felt no compunction in leaving her behind.   It was not a racial vote - except perhaps on her part.  It was an economic vote and worry about making ends meet....something she refused to admit."
"Good point, Chris.  But what to do?  Boko Haram is a truly odious organization.  Providing weapons to Nigeria is fraught with risk; a significant portion of all African aid ends up lining the pockets of black marketeers, corrupt governments, or both.  Add automatic weapons or grenade launchers to that list and you have disaster waiting to happen.

On the other hand, if he sends military support – even training – the move will be seen as imperialist by most of the world, and war-mongering by the far left.  I don’t like or trust Trump, but there are some wingnuts out there who would vilify him even if he brokered Middle East peace and reunited Led Zeppelin.

And to do nothing is perhaps the worst choice of all.  We are speaking of an organization that kidnaps and enslaves children for political ends."

But people of good will sheltered people of color against the haters.  The same thing is happening today because hatred does not die.  We welcome undocumented immigrants into our churches.

People have their modern day witch hunts against undocumented immigrants."
And this is why Black folks should stay out of the woods...
"Great exhibit, check it out, the LCHM, OBP,  and the Rutherfords should be proud of this material too often missing from our history.  Oregon's African-American pioneers faced a tough life just to survive. 
 And the Oregon Electric was a great line that shouldn't have been lost.

Here in Lane County, black railroad  workers were pioneers--Leo and Pearlie Mae Washington were the first permanent African-American    family to live here, arriving  in 1937.  He worked for the  Southern Pacific railroad  as a baggage handler and crew hauler.  They later took in black  boarders,  often railroad workers who couldn't stay in  local hotels. 

And of course our most famous early black resident was Wiley Griffon, who arrived about 1889 to operate the mule-powered ""Eugene Street Railway Co."" and later worked as a waiter on the railroad, allowing him to buy his home on the millrace at 4th and Mill in 1908, becoming Eugene's first African-American home owner."

"Cyril's comments are not particularly radical, in fact most people would subscribe to them. The one thing most rural people don't want though is land. Experience with land restitution thus far indicates that between 70% and 90% of recipients of returned land opt to take the money instead. I have a feeling that the land requirements of all black people genuinely wanting to farm as a profession could be easily met from existing stocks of state or ""tribal"" land. The Government has shown little desire to re-distribute land - it just wants to nationalise it"
"The methods that BLM employed in this situation were disgusting. Pride caving to it, almost more so. It is neither anti gay nor anti black to say that. Enough with this PC ""can't criticize him or her because they are part of a marginalized group"" nonsense. I both support equal rights for all people, and support Pride (or I did support Pride before this embarrassment)."
"I'm not entirely sure what your point is, but let me clarify mine: Just because Communism Governments CLAIM to be acting in the interests of the working class and of equality doesn't mean that they actually are (and history shows us that they have emphatically not been). Just like, though Verwoerd may have claimed that Apartheid was in the interests of black people it clearly wasn't."
"By her logic of racial guilt and indelible  shame, all black people are as guilty as the black guy who  steal my car,"

"You're woefully short on your understanding of MLK. First, he advocated ""militant non-violence"". He espoused the belief that violence meant the message was completely lost. Second, MLK consistently expressed the belief that people would be judged by their character and not the color of their skin.  All people. Finally, and most importantly, MLK expressed the Christian belief that people can change and find redemption. 

Today, we have outreach efforts to gang members who kill, rob, and engage in unlawfulness. Similarly, people who embrace racist ideologies are morally lost. MLK always stated that people are morally equal. He believed in engagement. 

Consequently, violence is always wrong. Engagement to bring people away from fringe elements should always be the goal. No one has a right to engage in vandalism or destruction of property because they mistakenly believe they're morally superior to everyone else."

"The Southern Baptist Convention, which had black preachers even before the US Revolution, might be astounded to discover that they foster segregation.  But there are only 15.29 million of them; how many of them have you 'met'?

It is ""the largest Protestant body in the United States, with over 15 million members as of 2015. This also makes it the second-largest Christian body in the United States, after the Catholic Church.  Must be all those Catholics that are racists., Huh?  All 68 million of them in the US?  

Your narrow, bigoted (and racist) viewpoint has to ignore at least 150 million Christians to justify itself.

100% with the police on this one. If police are excluded from Pride then it should receive zero funding. Maybe the Black Lives Matter crew will fund it.
"Without a doubt, Obama is the most despicable president in American history. He has set back race relations some 75 years, and released over 1000+ prisoners so far, mostly black, to prey on the law abiding citizens after he is gone from office. You know that many of them will not be good citizens."
"""As a result, there will probably be no reform of the personal income tax.""

This strikes me as possibly the most important sentence in Tom Reese's article. It seems to me that most of his rationale for tax reform failing has to do with fear of voter reactiosn, and that reaction is determined by expectations of how people's personal taxes are affected. 

Far fewer people pay attention to the affects of taxation on corporations. And the fact is, Trump and the Republicans are determined more than anything else to lower corporate taxes. Blow black is far less likely. Since Trump and the congress now need a WIN, any WIN, the odds, its seems to me, of a successful reduction of corporate taxes is very likely. 

The argument that lower corporate taxes increase jobs, although repeatedly demonstrated, generatoin after generation, country after country, to be false, is a self evident truth for Trump and the Repubs. Trump's base will be fed and will feast on this delusion. Ergo its a done deal."
"So, your ""friend"" Jack either doesn't like black people or people to have healthcare?  Not sure what else would make sense...  Ahh identity politics at its finest!"
"When Obama told the nation in the D.C. professor case that "" police acted stupidly "" before even knowing the facts----he told black America it was ok to hate police . When he told the nation last week that group Black Lives Matters was a justified group even though in their protests they chanted about wanting pigs in a blanket and wanting dead cops now---he told black America it's ok to attack police.  Obama sides based on color and  not the facts of each situation .  His very words are a wink to those blacks who use every event as a chance to steal and destroy others property .     And in other news : How many blacks slaughtered other blacks last night in Chicago ? It's clear Obama and Black Lives Matters don't care about lost black lives if the shooter is black."
"That goes way back to when blacks found out that they were considered genetically superior physically, almost all blacks practice reverse racism"

"This really says a lot about Trump's perspective when it comes to seniors, the poor, and the disabled. 
When a President selects an ambassador he makes sure he selects one with great knowledge and talent in countries he considers important. But he selects his campaign supporters for countries where he just doesn't care. So if one gets a career, talented ambassador, one knows that that country is important.

Now, Ben Carson's selection says Trump just doesn't care to select someone with knowledge of the complicated life at HUD, in fact, to me, this signals that Trump will be doing what he can to pull a ""Reagan"", use tax cuts to the rich to impoverish the low income seniors and disabled people who depend on HUD housing. 
So he has selected a woman to help destroy the Department of Public Education, and a black man to help destroy HUD. 
Diversity.

Perhaps it would be better for him to go in a Hercules plane full of food stuffs paid for by him personally.  Then he should leave as soon as the plane is unloaded and leaves.

"Geezerly, Trump's political career began in advocacy of birtherism, that modern recasting of the old American precept that black people are not fit to be citizens of the country they built. 

But long before birtherism, Trump had made his worldview clear. 

He fought to keep blacks out of his buildings, according to the U.S. government; called for the death penalty for the eventually exonerated Central Park Five; and railed against “lazy” black employees. 

“Black guys counting my money! I hate it,” Trump was once quoted as saying.

"I think Mr. Card was right on target with the word 'mawkish'--sentimental in a feeble or sickly way. Instead of engaging in a thoughtful discussion with her students about Dr. Tweedy's book she dons an Afro and puts black paint on her hands and face? She WAS being sentimental--patronizingly so to both Tweedy's memoir and especially her Black students experiences of racism. Mawkish captures it all- feeble, sickly, sentimental. Yuk. I don't care if she meant well, seriously, get a clue."
"It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with CLASS. The war on drugs unfairly targets the POOR.  The fact that racial minorities in both the USA (Latinos and African Americans) and in Canada (First Nations) are dis proportionally affected by these policies is because they make up a larger percentage of the ""poor"" demographic than they do the general population. The result is that their racial group is being more affected by policies that unfairly target the poor.

Now this doesn't account for sentencing, plea bargains, etc where there is definitely systemic racism involved.

Address the issue of poverty and why racial minorities are disproportionately represented in the poor demographic and you will solve many other ""race"" issues in the process"
You do realize that almost every black person in NA that is alive today is so because at least one of their ancestors was a slave. I'm not trying to justify slavery just pointing out that contrary to what you say it wasn't all bad.

This does not mean the entire country does.  In fact, most laws passed in the last fifty years have been highly favorable to minorities.  Inclusiveness, we have to be inclusive.   Diversity, we have to be diverse.   Multicultural, we have to be multicultural.   Any of these statements sound familiar?  They should.  They have been repeated constantly in the news and in public media for decades.  What is it that we celebrate for the entire month of February?   Is it how much we disrespect  a certain class of people?  Or is it how much we promote them?  When there are so many ways that we go out of our way to promote that class of people, do not try to say with a straight face that we disrespect them."
"Europe took us for a ride for half a century. We lowered our tariffs and they kept theirs high. We opened our labor markets to their people and they kept theirs shut against ours.

If that were true why did it take another 20 years until Republicans finally won the majority in the Congress?  Why did we have to experience the incompetence of Carter and lies of Clinton for both of their terms?  It is easy to call an entire portion of the country racist instead of admitting that the Democratic Party has been taken over by a bunch of radical leftist.

"I think the fans Trump is trying to incite should really think about potential consequences for jumping on Trump's bandwagon, particularly Season ticketholders and stadium attendees.

The NFL owners have basically taken a position.  They're going to accommodate, without penalty, player non-vilent demonstrations during the presentation of the anthem.  Some are ging to stand right there with them to demonstrate personal approval or aquiecence.  

Seems to me that most owner/managers are prone to protecting employees, particularly against emotional customers.  The thinking is that attack on employees precedent must be deterred, and overall morale of, as well as ability to ""retain"" a workforce enhanced.

Black players constitute a clear majority of the NFL feature workforce (80%??).  Without them, the NFL product would really be inferior.  Driving them out en masse would NO DOUBT merely transfer that workforce to new owners.

"While there are decent passages in this address, overall it's so bad one wonders where to begin. What would a person unfamiliar with the alt-right take away from this rambling, unfocused piece? What characterizes the alt-right? Does it have a coherent ideology? Is it simply an internet phenom, a cohort of ideologically aligned, discrete far-right factions, a transnational eruption manipulated by political operatives? What distinguishes the alt-right from more traditional conservatism? Rather the audience is advised to dog-ear a critique of the Enlightenment and be sure to finger-wag Black Lives Matter.

"I feel it's important to point out that the rally in Charlottesville was not just racist. It was anti-Semitic and it was anti-LGBTQ as well. The slurs the Nazis and KKK were using moved from racial slurs to gay slurs to anti-Semitic slurs with frightening regularity. They wanted to make sure they terrorized certain groups of people and they did just that. Jewish folks, LGBTQ and people of color are now feeling trepidation when walking home alone at night in Charlottesville (and many other areas of this country). 
I only mention this because Trump has already broken his word on ""supporting LGBTQ people"" and it makes me wonder if that's who he'll hit next in order to rally his base AGAIN. Since the Nazi's were very vocal in their gay hate rhetoric in Charlottesville, I think it's a subject that should be discussed openly and honestly before something bad happens and Catholics wish they had spoken against the homophobic rhetoric being spewed by the Nazis.   
My two cents worth."
"Agree. Anyone who supports totalitarianism, violence, and racism in any form deserves to be condemned. I didn't vote for Trump, but he repudiated support from David Duke a long time ago and he should repudiate the professed support of today's thugs as well. It would be great to also see Democrats renounce violence from the militants in Antifa and Black Lives Matter movements, too, who seem to get a pass from the media and Democrats for their violent protests and destruction of private and public property."

In general Chris Rock will tell you that he loves black people but hates (n words). Because he can't stand an ignorant person.  Or as I call it a ghetto person.  

However I will say that being outspoken shouldn't equal a bullet.  If all folks had to worry about was a beat down from the police than there wouldn't be a movement.  Currently America is in what I like to call the trigger happy Wild West trend.  If we as Americans went back to beating each other up rather than shooting one another it might be a different story were reading.

Maybe Denver should look at who goes to jail and who shouldn't.  Reforms should always begin with the gate keepers of any jail (DPD).  Two men of color who only have a warrant for trespassing.

Why would a police officer choose to exert their authority on mental transient who I am sure they know.  I am sure they wanted to fill their Dailey log sheet.  Maybe criminal justice reforms needs to begin with the officers who bring these people to a place they really don't belong in.

And where would you hear those comments? You are not close enough with any black people that you go to their house for dinner and holidays, or they drive you to the doctor when you're sick, or you watch their kids when something comes up. If you were, you wouldn't need to ""hear any comments"", you'd already know."
"Enough of the antifa and black lives matter biggots. Trump was never a racist. Police need to be involved because they are""first contact"" with street criminal activity. When you find out that the person is XYZ this needs to be passed onto other justice divisions. There are countless examples every year of bad people being stopped for something and you find out this person was the terrorist suspect, murder suspect etc."
"If the rebels had won this war this little girl would never  go to school again , she would never drive a car and would not be allowed to leave her house unless she had a male relative escort her .

"That’s it jerk, glorify the lowest elements of our society, the gang culture. I hope you’re using that $135 million of your net worth to change your black culture for the better and to end the drug/gang/fatherless families that it appears to do nothing itself to cure other than whine “poor me”"
"LFS2,  great idea about the guided walking tour,  you've interested me in walking the solar system.
I've been involved with a few historic tours of downtown  myself and wish we had more of this.  An  interesting local  fact is that the homesite of the last black person to own property in Eugene , Wiley  Griffon, was right down the hill almost visible from  the Mims' houses.    It was on the corner of 4th and Mill, (EWEB parking)  along the old Millrace.  From the time he died  in 1913, not another African-American was known to  own property in Eugene until the Mims around 1949.

"" What evidence does Nokes present that ....' the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.”   For that, Old Friend,, you'll have to dig out of Nokes (and McClagan) yourself.   It's worth it to know the real history of this state we love but which  has had its dark side.  You'll see why the  Mims' speakers, historic marker, and info boards all mentioned the exclusion laws."
"Anthony, the problem is that there is no coherent, singular voice from prominent black athletes. some say its the oppression, some say it is Trump, some say it is the killing of black men by the police.... There is a great opportunity for these people, many of whom are revered by the masses, to use their position to get the message across. But they chose to get behind a bad role model (remember Kaepernicks 'pig socks'? they are offensive to anyone who respects the police) and then doubled down by disrespecting the flag. 

Maybe what the NFLPA should  do is select a committee of players to meet with the DOJ to address their concerns as a unified body with one message. then make another committee to discuss the plight of the inner cities and discuss some 'workfare' programs. Then another to talk about educational opportunities. 

the athletes complain, but where are they with discussions of solutions - without that, they are spoiled whiners."
"So., was obumma the stupid black monkey?"
"Obuma loves to hear himself talk, he was neutered in the last by election for gross incompetence - Trump is the outcome 

Yes Obuma states blacks MUST vote to keep his legacy alive - oooops, they even stayed at home! 

The Democrats look like fools on all fronts, what a bunch of soar loosers."
"Sam Clovis, Donald Trump's pick to be chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture, pushed unfounded theories about then-President Barack Obama's upbringing and called then-Attorney General Eric Holder a ""racist black,"" a CNN KFile review of Clovis's writings and radio broadcasts during 2012 and 2013 has found.

Clovis was a conservative radio host and political activist in Iowa before gaining national attention as one of the more vocal supporters of Trump during the presidential campaign. 

His nomination to head science at the USDA requires Senate confirmation.

Let's just see if Lisa votes to confirm a racist who is not a scientist to be Trump's head scientist at the Dept. of Agriculture.

Watching your next move Lisa."
"Your actually not worth my time. I'm married to a Mexican american. Sooo what the hell does that mean. You still are a closet racist and can't admit there is room for improvement in the US. I don't care who you're married to, you still have a problem if you can't admit that calling a black person a monkey probably hurts worse than showing a meme of GW as a monkey.
 The other thing is how do you know anyone was raped back in the 1800's. Dude you might be straight forward, but as of now I call B/S.
 You start out married to a woman of color. But then you turn into a man of color. You are a f'n troll. We are done. You're about as black as my Irish  family. What a loser you are. Oh by the way put down the bottle so you will be able to read, I'm not remorse.
 Yes I'll tell you about racism and utopias because you seem ignorant to it all. Go back to mama's basement and leave folks with a brain alone"
"Your own comments here come across as being very racially insensitive.

Why on earth would you side against an oppressed black woman, a victim of racism?"
"Sure...because cops goto work thinking ""I'm gonna shoot a black person today. Mark my words"" 

His hands went up THEN HE WALKED AWAY AND REACHED INTO A CAR. He created the situation by doing this. He fueled tension and adrenaline, once he was hit with that tazer the female cop flinched...so, I ask again...why was NOT compliant and walking away? Why reach in the car? Who cares what the helicopter guy said, he didnt force the suspect to be non compliant."
"Ms Manigault came across as a very brave, intelligent and poised spokeswoman for the Trump administration.  She displayed these qualities in an obviously hostile and biased arena.  

When confronted by a black male plainly saddled with intimidation, bullying and domination issues, Manigault simply was brilliant!"
"Why don't you ask some black folks about this ""joke."""
"I saw plenty of it in Malaysia and Indonesia a few years go. There was a demonstration in Jakarta with hundreds of women in niqabs demanding more shariah law...

If you ""raise them right"", they will demand it themselves!

Wow, dragging in Us blacks to justify how the Koran and shariah discredit women's testimony, really?

Women are pretty equal in all the western world today, you are equating the sniffles with lung cancer.

""A woman cannot become the President of the USA, even though they form 51 percent of the population. The same is true of Canada.""  Lol, that really exposes how twisted this yes, because we all know how wrong that is.

Single motherhood is something many women actually choose these days, wisely or not, because they benefit from enough social programs and economic freedom to make that possible, and the social stigma has all but disappeared, including measures to ensure the fathers contribute financially. Unlike in countries where it unthinkable."
"Irrelevant drivel. Prejudice exists in all races. In North America,  blacks are much more prejudiced against than they are prejudiced. To suggest otherwise is stupidly inflammatory."
"Steinberg got him off, but with some validity, only some. Race-wise, yeah, a lower income person of any race isn't going to afford Steinberg. Black pro football players likely can, and have afforded Steinberg. J.Bowlen violated his parole on several counts, but the court had failed to contact him, so Steinberg got him off. Now Bowlen has to keep his parole obligations in the future, or else he'll face more legal issues."
"Still drawing his full benefits from General status as retired military despite longtime treasonous acts against the nation.  The poster child for the modern, privatized military made up of officers' free education at West Point, Naval, and Air Force academies cranking out those fundamentalist christians as one requirement for promotion along with schemes to add to income through Military Industrial Complex connections.  All paid by taxpayers.  The failures to finish transpose into Republican politics to get elected to the AK legislature to rage and rant against all of those Natives, black/brown people, and heretics not following jesus dogma.  This feudal system needs a real restructuring and house cleaning of the embedded rot since privatization."
"I like how the article, apparently about marijuana use in the black community, transitioned into another commentary on Charlottesville and a critique of Donald Trump."
"so other than governing while black, what made Obama a racist and a thug?"
"DB, Exactly. What happened to forgiving? If we take the approach of not allowing officers because of the past we would never get over anything. We should hate Germans still. We would hate Japanese etc......get the point? The police have made great strides and should be applauded rather than punished. I am starting to feel that this is no longer the group we know as Pride but rather a division of Black Lives Matter."
"I'm not a supporter of Zionism, that's for sure.

"John, I am sure you will be quite glad when you get rid of all the Chinese, Black, and Muslim colonists too."
"My guess(educated)... the young black man/men sometimes have trouble assimilating into the island way of things. A gang banger won't get much respect on the street from local types especially south pacific islanders with the same skin tone. I'm thinking the young black man was disrespected recently, and was forced to retreat because numbers were not on his side. He returns to the scene, with an AR, and randomly fires into a crowd, most of which probably had nothing to do with the shooter's current mood. Typical behavior of an east coast city cretin. Cowardly weasel move. Some people should not be allowed to breed."
"Why should people not resist an illegal arrest, supposedly because the court system will straighten it all out, that's really funny. Cops plant evidence, lie in their reports and are usually ""investigated"" by their buddies, prosecuters want to stay on the good side of the people that keep them busy and look at how the courts have allowed almost any scenario by cops doing illegal searches and seizures. Will this Utah cop be prosecuted, how about the three other losers that knowingly allowed him to make an illegal kidnapping. 
Why did Watt's burn, an inebriated Black man ran so the cops put a rope around his neck and kicked and beat him, then got off. What about Gray, he ran and the cops killed him, they all got off. Why wou;ld any Black male submit to arrest when you can go on utube and see any number of handcuffed guys being kicked and beat. Not in AKyousay, how about that legless man killed at a pullout on the Kenai, now a fellow in Seward dead by cop. Only rich people will ever get"
"Understood.  Like I said, I am far from convinced that if the KKK or whatever they want to call themselves, could get away with lynching, they would.  And for the sake of argument, who's to say when some black guy goes as a missing person down in the deep south, he didn't just get lost in the bayou."
"If this judge had made such awful comments and decisions based on prejudice and stereotypes regarding a Black or Jewish victim - he would be off the bench by now, and rightfully so. A defence of 'ignorance' and that he did not know it was wrong to operate on his prejudices (and in this case perceiving the victim as the accused) might on a human scale be a good thing for Mr. Camp, but does not qualify him to remain as a judge.To allow him to do so would be a mockery of justice and our judiciary."
"Aren't you embarrassed for having to resort to repeatedly censoring my posts to hide your proven untruths? I believe that your comments reveal a somewhat racist and colonial attitude to people of colour like me, who don't have your 'sense of content' or 'taste'."
Trump isn't black.  He is a fascist buffoon though.
"""The real issue is the relationship of social status to decency. There is no such relationship. It is not elitist to respect Muslims and Mexicans and African Americans and women and immigrants and Jews, and a blue collar is not a moral pass. A college education is not a requirement for, nor a guarantee of, a moral compass: There are educated members of the American elite who spectacularly lack one, such as the man who was elected president Tuesday. And there are “poorly educated” Americans who abundantly express kindness and solidarity for Americans unlike themselves.   Neither the elites nor the masses have a monopoly on qualities of character. But Trump’s American vision despises people at the top and people at the bottom. It is an inclusive vision."""
"EE: Indeed, ""racism"" is not a crime...it is not illegal.  When it becomes manifested in actions which discriminate  or cause others to fear for their personal safety, it may, indeed, ""become"" a crime.  

We saw millions of racists come ""out from the shadows"" when President Obama was elected.  Suddenly, it because ""fashionable"" to post racist comments on the internet...entire websites were created just for such posts....Indeed, it is protected ""free speech.""  Disgusting, deplorable, dispicable perhaps, but certainly protected free speech.  Sure, it's legal for folks to wear 'blackface"" and mock AfricanAmericans.  Sure, it's legal for kids to tell Latino kids ""hey, get ready to be deported""...""hey, pack your bag.""  Indeed, with the election of Donald Trump and with the racist and xenophobic comments he made during his campaign, we will now see increased ""license"" to emulate those comments.  Racism is ""alive and well"" in America today.  I find that very, very sad......Gary Crum"
"Clearly you are not familiar with Everson, if you claim that there is nothing wrong with a governmental official preaching Christ while in his official capacity. The very real wall between church and state forms the basis for Justice Black's majority opinion in Everson.

"You totally missed the point.  If you read all of my posts you would full well know I have no issues with protests.  Reading would be very good for you.  You again just proved why protesting the National Anthem is the wrong way to do these protests - YOU don't even know that players in Seattle are protesting for Black power.  You should see the problem here.  Nobody knows anymore what anyone is protesting about (YOU didn't even know about this latest protest).  Go ahead and protest the National Anthem...as long as you know your protest message will be lost in the shuffle (unless each player wears a sign on them saying what they are protesting for).  Sure, it's 100% legal to protest during the National Anthem...but 100% the wrong way since they only muddy up their issue and have it get lost.  Kap protested for Police brutality against Blacks yet nobody is talking about that - they were before he protested the National Anthem though.  Now it's about the National Anthem...not the Police."
"With enthusiastic community support, the city of Eugene fittingly passed a resolution declaring the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Why? Because Columbus Day represents the brutal genocidal ethnic cleansing of the Americas.

Yet what was our community's response to University of Oregon's ""Israel block party"" where the brutal genocidal (still ongoing) ethnic cleansing of Palestine was not condemned but celebrated? How can Arab or Muslim or Palestinian students feel safe at our university when UO-affiliated Jewish organizations hold a ""block party"" celebrating the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine and promote the IDF? What would it take for our community to understand that Palestinians, including refugees, might feel the same way about the flag of Israel that Blacks might feel when they see the Confederate flag or that Jews might feel when they see the Nazi Party flag? Has allegiance to Israel, a country that bans return of refugees it has created, replaced theology?"
"^^^
Fully agree... somewhat shocking to read just how little people know about history, especially the notion that the plight of the Native American population is somehow insignificant compared to the treatment of black people...  something which smug Canadians and Americans, who are quite happy to tsk tsk those in the American South, really need to sit back and think about."

"Seriously, Again?

How in the name of all that's sensible can this woman ever be trusted with classified top secret information?
Scandal follows her everywhere she goes and the dishonest establishment media just glosses over all of it...Debbie got fired and her termination turned into a promotion even after all those DNC staffers were caught planning to distribute propaganda, slander and lies against Bernie and Trump.
They used racial slurs to refer to Hispanics and Blacks and plotted to use Bernie's faith or lack of faith against him plotting to stir up a rift with Southern Baptists.
These people are dirty lying rotten scoundrels who operate like this 24/7
yet the dishonest media winks it's eye and turns it head as if nothing ever happened.
Apparently Socialist Liberal Democrats not only ignore the security of America as it relates to Islamic Terrorism they also seem to ignore Cyber Terrorism"
"Who fired the first salvo?  So, in lala land its OK for a black social justice activist to smear somebody, but not the Donald?  Let's get real here.  Good for Trump."
Wonder how many of the loudest protesters in Black Lives Matter are paying the thousands of dollars for a game seat?  Prices are going to go way down real soon.
"Denise, I'm sure if we traced your ancestry back to the generations of Hindu East-Indians in the 17th century, we'd encounter people participating in the Hindu caste system. The caste system was quite normal at that time.

"America has a president who encourages violence and denies the obvious reality of climate change.  To teach students to think, you have to teach them how to differentiate between truth and lies and that's no simple task when the President and governing party habitually embrace falsehood under the banner of 'alternative facts,' and 'fake news'.  I do congratulate the author on managing to  avoid using the world ""fascist' until the last line ... alas, that last line is just the kettle calling the pot black.  I tend to think attacking people for their religion is fascist ... demonizing an entire nation by calling them 'muggers and rapists' is fascist ... urging that innocent family members of terrorists be killed is fascist ... the list could go on, and on, and on.  The educational process would have a lot more success teaching students to think if the country's leaders would set an example ..."
"the urgency from Ms Klein about a world not heeding her sage advice on how best to order itself, born out of her deep personal experience in politics, industry, business, science, or even so little as the building of a better mousetrap, comes, one can't help assuming, from her growing recognition that she may very well pass from this earth before her own particular rebranded style of collectivist nonsense gets another chance at destroying the lives and aspirations of so many many people....driven by a deep self proclaimed love of mankind mind you...it always is , 

When Ms Klein re-Tweeted, on the occasion of her hero, Hugo Chavez's death :  “Yes, the Venezuelan president could be a strongman. But he leaves behind what might be called the most democratic country in the Western Hemisphere.”...you might question her skills of assessment against the fact that Canada is in the western hemisphere...how is Venezuela doing these days anyway..maybe someone should ask Ms Klein in an interview"
"I am sorry you believed he did not care.  I am sorry you do not realize our economy has recovered faster than most any other in the world from the recession in progress when he was elected - things are tough all over.  
I guess YOU didn't care about all the people without health insurance that have it now, but he did. I am sorry you had no idea that before the ACA, health care costs were driving this country bankrupt, and since the ACA health care costs per capita have come down.  
I am sorry you voted for a congress who blocked our majority-elected President in every way and even put our economy in jeopardy by not passing a budget, just because they hated the black man.
I am sorry that you liked having such a large portion of our precious young men overseas fighting in wars that New Orleans drowned because even the National Guard was in Iraq.  Obama brought them home and put down Osama Bin Laden, but I guess you don't care.
Which Americans in particular did he not care about?"

Now, do you want to address the substance of my post or continue, in typical liberal fashion, to cling to a small or irrelevant claim in my post that does not affect the substance of the argument?

I hope not!

But art and music these days, including art coming from Asian and African countries, seem to have borrowed quite a bit from western culture, as they have been globalised.

Should our schools be giving students a sense of what art and music from around the world are like? Sure.

But should Canadian schools be teaching students  how to make Bollywood movies, or play Chinese instruments? No. There are other places they can learn that better, if they wish."

Beside we've be told all this harassment of women is a private matter, between a husband and wife. Twenty years ago, women were bimbos, and it was said, that all a man had to do was walk though a trailer park with a dollar bill. What about all the CLAIMS, women made of Bill Clinton, at the time, not thirty years later? What's changed? Harvey Weinstein's behavior over thirty years, interesting. A rich powerful man, noted Democrat, noted donor to Democrat candidates. And what's groping? Is is like racism, any criticism of a selective blacks is now racism. If a women backs into a the hand of a rich power man and the hand touch her rear, is that now groping? Or if the rich power man touches period, it that now groping?

Let's have a frank and honest assessment of what happened to the land which actually has been transferred to previously disadvantaged people. We pay our taxes so that it can be used to uplift society and the poorest, but all I see is how it is stolen and ends up in Dubai and Saharanpur.

And while we're at it, let's have a discussion about how before European colonisation there was african-on-african colonisation. Do people really think that Ubuntu was at the heart of the expansion of the Zulu kingdoms?

Our universities deserve to be knocked down a peg or two."
"Flashback, 2008:  A republican president drives the country into a ditch, and in the midst of the ""War on Terror"" a black man named Barack Hussein Obama is elected POTUS by wide margins.

In response, the republican party opens the flap on the Big Tent to the seedy underbelly of American politics, the racist far right, fueling a cultural backlash that gives them both houses of congress. 

2016:  A lame and entitled democrat tries to carry the banner for women into the oval office and fails.  Her opponent slides to victory in the EC espousing ideals popular with the racist right:  A border wall and a muslim registry, both of which are hooey...

"You aren't seriously claiming that blacks and Hispanics aren't Christians, are you?  They probably don't wear it on their sleeves as much because it would expose their hypocrisy, particularly with regard to abortion.

"The US conducts false flag attacks, bombs sovereign countries for oil, and sends not-yet-proven-guilty ""terrorists"" to black sites around the world to be tortured. If we have no qualms dealing with America, then we shouldn't have any about China other. The hypocrisy is already evident in that our second largest arms consumer is Saudi Arabia.

"Thankyou for this superb article about Fr Orobater.  I had the opportunity to hear him speak at a Theology Conference in Chicago a few years ago, and more recently when he spoke at a Woman's Conference in Rome.  I seem to remember him saying that he has 22 siblings, since his father had many wives.  It is so refreshing that he has a wholistic view of life, which he got from his deeply African culture.  I hope the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church are listening.  It is really difficult for those indoctrinated with the Adam and Eve story, where woman is an accessory to a man from the beginning, to unlearn that myth and see the wholeness of God's Redemptive Plan, by accepting the more likely scenario as also found in the Book of Genesis, where God created woman and man at the same time and as EQUALS IN GOD'S IMAGE!  God's Plan has been frustrated from the beginning, probably partly because of cultural issues, in my view.
Sincerely,  Dr Rosemary Eileen McHugh, MD, MSpir"
"Your comment was meant to compare DU30 to Hitler not just that they were both elected.  Obama was elected as was Trudeau are you going to say they too could have or will become dictators?  The analogy does not hold water.  My original reply was to a post that said He IS a dictator which of course he is not .... 
I have read plenty of your comments to know what side of the political spectrum you are on so saying ""I have voted for blah blah blah"" is akin to when a democrat says he cant be a racist because he has a black friend.  
If you think I cast my vote in the last election for Trump, you would be spot on ... He is not HRC and that in it of itself was enough, but beyond that the promise to appoint conservative Justices (which he has done) and repeal the monstrosity of Obama care were enough for me to vote for him, all his other faults not withstanding."

"Was Hillary really the first woman to be nominated for president?
It seems like such an old story. 
Firstly, there was Geraldine Ferraro, in 1984 the first woman nominated as a Vice-President. She lost in a landslide.
  Second, when America and the world were very ready for a leap forward, Hillary lost the nomination to a black man.
  Third Hillary's been in the news almost every day for 25 years. 
    Fourth, Hillary's been at the top or very near the top of the power chain for a quarter of a century.
  Fifth, ""Dynasty"" was a TV mini-series back in the 1970's that featured ruthless, wealthy, corrupt women fighting for power. In 2016 Hillary seemed redundant."
That report was retracted (probably because it included statistics about black people) but if you aren't willing to admit they're the largest percentage of homicides based on population in Alaska then you're the one who won't look at facts.

He doesnt suffer fools wisely; particularly 45 supporters and their pretzel-ing attempts at justifying everything/whatever he does; generally plays by the rules, if there are any - will let 45 defenders talk without interrupting and will not allow them to interrupt/filibuster him, which seems to key strategy in their playbook on talking heads shows.   This of course makes him persona non grata among 45ers.  Personally, he reminds me a bit of James Baldwin.  Not sure about the birds of a feather remark, maybe start with they're both black? (LOL)"

"What I've found with most of the partisan sites, including the one you posted, is that they generally let you know only part of the truth, the parts that support their bias.  What they say may be factually correct, but hardly ever the full story.  Ex.  How many blacks were lifted the middle class through affirmative action, including men like Colin Powel.  How many children didn't starve because of poverty programs.   I'm not ignoring the dismal failure of leadership in some cities, but it's not the whole story.  

What partisan writing leaves out is more telling, than what they put in the article.     

*Being an ex Democrat, I can tell you that I become an independent after I started looking at the Democratic party with the same critical eye I used for Republicans.  There's a list of party policy that disappoints.   

In fairness, Republicans are even weaker in most of the areas's that are important to me.   That doesn't let Democrats off the hook.  

It's bad policy vs no policy."
"Read the article and found myself questioning the constant reference to African Americans instead of the South Asian American communities in the derogative ""Ghettos"".  Putting down one ethnic group to elevate another is not what the article was to be about or was it? That the Blacks such as those living in another country, under different social oppressions and living in a state of poverty  deserving to be associate to the term you first stated carries a negative connotation? It is my understanding that there is a large population of South Asian peoples living in ""Ghettos or Slums"" in India than those American Blacks that your refer. It is not necessary to defer the use of this word upon any minority group in order to convey your point. It is a word that can be removed unless referred to the state representatives or government that neglects to proper service the needs of the forgotten community. Communities of willing and hardworking citizens. Brampton is not a Ghetto. It has issues."
Just imagine if they were wearing body cameras.... this story would have been twisted in so many ways. I've been stopped because of plate readers not pinging to a matching vehicle before. Technology is not 100%. The officers were fair and courteous.  blue lives matter // black lives matter // all lives matter // it doesn't matter. the first rule of law is that no one is above the law.

"Both the researcher and Wente assume that the answers people gave to the question they were asked meant they felt they hadn't been discriminated against. But the question was, “In your day to day life, how often do you feel you have been treated with less respect or courtesy than other people?” it's perfectly possible that, say, African Americans or other people of colour might have taken it for granted that all people like them would usually be treated with little respect or courtesy, so that there was nothing unusual in the disrespect or lack of courtesy they were themselves in fact experiencing and taking for granted. As usual, Wente jumps to a big conclusion based on a tiny bit of evidence that is itself suspect."
Maybe that's what happened in the last election? We don't know where that dark money came from.
"How am I deflecting from Trump? You specifically said earlier,
""Actually, no, they don't. I don't recall any incitements to violence at Democratic campaign rallies.""
So I brought up how Hillary For America, a Hillary Super PAC, was caught funding mentally challenged and homeless people to instigate violence from Trump supporters by standing near them, insulting their family and children, etc. until they got a physical reaction (imagine going to a black neighborhood and shouting racist things, you would get your ass kicked) or actually paying rioters to start chaos at Trump rallies such as in Chicago.
Please refute my points with logical returns, not ""Russia Drummmpfff IMPPEEEACH"" nonsense."
The red states did everything in their power to deny black folks the right to vote. That includes limiting voting locations where many black folks live.
"My daughter has been at EWS for 3 years and it has been a really positive experience.  While limiting screen time is encouraged, I know there are families with screen policies across the spectrum at EWS. Some families have no screen time at all while others go see movies regularly and have iPads for their kids. Parents are trusted to make the best decisions they can for their families. My daughter uses black crayons at home (because sometimes you just need to draw a black cat or a spider!) and reads chapter books (she's 8 years old). She has celebrated Rosh Hashanah before because a couple students in her class are Jewish and the parents wanted to bring in latkes for everyone, and it's really a very multicultural and tolerant place where all the world's faith traditions are learned about. In my experience it is very forward-thinking in that regard. Our daughter is happy there and learning lots—intellectually, socially, physically. It's a good place :)"
"Shame, indeed!  But Christians don't think laws apply to them.  You know, ""religious freedom"" and all.  ""Render unto Caesar. . . ""  Oh, never mind."
Oh cut the disingenuous far-right talking point. The Democratic party of the 1800s has no bearing on the Democratic party of today. Neither does the Republican party. What DOES have relevance is ideology. Slavery was undeniably a conservative institution. Conservatives went to war to preserve their right to own and oppress other people. Conservatives left the Democratic party in droves over the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. The modern day Republican party is made of of the very same people that left the GOP over the notion of treating black people with respect. Ever hear the term Southern Democrat? That's the modern GOP.
"Congress: “Get ready to do your job”.

"The facts are that BLM does NOT promote violence.   You are simply wrong.   Some people who showed up at some of their protests did commit violence.  BLM themselves never did nor did they call for it.   

You wouldn't want all cops to be painted with a broad brush when one of them shoots an unarmed citizen in the back, would you?   Assuming you wouldn't, I must ask why you are doing the same with BLM.

Is it because they're black?

I have done nothing but condemn violence in this thread and yet you have repeatedly accused me of endorsing it.   You obviously live in your own alternate reality and are immune to reason.

LOL at ""alternate forms of enlightenment"".   Is that like the alternative facts that Kellyanne Conway speaks of?   Maybe like that time MLK murdered all those people in Bowling Green?

But I still maintain that Mr. Pitts (with whom I disagree as often as not), wasn't taking the position in his article that you've ascribed to him, per your above post.  I believe he was arguing that those who decry injustice usually serve ""truth, justice and the American way"" better than those who denounce them for doing so.  I agree with that.

There are too many knee-jerk attempts to drown-out dissenting voices by reviling rather than refuting said voices' arguments.  Such as shrieking ""RACIST!"" when someone has the temerity to question police-actions against black folks OR express criticism of a particular political leader 'of color', ""ANTI-SEMITE!"" when someone criticizes ""Israel's"" mistreatment of Palestinians (who are Semites, BTW) or ""HOMOPHOBE!"" when mentioning that some gay-rights activists' claims lack scientific basis."

This instructor had far more to say, as well, that is controversial. 
Taken in context, the word easily can be understood to be aggressive, demeaning, and insulting. 
Accountability has nothing to do with tenure; deans and others have ways to spur instructors if they're loafing. The critical question is independence. This war on tenure is nothing but another rabid right assault on progressive institutions, in this case, universities."
"I find it shameful that a political organization like the AFN would so blatantly seek to exploit the pathos associated with a dying man.

Political exploitation of a dying celebrity is nothing new. Remember the parade of African National Congress members trying to cash in as Nelson Mandela lay dying?"
"The Articles are now treated in Anglicanism as historical statements only, and with the possible exception of Sydney Aus. (deeply evangelical) and a few places in Africa, hold very little purchase.

A gazillion RC worldwide take communion regularly, and couldn't explain the dogma if a billion dollar prize was on offer. I suspect many of them would not affirm it it if they knew about it, in any case yet we are called upon to affirm it?  Besides it is one explanation for Real Presence, not the only one."

"Thank you for your reflection, Sister Joan.  As an Afro-American Catholic Christian woman, I was astounded and saddened to read on NCR's website that 32% of Catholics support Trump.  Support for his ignorance, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia indicates a disconnect from Catholic social teaching.  What is clear is that our country will thrive with a qualified female president, and begin to take care of our climate and planet, and remove the structural economic inequalites wrought not by free trade, but corporate tax avoidance and tax breaks for those with high earned and unearned income.  The culture has moved beyond what Trump (and the US bishops) represents.  I am hopeful, even though I never thought the voting rights battles of the 60s would have to be refought.  Peace and all good."

"The pardon of Arpaio was motivated by the same Republican spirit of hate that gave us Reagan’s embrace of “state’s rights” in Philadelphia, Mississippi, the Willie Horton ads and the McCain-Palin rallies. It was motivated by the same spirit of hate that fueled anti-Latino rhetoric on right-wing radio. In fact, it would not have raised an eyebrow if any other Republican who won the presidency in 2016 pardoned Arpaio, the perfect symbol of the prejudice and scorn Republicans have embraced ever since Barry Goldwater gave the finger to black and brown Americans by opposing the 1964 Civil Rights Act."

"Here in Eugene, we have witnessed the reality of how the lynch mobs worked in days of old.

If we allow religious beliefs to permit discrimination in the public markets where goods and services are traded, we will have chaos and we will slowly divided ourselves again into groups who use economic power, the ownership of shops, restaurants, inns to reinforce whatever form of segregation the majority want.

She was in costume as the author, promoting the book of the author...hardly gestures of any disrespect...but showing unawareness of how easily, and quickly and vehemently, such demonstrations can be misinterpreted and politicized.

This reminds me of an incident from several years ago, in which a high school teacher used the word ""niggardly"" in a lecture, to which a black student took offense and complained to the administration and media...the teacher was pilloried...and perhaps forced to resign, although memory isn't clear on that part."

"The southern democrats ruled the Old South before the Civil War, and it was the democrats who intimated black republicans, after the war. Is that also part of the southern history that should be forgotten as well?  It sounds like your ""culture of institutionalized racism"" came from your own party.  

 From Wikipedia on the Old South:

The ""Old South"" also refers to the tradition of Southerners voting the Democratic ticket. During the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, black people exercising their right to vote for the first time led to a Republican South until 1877, when southern Democrats returned to power due to intimidation of black voters and laws that suppressed civil rights. 

As more middle class and educated Republicans move to the south from other areas of the country and white support for segregation and racist policies subsided, the south began to shift to the Republican party starting with Nixon winning a few southern states in 1968."
"This just isn't bright whatsoever. I don't have a lot of love for the New York Times but sadly I'm sure that they asked these meatheads if they could run a story and these fools jumped at the chance. 

Why? What on earth would of made them think that this story would come out favorable? You're running drills in the backyard complaining about health care while you cough up blood and refuse to see a doctor? Come on now. 

Sighs and oh it's not a racist organization because they have 1 black member. Face palm. 

Just the most ridiculous story I've read all day.  No one is coming for your guns.  If anything it would be easier to napalm you than for the govt to want to send anyone in for your guns (realistically speaking) and no muslims are going to hop out of the woods shooting folks, geez."

.... clear case of Racial Profiling By the Police!  =:-o   (By damn, it doesn't get much worse than that!)

Oh, and on the 'no excuses' meme, here is a very interesting academic paper from the early Obama years with some pertinent examples of how many *black Americans* were saying it was 'no excuses' time for ... black Americans.  ;-)   The scholars frankly concluded that in fact, black Americans still had plenty of excuses for personal failure (although they had to employ a lot of rather weak ""yeah - but!"" arguments, in my view).  :-/   I'd be interested on your take of this (also shared with Mr. Skeexix):  http://web.utk.edu/~blouis2/files/No%20More%20Excuses.pdf

Thanks for your words."
"Is it racial profiling, or making a decision based on dress and demeanor of the person?
As a person spending lots of time in downtown Toronto it didn't take me long to be able to pick out the gang members from the general population.  
Dress, attitude and language says it all and I am not talking just about black gang members, I am talking about all gang members.   The only issue is distinguishing between real gang members and poseurs.
BTW, who actually takes anything the Ontario Human Rights Commission seriously?  They are in the business of discrimination."

"Ras·ta·far·i·an

adjective
1.
relating to a religious movement of Jamaican origin holding that blacks are the chosen people, that Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia was the Messiah, and that black people will eventually return to their Africa.
noun
1.
a member of the Rastafarian religious movement. Rastafarians have distinctive codes of behavior and dress, including the wearing of dreadlocks, the smoking of cannabis, the rejection of Western medicine, and adherence to a diet that excludes pork, shellfish, and milk."
"The statistics in Heather MacDonald's "" The War on Cops"" disprove the entire media narrative on Police brutality and the Black Community so I don't even believe in the cause, but even if it was a noble truth based cause, there have got to be better ways to raise awareness of it than refusing to stand as required by NFL rules and basic decency for the American anthem. It is disrespectful and totally ineffective. How is pissing off MILLIONS of Americans creating allies for their issue?"
"""If Trump opposed racism, he would hardly be calling for the firing of black athletes who take a small symbolic step to protest racial violence against people of colour""
He did't. He said ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that SOB off the field right now, out, he's fired""
YOU'VE decided to make it about BLACK athletes. Add an extra word here, an extra word there - as long as it supports your narrative, right?"
"So Trump brought up perfectly valid issues, and many jumped on it. 

And Cruz got pretty far in the Republican race, despite being part Cuban. So i fail to see your point.

If Bush's team in fact did that, it was indeed disgusting tactics. But having a ""love child"" at all might have been more important to a conservative electorate than it being black. Otherwise, would not the fact he had adopted a Bangladeshi child be just as much of a turn-off?"
"This is a plan doomed for failure that will keep organized crime in the cannabis industry. First, the quality of product from LPs does not measure up to that produced by the cottage industry. Clients will know this and opt to get their cannabis from cottage growers.  Second, even the government of the day back in the prohibition era understood thy could not control the manufacture of booze, which is why they set out standards then allowed private enterprise to handle production. 
Third, the issue of disease. Large LPs will spread bugs far and wide, whereas cottage grower infestations are isolate to the growers immediate clientele.
All this will do is keep the black market thriving. Totally wrong headed plan."
"First, the man needs to think about what that flag stood for when he fought under it in Afghanistan.  Those people never intended to harm the US.  We started a stupid war with them and it is unwinnable and immoral at heart.   Too often we do good things in this country like letting people organize and fight for more help for poor people or more justice for many who are abused.   But we also do many evil things.  Jim Crow, keeping black kids in legally segregated schools, sending more resources to affluent communities while poor communities suffer(why don't you study Puerto Rico, the result of our arrogant colonialism and the people who suffer the results.)  

Second, the big issue here is that two major federal officials tried to stop free speech.   That is censorship and against our Constitution.  Far more important than a sports rule being broken."
"Excuse me, but the Republican party did not disappear over the last 50 years.  They ran against Democrats in all those races.    You blame the Republican failure to connect to urban black neighborhoods on the Democrats?   

Republicans lost, they lost miserably, they offered no policy, no example of how they could fix urban blight.  The only person I  heard address urban poverty in a meaningful was Sen. Jack Kemp and he never got a serious look by the party insiders.

I'm past sick of listening to the blame game.  We have One US Congress, One Executive Branch, One Supreme Court.     Like it or not The Parties are interwoven.  They are failing the nation because of their inability to overcome their self interest."
"Forgot about the punctuation. Also important to understanding. Many, many issues."
"@JP.....I hoping that you misspoke when you posted a comment regarding The Mims property, which is one of  the oldest black owned properties in Eugene.  You said ""A time when a class of citizens were discriminated against simply due to an accident at birth"". Being born black.....in my opinion, is not an accident at birth."
"I think you are pretty off-base here.    There is a deep history of city plans and policies doing systematic damage to a once-thriving black community in Portland.    That community was limited in their housing options and required to live in only one section of the city. It may not be significant to you, but it is to plenty of people who have a generational history here.       
It's not guilt that drives some to want to redress some of the historic wrong-doings but respect.    At least that's how I see it.     I find it ignorant of people who are not of a particular culture to sneer and deride a group of people that they don't even want to understand."
"Being black is tough. Being a woman is also tough. Two strikes  there. In the early 80's, as a petite blonde woman who chose veterinary medicine as a career, I can tell you that getting a job there wasn't an easy slog either. It didn't take me long to get over my my hopes to have a career in the dairy industry. It's funny how women can take a major role in the drudge work of farming, but that was only ok if you weren't being paid for professional services. Things have changed. I think a lot. ..... But I don't agree that there is a preference for people to choose associates who look like themselves. They  choose people who look like the people they grew up with and saw in those positions they are hiring for. After all I never met a Golden Retriever who much cared that the dog next door was a black lab. Afterall, you don't really see yourself. You see what's around you. Put another way, the more black female lawyers there are today, the more there will be tomorrow."
"Well, well well look at this. I'm taking the waiters side. I think this jackass is a lying low life looking to exaggerate his cause. This is typical black, racist, anti-American, slander."
"As an American with dark skin I want to know how much money does the Democratic Party pay you to mislead your own people? It is most evident that you are tearing down Trump to elevate Hillary Clinton.  Hillary Clinton, endorsed by the KKK, a recipient of the Margaret Singer award that hoodwinked Black Preachers to adopt the genocide of abortion because she saw the black population of unwanted weeds is a criminal and anyone who supports her must be likewise. You support Hillary Clinton who's state policy against Libya destroyed M. Gaddafi just because he was going to use African Gold to back a local currency to better all of Africa. You seem to be quiet as the Democrats are twisting in the wind to deny that their immigration policies are responsible for what happened in Orlando effectively throwing the LBGT community under the bus.

You are a sell out sir and you have no credibility to say anything about anything... Its time to cash your last check and go home......"
"Correct me if I am wrong, but didn't a lot of black people vote for Trump?  I am no Trump supporter and believe the only reason he got elected was because the best the Democrats could offer was Hillary, but Trumps message resonated with a lot working people of all races. 
Now I also find it disgustingly egocentric for Andra Gillespie to act as if she is speaking for all black Americans.  She isn't."
"If Obama ripped open wounds that were healing, then what is trumpf doing since taking over? Nada. He's just fanning more hatred by his tweets,really tweets and flip flop. I did remember trump said he would solve inner city problems. Nada. If fact Sessions is trying to withhold police funds from major cities. What a bunch of hypocrite swamp dwelkers. Remember when trumpf campaigned the African Americans he said "" What gave you got to lose?"" Lol. You guys go pick up a GOO slurpie at your local 711."
"The ages of rape victims in South Africa are from as young as a few months old to as high as one hundred years. It is almost routinely accompanied by excessive violence. Lesbian women are especially vulnerable. 

My moms' 85 year old friend was gang raped while being tied up next to her invalid husband.

It seems Jacob Zuma is the rule and not the exception. He impregnated the daughter of another of his closest friends. Zuma was the highest ranking official in the ANC's Department of Intelligence and Security- aka Imbokodo where the rape of young ANC members was rife.

"Hill spouts divisive commentary all day long. Whenever a black player commits a crime or is suspended, it's never because the player made a mistake or poor decision.  It's because ""America is racist and the system is pitted against black people"". She's awful and since her and Michael Smith ruined SportsCenter, they lose an average of 300k viewers a day from lead-in Pardon the Interruption (leading to the lowest ratings in SC history)."
"Thank you, Andersons.  Moreover, there is a great opportunity  here for cultural as well as natural features of the area to highlight.  As the EWEB Master Plan discusses, the home of Wiley Griffon, Eugene's first black homeowner, is located within the current EWEB employees' parking lot.  In connection with the Mims House-- second home owned by an African American,  up the hill at 3rd and High,  as well as   the site of the later ""Ferry Street Bridge"" neighborhood across the river, there is a natural triangle  here to honor the lives of Eugene's Pioneer African-Americans. 

So, while I'd have preferred  a City Hall location in the center of downtown, problems with other sites, plus the attractiveness here,  have shown that this EWEB riverside location may be best after all."
"Yes, by what authority does the UO administration impute meaning to Shurtz' attire or makeup? As does every other citizen, she retains the right to construe her appearance however she wishes. For instance, the president of the U. S. Is of mixed race. But he elects to define himself as a black man. It is the UO which has harassed Prof. Shurtz. It simply paid a private law firm to manufacture evidence."

"It's true, if the ACA is ""repealed and replaced"" - and that's still up in the air, I think - neither I nor anyone in the media nor anyone I have spoken to has a clue about what would replace it. I have read several columnists who say the repeal would be harder than most people seem to think. And indeed, if repealed entirely but not replaced with something at least as good, up to twenty million insured would immediately lose their health coverage. People are worried, especially those with ACA plans who have expensive pre-existing conditions. A lot of blacks and Muslims worry about a new wave of persecution. And there is much more that's up in the air. Millions of women marching against Trump do so because of the general disrespect he showed them. The Mexican peso is tanking because of worry about Trump yanking a lot of jobs out of Mexico, and charging Mexico for a 60 billion dollar wall, while returning 11 million unemployed Mexicans. People worry with good cause."
"Yes, and it was awful, unbalanced. The teacher droned on and on about the Trail of Tears and Tonto for months before spending another huge block of time on JFK and watching the Zapruder film endlessly etc...

I actually have a lot of respect for some native cultures and teach my kids the same. My daughter does quill work and used to wish she was native (which of course she is). We love us some ""Dream Keepers.""

That said, we are not big on one sided or revisionist history. I also love Allan Eckert's books like ""The Frontiersmen."" I have read far too many first hand accounts of atrocities on both sides to have sympathy for either. Sure I have empathy for both and can call good good, and bad bad, but I cannot pick teams in a losing game.

In Philadelphia a black man approached me once and said that he wanted to hang me. I asked why, and he stated ""that was what yall did to us."" I informed him that I had never hung anybody and in fact he had never been hung and we went on with life."
"You're the one who basically said any blacks who support the rebel flag down south do so out of stupidity.

Thomas  -  please tell us your plan for confiscating 300 million guns from legal owners.  Attempting that will only create a black market that disarms law abiding Americans and arms criminals.  Not a good scenario.
"The common thread is that Theocratic countries are down with murdering gay people. Nigeria is half Islam, 40% Christian, and 10% indigenous beliefs. I'm betting it is not the indigenous portion that let to the anti-gay laws, and considering Christian missions have been actively pushing anti-gay rhetoric in many African nations http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/world/africa/04uganda.html it is just as likely that they are responsible for the laws. 

The objective fact is Theocracies are never good for a given portion of the population. If the 1st Amendment didn't protect us from the the Family Resource Council and their ilk of ""Christianity"" we would also be a Theocracy on that list."
You need to keep up with the times.  These protests did not start because  someone open fire on cops.  Rather they started because cops gunned down innocent black youth for no valid reason except imaginary fear.  That is why there is a demand for cops to wear video cams.

"The deplorables are going to be sooooo screwed and even angrier within two years.   Social unrest in Merika is going to rival the late 1960's.  Trump will play them off against ""the blacks"" and other minorities and wring his hands with glee at the resulting distraction while he and his Wall Street misanthropes show everyone how to really plunder society.   Hang on to your hats folks and fasten your seatbelts, this is going to be the ride of a lifetime."
It would be nice to see a transgendered black Latina beat Trump in 2020.
"Trump appealed to folk's fear, anger, & nostalgia for the good ol racist, sexist days etc, (after a black president) but that is a different question than HOW he managed to get the vote. That, clearly, involved (in addition to collusion with the Russians) dividing the Dems.  Fact: Democrats HAVE more  voters and we could have won this with unity. Dems have to get smarter!"

And I NEVER 'play the victim'.  Being a victim is never ""play"".  I strive to keep myself and my family from BECOMING victims.

Being a ""victim"" means answering the door some night and being greeted by a uniformed creep who tries to keep the smirk off his face while he informs you one of your kids won't be coming home.  Does that sound like 'play' to you?

"We don't agree.  Political correctness is a sought after state that pleases the self-styled good progressive people.  Those who fall from the state of political correctness and shunned and treated poorly.  Being in the state of political correctness requires mouthing approved opinions.  We also disagree about what Trump thinks about blacks, women, Mexicans and Muslims.  You have never talked to him on these matters and you have essentially zero factual data to verify your beliefs.  You have been told these things by your favorite media personalities.  His beliefs will become evident as his actions accumulate."
"With all the problems in the black community, it is the issue of players kneeling that commands the attention of the NAACP."
"1. The electoral college system is plainly anti-democratic - its a system that permits election of the loser of the popular vote. That's the very definition of anti-democratic.

2. Google ""crosscheck."" Its a system set up by Republican operatives that matches last ad first names of registered voters in different states. The states then remove people from the voter rolls (in some cases without even  notifying them). So, ""John B. Washington"" in North Carolina gets removed because there is a ""John C. Washington"" in Indiana. The program disproportionately targets black people because of the commonality of some last names (i.e. inherited slave owner names).
Also, look at what, i.e., Wisconsin, Ohio, North Carolina, and various other red states have done regarding, i.e., number and distribution of polling places including number of machines at different polling places); availability of early voting, etc."
"You covered a lot, most I'm simpatico with though I think you fall well short of what's behind ""rebellion"", both collectively and individually. Though you no doubt mean well, you severely over generalize the motives behind individuals (black NFL athletes for example) actions, over simplifying and under estimating what there is to be angry about about this country. The individual reasons are legion, not just racial. Racism is just a free pass that allows our collective conscious to ignore the other root causes. I think MLK had it about right when he categorized our ills into poverty, racism, and militarism. I would add one more thing and that is runaway capitalism which serves as the life blood for this unholy triad. IMO it's actually greed, love of money and not money itself, that fuels rebellion at the collective level under the guise of proletarian values co-opted by different pirates who just want to get their piece of the pie  by feeding off of the commonweal carcass."
"Funny. It was leftist thugs who attacked Trump supporters in San Jose. ""GOP-created email controversy"" shows how deranged Ms. Henjum is. The racist extremists are bullies like Black Lives Matter (""Pigs in a blanket, Fry'em like bacon."" ""What do we want?"" DEAD COPS! ""When do we want it? NOW"") And who supports BLM? Why Mrs. Clinton of course. How many jobs has Mrs. Cinton created? Ms. Henjum is pretty close to the Social Justice Warriors at Trump rallies who, with spittle running down their chins, scream RACIST. Another other attempt at dialogue is impossible."
"Wasn't there an uproar some years ago when a Koran, at Gitmo, was flushed down a toilet? And isn't the Koran a symbol. The same side that called that DISRESPECT, is the same side that is now defending to actions of the players. The statement by the Broncos that this isn't DISRESPECT, of the flag, the military, or the police, is BS, if that's the case then why do it to begin with. And why do it during the National Anthem?

Can anyone explain how taking a knee, during the National Anthem, by rich professional athletes, many who have gotten out of inter-city black neighborhoods, help those in inter-city black neighborhoods? This is akin to all the ribbons liberals wore to show they cared more. But did one ribbons cure or make something better? And what exactly IS social justice? That everyone is treated fairly? If that the case why then are there protective classes? This action has always been about disrespect, not about accomplishment."

"Blackface is patently offensive? Are the letter signers sure that they want to stand behind that assertion? If they don't like her judgement, they just should not invite her to future parties. Officializing the outrage fodder list can only propel the in-group/out-group cycle. By the way, her intent does matter. Proof of that can regularly be observed in the non-persecution of black people who call each other niggers."
""" A military unit at maximum combat effectiveness is a military unit least likely to suffer casualties. Winning in war is often only a matter of inches, and unnecessary distraction or any dilution of the combat effectiveness puts the mission and lives in jeopardy.

It is morally wrong. [emphasis added]""

The simple fact of the matter is that Kap has not learned to dominate from the pocket...his skills have eroded and he wants to be paid like a starter. Period. He had trouble getting teams to commit to him BEFORE the protests. Think about it...the NFL is 80% African American. Are the owners stupid enough to black ball a player who was standing up for African Americans? If they thought they had protests before, what do you think would happen if that were the case.

If it goes this way and these kids are convicted in federal court,  I have ZERO sympathy for them and if the feds give them the death penalty, so be it.   With HPD ruderless and the former chief and his prosecutor wife up for numerous felony charges in federal court, the criminal element on Oahu has taken full advantage and rules of law and civility to the level of attacks and murder have become the norm.

"Chris Collins, talking about the protest, said he was amazed at the story players he played with went through to make it to the NFL. Collins said Vernon Davis told him,  they don't disrespect the flag they just want to be heard, and Davis said he'd like to talk to Trump, Davis plays for the Redskins. OK fine. Where are these stories of how blacks in the NFL made it. Why aren't black players going into inter-city black communities to sharing their story? The answer is, it doesn't fit the template. Most of the stories are of young black men, making it despite the government. Being more than they can be, working, committing to a dream, or a goal. Get the government involved and the work ethic and commitment decrease. What happens to government low income housing after a few years? Many of the players that kneel, made to the NFL because of themselves, not some government program, or hand out."

"Some other key difference between Zimbabwe and Zimbabweans and South Africa and South Africans:
-Zimbabwe is predominantly a rural country and a minority of pelople are urbanised in Harare and Bulawayo.
-Zimbabweans had the option of trekking down South when things got tough. South Africans have nowhere to go.
-Zimbabweans appear to be quite docile and accept a lot of manure. South ASfricans since the mid 1970's have a culture of protest and rebellion."
"The SPLC, the authority on hate groups in the U.S., puts KKK membership at as few as 5000 people out of  a population of 333,333,333. 

Your article is based on some lunatic fringe group representing some infinitesimal amount of 1% .
I'll bet there are more people who practice voodoo in Louisiana and voted for Obama than KKK who voted for Trump. 
Why not list some examples of what Trump is doing that is making this the worst Black History Month ever?
You've added your voice to millions that have expressed concern about the treatment of blacks in the U.S. How many people are advocating for the victims of racism in Canada's Atlantic provinces? Seems to me that if you are driven by genuine feelings of virtue you might want to be the first."
"I'm a race baiter!  Oh the horror!  I'm not the one that posted the link to a story about Black people rioting in a discussion about the 2A and gun regulation.

"The problem is not that a disproportionate amount of blacks are being killed, but rather that people are being oppressed and killed wrongly/illegally by police. The 4th amendment prohibits detainment, arrests, searches, even the request for identification (""papers""), without the explicit warrant based on wrong doing.  The 5th prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty and property, w/out due process.  Instead, police are trained, and implement being judge, jury, and executioner.  In their confused minds, they see the people as criminal and in need of such execution, without considering that people have the right to live without interaction with police, unless there is a warrant.  And even when there is, the police still have no right to kill (ie. deprivation of life) unless a death sentence has been handed down, per supreme law.  If the police feel threatened (and they will with their approach, as they threaten the people), they should take cover, and not murder.Bigots then get away..."
"I do not understand why making a statement in a quiet and dignified way ever suggests disrespect to the veterans. It is meant as a statement that the status quo about how minorities, but especially black people, are treated is no longer acceptable. Politicians have done little and these people are saying that needs to change and changing something requires bringing the attention of the public to the issue. I fully support what these athletes are trying to say and believe they are doing it in a positive manner."
"Let's see ABC/ESPN (owned by Disney) broadcast the1946 Disney classic ""Song of the South"" and watch them all go crazy!  These PC idiots will let black people say anything they want with no consequence and get rid of shows like ""Last Man Standing"" that was the 2nd highest rated comedy ABC had for no reason.

ABC should just play shows from the 1950s and 1960s like ""Maverick"", ""77 Sunset Strip"", ""Cheyenne"", ""Hawaiian Eye"", ""Surfside Six"", ""Combat"" and ""The Gallant Men"".  These shows were the blockbusters that made ABC network as popular as NBC and CBS.  Now days, Dancing with the Stars and Bachelor/Bachelorette shows are the best mind numbing waste of time that only idiots watch are broadcast on ABC.  I spend my time watching YouTube's old documentaries from PBS and the BBC during prime time hours, if at all.

Yeah Right.The current providers to the BC stock are just going to join this plan. The nickle & dime growers are not going to tell anyone what, where, or how they sell their product.

The only way the Feds/Prov are going to work this is providing cost effective and safe (iE tested) products."
"We also need to rename Lane County, then to meet your test of the past.  

He, according to the Oregon Blue Book, was a pro-slavery Democrat.   Even though he was one of our first two US Senators under a non-slave owing and non-negro residency Constitution. 

Can't name it after Lincoln or Jefferson, either.

"Where's their protest about all the murders committed by blacks??  Just in Chicago alone last year, 760 killed.  This year, 500 as of Sunday.  Close to 70 in one day over the Labor Day Weekend.  Where is their anger over that??  

One idiot (Kaepernik), gets demoted because he sucks, so the very next week he throws a tantrum under the guise of ""Protest"",  (Even though he NEVER said a SINGLE word before about ANYTHING ever before), and thereby starts this wave of ignorance & stupidity nationwide.

 - Black middle class, ""clever blacks"" as well as those who ran to the opposition will once again have faith in the leadership of the ANC.

Having said that, if he does become the President (instead of Whoopi Goldberg!!!), he will have a mammoth task of getting rid of all parasites.I hope he succeeds though and sort out the stae-owned entreprises."
That's all well and good but when it's all the blacks in the sports taking the knee and raising  their closed fist...remember the Black Power salute?...then it's them who are creating and dividing our country....it'll all end when they stop doing this crap...

"In a recent political speech, Hillary Clinton spoke about the Syrian situation in which she said she was going to enforce a no fly zone in Syria. But first, she would have a discussion with the Russians, who have already made it clear that they would shoot if the U.S. did that. So, Clinton would be risking a war with the Russians if elected President and enforced a U.S. no fly zone in Syria. What would Mr. Dion think about that? Enforcing sanctions, and going along with the U.S. on their Syrian policy. As for the Crimea, Russia took massive casualties there during WWII, but as Kruschev was a Ukranian, he gave the Ukraine status as an independent state, which resulted in the Black Sea fleet being based outside of the Russian federation, and to say the least, this was simply not acceptable to the Russians, and that is completely understandable for those with any appreciation of history. That would exclude Mr. Dion, who is incapable of rational thought."
"I recall black Eugene city councilor Greg Evans telling the Council, sometime in the last year, that he was fed up with the police stopping his son for no good reason.

I also note the continuing harassment of homeless people in downtown Eugene, also for no good reason. From Facebook:

Manly Hall Posted 8-6-16: This woman in the wheelchair and her caretaker have been living on the K. Plz. blocks for two months in the soft kill zone. Without shelter / decent food, constantly assaulted by the the general public, (dirty looks / snide remarks) sleep deprivation, and POLICE interactions. Oh and they are so polite to them (police) - but still, MOVE ALONG.

Now I thought Sheltercare came and got them. NO! WRONG! She was at Riverbend having her TOE removed! AND IS NOW OUTSIDE Starbuck's (K. Sq.) DYING IN THE SOFT KILL ZONE RIGHT NOW! GET IT?!?

"There have been those who actually looked at facts, rather than simply writing articles, and found that many of the tired old Republican ideas such as taxes, regulations and foreign policy actually matter to most people.  You are correct that the Republican Party was given a black eye in the form of Donald Trump but only time will tell what will actually be accomplished.
Washington and the Media are pretty much the only ones who actually care about gender, race, color and creed.  In the real world men and women work together and either earn their stripes or not.  Economic opportunity often is blocked by restrictive education requirements that can only be obtained from expensive colleges and provide little of value.
Once you have obtained that education and get to work you are blocked by quotas and regulations.  Look at the Pot Stores in Anchorage that are still waiting for approval.  In the meantime they are investing cold cash into rent, renovations, etc."
"A interesting article of a vast topic. I found this to be most concerning:
""Mr. Fillon was, until recently, regarded as the best hope to defeat Marine Le Pen, the extreme-right candidate who is politically and financially backed by, and is highly supportive of, Mr. Putin.""
Putin has access to tap into the profit generated by Russia's vast wealth. He has utilized enormous funds to buy the influence of western political leaders. In doing so, he has become the wealthiest person in the world has made the politicians he influences rich as well. He has been doing this for years as it is a long term strategy. The most recent story that seems to be dying out was his interference in the American political campaign. He is going after the Ukraine to solidify an age old Russian problem of its' border on the Black Sea. He and Trump want to end the problem of jihadist extremism.
To add, the European refugee crisis of 2015 contributed to these political conditions favourable to Putin and his money."
Yup. So stay far away from black males then.
"Depending upon what era film-makers need, not far from Vancouver there is...Victoria.

""Old Town"" Victoria, has streets full of one, two and three-storey brick buildings, circa 1870s-1890s, complete with cast-iron Bay windows (shipped direct from 'frisco.)  These streets were used for a little-known 1982 Canadian western (what other kind is there?) originally titled, Harry Tracy, Desperado (new title: ""Last of the Wild Bunch"")  Bruce Dern as Tracy, and, as one of the lawmen on the hunt for him--Gordon Lightfoot.  (True!)

Some scenes were shot in Cariboo Goldrush town of Barkerville, near Quesnel, BC.  Victoria (with earth-covered asphalt) stood in for 1900 Portland, Oregon.  Some of the chase scenes, through hip-deep water, in and out of overgrowth, were shot on Victoria's Gorge waterway, near Esquimalt's Banfield Park.

There's an entire downtown, virtually untouched since it was rebuilt after a catastrophic 1900s fire) in the Kootenays, near the BC/Alberta border, at ...Fernie BC..."
"C'mon Kurt, are you kidding us, right now?

""*Fire all your guns at once*""...and explode into space"" : anyone who's listened to *'Born to be Wild*' more than once since 1968 will tell you that the ""Guns"" they're talking about are rockets- not actual firearms.

And let's use some perspective, shall we?

Steppenwolf and *'The Pusher'* have been around since the 60's.  It's been emulated and covered by hundreds of other bands.  It's classic rock which at and through time have not incited a single mass riot, looting, and killing of police officers.  Any historian or someone over the age of 45 will tell you that in no way does drug use in the 60's equate in scope, depth, breadth, or magnitude to what it does in today's culture-- specifically in today's black rap culture.

To even compare these two things is like comparing, well, 'Starbuk' to Steppenwolf."

"“The gap in our racially divided country has never been wider.”  
Are you serious?
Never wider?  You do know that black codes and Jim Crow prevented Afro Americans from voting and many other things, right?  You do understand that segregation had a major effect on the Afro American development after being freed from slavery?  Our nation has in fact been more racially divided than it is today.

“Are we reverting to the '60s when police officers were often seen as the enemy?”  
Really?
You reference the 1960s and then ask if the police will have targets on their backs.  Do you know what was happening to Afro Americans in the 1960s?  As a former police officer I stand amazed at some of the actions taken by officers in the 1960s."

"Thanks for making it clear that you don't understand the issues. No one is protesting that stuff. 100% of shark attacks happen in water, but no one is protesting that. You must wonder why. You must also wonder why the Police Benevolent Association is not the American Heart Association. You must think that police don't care about heart disease. Earn your GED and learn that Kaepernick and the others are protesting the issue of their choice (freedom of America, right?), and that issue is dirty cops killing blacks. Period."

"I don't know if I would call it a boycott.   I would say that black voters didn't see either candidate as somebody who would listen to their voices.   

But very rationally, I think you're right.   They couldn't vote with the racial overtones of the Trump campaign and they just didn't like Hillary very much.    She is 'the system', black Americans wanted a friend.   We'd all like a President that shares our core values."

This was one of the first cases that ever dealt with this issue, and has seen it go to many different courts to verify the decissions made.

 So pay attention kiddies go to college get a job in finance and steal all of the money electronically and nobody will come and arrest you  especially the Anchorage Police Department"
As a black Trump supporter I find your comment extremely offensive.
Or the black lives matter or the Klan with a Tan group or the liberals..
Globalist governance you mean. Don't worry he may be cryogenically stored until he can be revived.
"Now that is true. I'm very negative on the abject lies about starving etc., but compared to the wifes of wherever,"" this place and that place"", especiallly the Rhode Island and Georgia.  I guess I'm a racist, these black women dressed to the nines, expensive everything, yet talk like they are in the Congo ready to chop arms off each other. As if  They are digging blood diamonds. If their forfathers had not been enslaved, they'd be on commercials with starving babies asking the world to feed them.  And by the way, light skinned black women are EXTREMELY PREJUDICED AGAINST DARKER SKINNED BLACKS.  THIS IS A FACT.  but, we all seem to covet, want to be known, all the haughty loooks these people give the camera, read Proverbs 6:16-19 God will deal with mankind without Christ in your life.  Hardest thing as a Christian is to learn to love everyone.  Not judging other people constantly, hate, wanting justice, these are my daily struggles. ORIGINAL KILCHER ESCAPED NAZIS, HE WAS REAL, NOTTHESE."
"Agreed, the black clad black shirted Fascists are far more intelligent, wearing hoodies and masks to cover their faces as they run riot , burn, damage public and private property, throw rocks etc., at policemen.

The brown shirts are National socialists ( Nazis) a different breed of totalitarian Marxists....the Reds, of course , are their socialist totalitarian cousins, the Communists.

Black= Fascists .
Brown = National Socialists.
Red= Communists.

"By all means. You are currently allowed to go to most any bar and smoke your stogies in their designated smoking areas.

"Maralyn, to say Trump supports racism is so wrong. If you look at his statements over many years you'd conclude just the opposite. On the other hand, do you recall Black Lives Mater chanting pigs in a blanket, fry'em like bacon""? The former President had BLM visit the White House. Cops have been executed. What did the former President have to say about the BLM riots?"
"Kag, it's Black Lives Matter who proposed the police be turfed, and the Pride Committee just agreed to it at their AGM. Of course, the Pride Committee isn't the LGBT community. BLM halted last year's parade for almost an hour."
"Absolutely wrong.  You would be correct if you wrote ""A Democrat who thinks of a Republican as a lowlife simply for being a Republican can not help but make a tainted article about a Republican. Much the same way as a KKK on Blacks.""  I know not a single democrat who would ever think of a republican as a lowlife just because they identify as a republican.  I realize that is anecdotal evidence and that there must be some democrats out there that would do that, but let's be honest with ourselves here.  Lastly, a ""tainted article""?  What is tainted about the piece?  If you mean bias, then you are still confused on what an op-ed is.  It would be fair to pick apart what Adrian Tam wrote based on substance, but it is unfair to critique someone for having an opinion in an opinion piece.  It would be like lambasting an encyclopedia author for only including objective facts."
So you believe he called to disrespect this family? Why because their black? I don't believe he said anything to be disrespectful I do believe this black Congress woman who hates Trump has convinced the mother he did though.  The hater needs to lose her job.
"Did anybody ask   police officers how many times a day / week/ month / year they have had, if not criminal encounters  but nerve wracking aggressive confrontations with  young blacks who resort to yelling, screaming and vulgar cursing,  spitting, fists raised,  that is out of step with normal behavior ?   No of course not."
"Scott Walker - There's nothing wrong with protests - Thomas Jefferson said they were as necessary in the political world as storms are in the physical - but that doesn't mean the ideas espoused by the protesters shouldn't be critiqued. When men who make millions of dollars a year for playing a game complain about the ""privileged"" lifestyles of their mostly middle-class fans, those being protested against have a right to object and even to counter protest. When Colin Kaepernick compared his potential employer to a slave owner, he brought his fate upon himself. He has no business whining about it now.

The objectionable part of protest is when it becomes violent, as it has with ANTIFA, Black Lives Matters and Rev Com. Frankly, when any group resorts to violence to ""prove their point"" that group and its ideals should be considered invalidated because entertaining their ideas only encourages further violence in hope of more compromise."

"Today the black gangs, the Asian gangs and the Hispanic gangs control the illegal drug trade.   They kill each other and the bystanders at random and to control their turf.  They also work the prostitution rings, of course.

"Hadiya Roderique, thank you for sharing your experience as a human being, a Canadian, a woman of colour. Throughout our lives I suppose many (most) of us feel we don't belong for any number of reasons. Your essay reinforces that it's naive for me to judge what your life is like - in the whole - by looking at your resume, a photograph, meeting you in a particular setting, knowing your family. As it would be naive of you to judge me. I'm sure I've made many missteps over the years, but strive to learn more every day on this planet. The tone of many of the comments here leaves me sad for humanity ... yet many readers connected strongly with your essay so I am also hopeful that honest conversation can provoke us to move forward."

Campus group Eradicate Boston College Racism organized the walkout after claims that the university did not properly address a recent racist social media post and the vandalism of two Black Lives Matter posters in residence halls, which were changed to read ""Black Lives don't matter.""  “It depends on faith, so that it may be a gift, and the promise (of racial justice) may be guaranteed” (Romans 4:16).  Despite what it may look like at Boston College, “The Lord remembers his covenant for ever” (Psalm 105:8a).  “`I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me (as did the walkouts at Boston College) before others the Son of Man will acknowledge before the angels of God” (Luke 12:8).

"Many on the left think that dropping the atomic bombs on Japan to end WWII was a racist act that would not even have been considered for Europe. The Japanese internment camps run by the US military are routinely characterized as racist. And there are those who fervently believe that the war in Vietnam was manifest racism. Should all statues and monuments to American soldiers therefore be removed?

Slavery was a universal evil that transcended almost all cultures and nationalities. It is still practiced in parts of Africa and Asia. Is anyone who fought to defend those countries more than several hundred years ago racist?"
"Padre Reese, the real question in these polls whether examining  RC voting or ""evangelical"" voting, is this: how do you define the terms? Take it from a non-RC, those ""evangelicals"" (by now a near meaningless theological term having been so stretched by the media) who overwhelmingly voted for Mr. Orange, rarely darken the door of a church. They are self-selecting in their description, having already attempted to monopolize the term ""Christian"".

We in a mainline church are a little easier to measure given our smaller numbers and cohesion. As to you RC, are the pollsters measuring any baptized RC, who is a cultural Catholic? Never at Mass, no check in the mail, in church when niece marries or when Uncle Vito dies, but otherwise never. If that is a Roman Catholic, then you folks are like our Jewish friends who can be agnostic but fully Jewish (well not in the minds of the black garbed ultra-Orth. but that's another story)."
"These laws like NC's HB2 are not about anyones safety but about further stigmatizing non passing trans people and encouraging violence against them.

"Seriously? Now you are gonna blame McGill for ""caving in"" to those bad tribal Quebeckers? 

Andrew Potter, to his enormous credit:
- admitted that most of his text was built around rhetorics instead of facts;
- apologized for writing such a terrible article.

As a result, he decided to step down not as a professor, but as head of the institute of... Canadian studies, of all institutes! Do I think he should have? It's irrelevant. He felt like he should, and it's not a crazy decision at all.

By the way, I think it is worth wondering whether those same people would also be so up in arms in the name of ""freedom"" of expression if in this Maclean's article, one would have read ""Muslim community or ""Jewish community or ""Black community"" instead of ""Quebec community"". Rightly, it would have universally been seen as a terrible, discriminatory piece. Generalizations and associations of this type are bad, that's as simple as that."
"In Canada, a predator taxi driver that does not speak English or French is  entrusted to safely transport vulnerable passengers to their destination. This could be a cognitively impaired young adult going to a class or a person out partying expecting a safe ride home or an elder going to an appointment. Someone as vulnerable as black out drunk, weather female or male, would reasonably believe a taxi ride home would be not put them in a position of physical, sexual or mental danger with this service."
"I salute the players that are protesting. I went to Viet Nam in 65, 66, and 67 for a war based on lies and I don't want to hear any crap about ""respecting the flag"" , etc. trump was a lying gutless draft ""avoider"". I have no respect at all for those who support him or his kind.  The protest started about injustice for black people,but I think now it's about trump and his gang of nazis."
"So what? The issue was racism against African Americans, remember?"
"I like the skills angle and yes in my experience and opinion that is the real problem. Business still needs to do the job they get paid to do. No point in enforcing black quotas when the job isn't getting done. I can get 10 black managers now but for my company they don't mean all that much. They can't really do anything except maybe if they are politically connected but those seems to be fleeting at best. So why employ a quota worker when I can source work to overseas companies and workers and bring the product back at a profit? Enforce your stick. It will mean more work for me. This here new South Africa can't do anything without consultants and contractors. One day the black taxpayers will wake up and realize they are paying 10x more then they should be paying and the government will tel then if was the mandate they gave to the government. Oh and another thing I have observed, government tends to chase away skills while promoting and rewarding inefficiency and incompetence."
"It would be great, really great, if we could keep this woman from getting her hands on the key to the cookie jar. But I sit here and sigh... we're probably already on an inexorable downhill slide to African Basket Case, despite our rhetoric and good intentions. And the sad part is that I'm too old and poor to get the hell outta here..."
Go black lives matter!

"Just ask  Asian Americans   if race relations with the black population is better now.   To many Japanese, Chinese, Korean Americans ,there is a race war being waged upon them , with violence,  assault, vandalism and nobody gives  a damn."
"His rebuke is not decried by me, for one. I am, however, looking forward to a similar rebuke from those who should be condemning the racist rants and the calls for violence against law enforcement by those professing to be members of Black Lives Matter."
"nonsense.
There was 10% unemployment when the black guy was inaugurated.

Now there is full employment 
............... and 80,000,000 Americans couldn't even take 6 hours off work to vote."
What does BLM have to do with this? BLM does not condone violence. They NEVER have. How about the cops the shoot minorities for no apparent reason. Like the recent shooting of a black man in Georgia.  That cop has been charged with murder. There are many more that should have been charged.
"It’s just a weird series of coincidences based on his not knowing any better that he hired a bunch of Nazis to his staff, won’t distance himself from the Klan, hired Kobach and Hans von Spakovsky and Jeff Sessions and his only governing principle is overturning everything President Black Man did.
Really, it’s sad because he just means well and is in over his head."

"I see the Confederate flags at Republican rallies. I don't think they are intended to make me feel like an equal American with Constitutional rights like the 2nd Amendment. Police shoot black folks for merely being suspected of owning a gun. The cops that kill unarmed black people get time off with pay. Us tax payers pay the settlements for the wrongful deaths, not the cops or the unions that defend them. I don't appreciate my taxes supporting murderous cops. All I want is equal protection  under the law. We have never had that in this country."
"I did not say only black athletes....there are plenty of under educated pro athletes of all colours......YOU are the one who made it about race....as are all the others who try to pigeonhole Trump supporters (really, just anybody but Hillary supporters) as racists. Fomenting."

"""There is something wrong in our country where Republicans believe it’s a right to own a gun but a privilege to have health care. None of that makes sense to me,” he said.""

I hope she immediately reported this threat to the authorities. What a knuckle-dragging cretin of a man.
"I left out an important clarification about the 7 Benghazi investigations.   They were all inconclusive, finally and summarily inconclusive.  But they were continually repeated, one after the other,  for their 'black-ops' value."
This stuff is really getting old. There is so much to say about this subject......I will sum it up the only racists I know are black.
"Im sure most homosexuals would say similar, that despite the cultural pressure to feel as you do, they felt the opposite or some shade in between.  May take some time for them to come to terms with it but all the LGB people I know felt the way they do ""from day one"". The myth that people ""choose"" to be LGBTQ is one of the most evil lies that is still commonly spread, it is the foundation of homophobia in Russian and eastern Europe as well as much of the Arab world.  It is akin to the anti-semitic tropes of jews and greed or money and similar.  

Freedom against arbitrary discrimination is one of the underpinnings of our society socially, politically, and legally.  To suggest that it infringes on a business owners right to free excersize or expression requiring them to serve LGBTQ people or to provide birth control coverage is just a re-run of the Jim Crow laws the southern states used to oppress black people for decades, the targets now are women and LGBTQ because...well, ignorance!"
"It doesn't matter. Communism/Socialism will never be ""applied properly"", because the people applying it are these black shirted anarchists and people exactly like them. 

Revolutionaries always become what they fought against once they get a taste of power. And then the famines start..."
"Actually, according to what I read on the web site of the Death Penalty Information Center, any federal prosecutor wanting to prosecute under the death penalty has to get ""personal written permission from the Attorney General of the United States. Apparently, this may be due to the ""seemingly racial bias""  in federal death penalty cases. The defendant in this case is not black but he is Hispanic. 
So, it might be Jeff Session whose has the final say if the prosecutor decides to go for the death penalty. 
Have no idea if this man had any prior convictions or if he is a pillar of the community. 
My guess is that they will not go for the death penalty. Of course, they might decide to make a ""statement"" about domestic violence (which would be great) and this case does fall under VAWA. That might be a way to ""say"" Trump takes violence against women seriously, political move? 
What do you think ?"
"More unsupported facts in support of a formulaic cut and paste attack.   The media  never had a problem with Obama and his support of Black Lives Matter,  or never questioned why Obama refused to say radical islamic terrorism.  The hypocrisy and selective moral outrage of the corporate media is sickening."
"The Kadhr family.... a shining example of the Canadian head up its a** thinking... a family living off the system - welfare, social programs, etc. while contributing nothing in return... father, mother, brothers, sisters... and killing people to advance their Islamic ideals.
I won't waste my time detailing all this... look it up yourself.... the whole bunch of them should have been deported/shipped out as enemies of Canada a long time ago, but as usual, the head up their a**es Canadian dolts actually support these morons.
So this dolt is getting expensive surgery and support for injuries he suffered as he was trying to kill Coalition soldiers - Canadian included - in that cesspool of Islamic hate in the Middle East.... perfect example of Canadian stupidity."
"How about a line for the total number of calories per package, in bold letters."
"Delusional! You live in a world of men woman! You seem to forget, along with the ANC that there is no physical barrier between you, your principles, your dreams and your enemy. When people feel they are being oppressed and abused, they will stand up against such. Yes there might be backlash in the form of a counter strike, but that does not matter in the world of men (in which you are just a woman, unable to realistically do anything when masculine cultures clash). Please understand this, you and all the woman out there that think they understand how humanity works. You will as surely as I be a victim when cultures clash in SA. Viva from the ANC or not."
"Eddy, would Jarred Kushner be destroyed if he were not a Jew....would Donald have been elected,  could you imagine Donald and Jared putting on a towel on their heads and going to mecca why doesn't Canada publish stats on black crime and Natives and drinking; how many Canadian Jews sign up for the Canadian military and go over to the front row, and how many of them have supported and chearleaded for our lower middle class Christian boys and a few girls to go over there and get killed and maimed, that is the ones hiding out in McGill and York....I could go on for ever about a dozen subjects like homosexuals and the spread of aids and the billions that it cost the health care system and these drug users tying up the emergency wards....but the press is too terrified to go there, like Eugene Melynk the owner of Senators, a Carribean tax avoider and a jump in front of the line liver transplant, but yet the city of Ottawa depends upon tax revenue....why does no one talk about those things."
"So in our Land of the Free, you want people forced to stand for the pledge and flag? Hmmmm. We are not equal, anyone who bashes the LGBT community is NOT a believer in equal rights. Equality for everyone, regardless of color, race or sexuality but nope, we preach hate and ban people from the bathroom they use based on their birth ""private parts"" - note PRIVATE parts - and not who they love their life as. Equality? Bullshit. Blacks. Women. LGBT. And now you want to punish the NFL financially because you disagree with one player. Wow. We have so hatred and disdain for anyone who disagrees with our beliefs. That doesn't seem like we value ALL people to me. Why don't you protest against companies that knowing hire sexual predators and suspected rapists? Refuse to watch swimming because of the Brock the Rapist? But nope, that's ok because Brock stands for the flag and Colin Kaepernick  doesn't. Good to see your values are in the right place."
But it is OK for Black Lives Matter ??
"Shooting black kids with toy guns in a playground is what the American police does, right?

We could make this inane comparisons forever. What I do know is that you have never been to Saudi Arabia or Dubai. Your endless knowledge about those places comes from a very small base."
"You gotta love the bias here. Trump picks an extraordinarily gifted black man who saves the lives of LITTLE CHILDREN to look over the housing of those less fortunate in our society and the media want to portray him as a loser because...drum roll please...he has no experience in government! If Carson knows how to re-start a child's heart, he can figure out how to restart a fat bloated bureaucracy. And then they talk about his kooky christianity while at the same time want you to let in Syrian refugees who have been religiously persecuted.

The left is so wetting the bed and it is beautiful to see!"
"There are many more women in our society who deserve praise other than Hillary.  Recognizing her for achievements for women is like recognizing Bill Cosby for black men, Sarah Palin for soccer moms and Donald Trump for hairstyle.  Being well known person should not be confused with an outstanding person of character and accomplishment."
"Them your logic allows businesses in public accommodation to refuse service to anyone for any reason, and it's well established in law that such discrimination is not a right or businesses would be able to refuse service to blacks.

That means you just lost this argument."
"Like I've been saying, Trump is not a racist with a Jewish son in law, convert daughter and Jewish grandchildren. Along with a black friend Dr. Ben Carson.
Honesty? Who is the bigger liar, Hillary or Trump? I will say Hillary."
"How is taking a statue down pretending the civil war never happened? Most of those statues weren't even put up at the time but decades after the c.w., at times of racial unrest; it was less about honoring than in telling blacks, you need to be kept in your place. Never understood this glorification of what they call the ""war between the states"" in the south; they lost. When I was in high school a German exchange student asked why there were confederate statues, since they lost the war. I had no idea. We asked my father, and he said people that supported that kind of stuff just weren't very smart. Makes me think of what some folks tell Clinton supporters: ""You lost. Get over it."" Clearly, many of them still haven't. Embarrassing."
"I suspect the upheaval resulting from the black face episode is really a reaction to the biases of the outraged surfacing. Recent studies indicate that bias is a human trait; a remnant of early survival mechanisms. I know I have biases and prejudices. I recognize their patterns when they arise. Consequently, and in most cases, I'm able to set them aside so that I can deal with people who are different from me in the ""here and now"", between ""me and the person in my presence"", and not respond from a past  incident in the ""there and then"", with persons who are not present. Prejudice will always be a problem as long as our prejudices and biases remain hidden. It is from their dark, mental dens that they hold sway over how we interact with people who are different from us in the present.
Question: Have any persons of color, particularly blacks, responded to this event? If so, what have they said?"
"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.
Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.”
Ungrateful is the new uppity.
Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.
Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
"Heck, all they need is a hurricane and you'll see all the looters come out...! And what is the color of their skin? Let's not get PC about the truth. Why doesn't Obama, Jackson, Sharpton, and other leaders of the black community say anything about these thugs who cause property damage and mayhem...? Only one reason... they are of the same color... That folks is racism... And they practice it openly and the left wing media will not touch it..."
"It's important to remember that Spanish treatment of American native laborers was so bad that one early 16th-century observer,   Bartolomeo De Las Casas, argued for the importation of African slaves as a REFORM! Read his treatise ""A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies"" to get an idea of why Columbus seems so repulsive to us now. The destruction of America, both its peoples and biome, BEGINS w/him.

Conversely, Las Casas later recanted his support for ALL forms of slavery and can be called the first modern human rights activist. In other words, it can be said that the modern concept of human rights advocacy--advocacy grounded in a critique of inequitable power relations--begins as a reaction AGAINST Columbus and his ""discovery"" of America.  

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Short_Account_of_the_Destruction_of_the_Indies"
The answer is no because he doesn't have a problem with Black America; he has a problem with people like the author who have an agenda to push and use race and identify politics to push it.
Everyone in plain black pajamas might do the trick.
"We have no obligation to foist our idea of what we consider to be the greatest good on someone else. Assuming we are dealing with adults, he or she will almost certainly resent your meddling, as well he or she should. It's related to what Warren and Brandeis, in their article, ""The Right to Privacy"" called ""the right to be let alone"". You have neither the right nor the duty to be a busybody.

So, let me repeat my question: What do you see are the duties of gays? Specifically, what duties do they have that I, as a heterosexual, do not share with them? If the answer is ""none"", then they have just as much right to marry as I have. I am speaking of civil marriage, of course."
"Gigi- this opinion piece calls our war-time action ""shameful"" and tries to make direct comparisons to this Presidential  Administration- how you do not view this as apologist is beyond anyone.
.
However; your recollections were enjoyable and only further underscore the need to remove fictitious totems of racial appropriations such a the Empty Chair Memorial, naming highways after MLK, when the man never even set foot in the state, making an official state observance for ONLY the contributions of blacks on the Alaska Highway, etc."
And they're still not over it. They want to do an old commie style history revision and completely undo Obama's legacy and make like it never happened. Apparently even the memory of a black president is something they can't deal with.
"Indulging in political masturbation and fancy irrelevant historical facts and manufacturing ghost enemies while ignoring the insult, disrespect and contempt with which the Guptas have treated the South African citizens. Just remember that by your silence you have betrayed us. You and your ilk have made some black South Africans to start talking about apartheid in nostalgic terms. Yes, it is true. Get on the trains, the taxis and the buses and you will hear ordinary South Africans lamenting alk the sacrifices they made to put you in government."
"They censored nigger? You make a quote that blacks are not persecuted for saying n-1- g-g-e-r and it is overwritten? I  had black a UO basketball players say to me, ""what up my nigger"", as he came off the court for half time. It just struck me as funny and definitely not racist or worthy of uproar."
"You didn't judge me? Hint: when you say to me: ""I bet people ""like you"" made excuses for slavery,.. ""mock"" Black Lives Matter or  Spare me your ""fake"" outrage... you ""are"" first stereotyping me, then based on your created/assume Stereotype, you are incorrectly Judging me as a person, on words or actions, I haven't said, done or believe.  
Your point, if someone kills with their car, with ""intent"" to kill, verses an accident with  no ""intent"", it is view & penalized differently.  I'm not saying she was right in doing it (I believe she didn't think through how her actions would be perceived by others, based on past history)  but her ""intent"" was not to purposely harm or ""Mock an entire race for kicks"", based on info provided. Thus I don't think she should be penalized as you described.
As your ""intent"" was not to Stereotype or Judge me, but you did, but I will accept your ""intent"" was to not, as you were just trying to make your point, that you feel strongly about. 
Good luck in life"
"A ""sick and depraved"" attack - as the British are calling this, is correct.

But why is it never ""sick and depraved"" when ""we"" do so much worse to innocent Muslim women and children - millions brutally killed over the last 30 years - in the Middle East and Africa?

There can never be a justification for this kind of violence it seems, except when ""we"" inflict it on others.

Why do we never hear of the ""heroes"" who pull out burning children from under US and NATO bombs? Why do we never hear of the weeping husband cradling the smashed bodies of his wife and children after a drone attack?

The problems of global terrorism and war, can only be solved by all of humanity working together. It appears that we still have a really long way to go."
Are you kidding me ?   Take just one city---Chicago---blacks there kill more blacks than all the blacks killed by police in the entire country .  How come Black Lives Matters don't care about those black lives ? How come Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson don't care enough about those black lives to march against all those killings ? How come Obama doesn't speak out against all those black on black killings ? How come NFL players don't care about those lives ?  For that matter---why don't you care about all those black lives ended at the hands of other blacks year after year after year after year ?   The NFL restricts everything the players wear and when police were killed in Dallas they wouldn't let NFL players where something to bring attention to that tragedy.  Yet if it's an anti-American protest as in not standing for the flag---they are all for it.   Only 10 percent of players disrespected their country yesterday but to hear the liberal press dishonestly tell it---nearly all did.
"Perhaps you weren't aware that the attack on a Thomas, a black conservative (and Catholic) was much bigger than a he said/she said with Anita Hill."
"I've been going through this with my step son for a year and a half now.
Born into a decent middle class family, he lived off the fat of the family and never bothered with a decent education or even a trade.
His criminal record (drugs) limits his future and getting around the selfish hedonism is an ongoing project.
But we're getting there. He has been working consistently now for a few years and his credit rating is back in the black but no guarantees unless he learns financia
People talk about the 'math scores' in Ontario, but fail to focus on financial literacy.
My parents we born into the working poor but (after surviving WW2) worked their way into the middle class - allowing me the chance to acquire a university education and so survive the industrial down sizing that started in the 1970's.
If he can get over himself, my stepson will survive and prosper.
If he's wilfully blind to financial literacy, then he has only himself to blame.
At least now he knows it."
"You do recognize the irony in your ""back of the bus"" comment? A real concept for people of colour, a quaint euphemism for those who never suffered this indignity."
"Not all of them but many of them are for agreeing with Trump about blacks, women, the disabled, etc., etc., etc.. Being American does not mean being conservative only."
"While I don't condone killing either by police or revenge shooters, all of the black youth and men that've been murdered by Caucasian police officers is finally having a backlash.  The boiler plate is off and now it's going to be very tough putting the genie back into its bottle.  The Rambo-style officer in this photo looks like he's ready to lock and load.  Someone this charged with racist heat shouldn't be allowed to wear law enforcement badge or gear.  There's no second amendment rights when it one's intent to go out and kill in the name of the second amendment.  Poppycock."
"When will Gloria Allred trot out his ""victim"" of sexual harassment or the woman who claims to have been his mistress for many years? Allred is very good at doing that sort of thing  to destroy the reputations and career of black consrvatives."
Unfortunately if we are going to allow free speech then it has to be for all and not just black lives matter or the liberals it has to include all nuts.
"NAACP should just say Black Americans, when you say African Americans that can be any race or color, because an African American is someone who was born in Africa and came back here to live, that is what an African American is, not only Blacks."
"I guess the dead woman had a pregnancy that conservatives didn't think needed saving at any cost. I'm sure they will not complain about the cops conducting an abortion by gun shot. Off course, black lives don't matter to the folks that support the police, right or wrong. Don't take my word for it. Read their posts here. they can always rationalize killing black folks, even in the womb. So much for the morality of pro life movement. Most of them support police shootings of unarmed black people. I guess some unborn lives are more or less equal than other lives, in their sense of morality."
"“This is more than a single day of action, this is the beginning of a movement – to protect, defend and advance human rights, even in the face of adversity""

Very nice mission statement . And what do you think the result of protesting in pu&*y hats while you're protecting, defending and advancing human right will achieve? You might be better off dressing up as Wonder Woman or Bat Girl."
"""...put hoods on and went with torches to ..."" rectories. 

Quite right, Mary O'Malley. The KKK targeted Catholics (spelled with a ""K""), African Americans and Jews. (I won't publish the repulsive ""K"" names for the latter two targeted  groups.) Shame on our Catholic leadership. Symbols of bigotry count! They are almost as timid as English Catholic bishops who fear protesting against the burning of an effigy of the pope on Guy Fawkes Day in England. The latter (as do all religious and political leaders there) simply look the other way, believing in time, people will come to their senses."

"If you want to take a good long look at the US's racist past including who the owners of those ropes hanging from sturdy trees were then go see Dinesh D'Souza's documentary film ""Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party""... Then you will have your answer. Blacks have gone straight backwards under Obama Clinton these last 8 years ...and I know black people are sick and tired of being lied to and promises broken by the corrupt democrat party"
"First, I am not “coddling” or “protecting anyone, hate is hate no matter who it is. You validate your hateful speech by digging up people who have just as much hate in them as you. It’s that greatest of all argument of “they started it”, but like that argument, you are all childish.

Second, “And African Americans don't like to be equated with rump rangers. Ask them” (your words) says everything anyone needs to know about you. You are not only homophobic, you are racist. Free speech is great and powerful and you use it to disparage anyone who’s not like you, does not agree with you, and maybe does not look like you. 
 
""Rump Rangers""? Ae you in middle school? You are nothing more than a troll that brigs nothing to a conversation outside of looking for a fight that you cannot win, don’t care to win, just so you can spew hate.

Stop, just stop."
"Allie, to be fair, left-wing hate groups were part of Hillary Clinton's base, and a huge part.  Surely you have heard about Black Lives Matter, the New Black Panther Party, Code Pink, the Islamic Society of North America, the Council of American-Islamic Relations and Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan (MEChA).""  You haven’t?  Then read this:    http://www.horowitzfreedomcenter.org/sites/default/files/leftwinghategroups.pdf 
These hate groups have grown in importance within the Democrat Party and Democrats eagerly got in bed with them to help Clinton win a dishonest and rigged primary election against Sanders."
"Yes, and if you're black and walk into a restaurant and they say ""we don't want to serve you, get out,"" you should just leave and find a place that will serve you. Simple, just like the south in the 1950s."
"What do black slaves have to do with this, and why do you capitalize ""Black slaves""?"
On any day stand at the corner of College and University Avenues in Toronto near four major hospitals and you will see the following sight. A man in ordinary clothes is followed a few steps behind by a woman dressed all in black wearing a niqab. She is pushing a baby carriage and looking after one or more other children. The man does not appear to be helping her in any way. The progressives in our society believe that this is great and that the woman dressed all in black with her face covered in a niqab while struggling with children without her husband's help is exercising he freedom.  What do you think?
"While I have never taken ""the Trump wall"" seriously and have great reservations, I am just finishing the book ""Dreamland"" by Sam Quinones on how Oxycontin opened the US to Mexican black tar heroin. Further he describes how easily the Mexican dealers spread throughout the US - easily. Far too easily.  Now that black tar shows up in every corner of even Alaska, I begin to wonder what the US can do to effectively slow and reduce this plague to our country?"
Thanks wise guy. You're proving my point. Blackface nothing new. The fact that she is claiming she didn't know what blackface was is mind blowing. It doesn't matter if I agree or disagree with her actions. It's her claiming ignorance that bothers me.
Washington built this country with the help of millions of black slaves.  The confederates tried to destroy that nation as did the Nazis. Why do you hate so many Americans?
"After reading the article, one is made starkly aware that this piece is precisely where it belongs-- in 'Opinion'.

An opinion is an imagined truth.

Perhaps this emotional exercise-- in this kind of identity politics (racism-lite)-- would also have us believe that the terrorist-in-waiting organization Black Lives Matter is a promoter of reconciliatory conversation, an agent of peace."
"When I hear they are locking arms, my thoughts are:

1. They are locking their arms in unity, in defiance to the nation.
2. They don't have my values, they don't care about what I care about.
3. They are not sorry for what they've done. They regret the outcome -- a loss of future income - but they feel they are right. They are night. If Black people are oppressed in this nation, it is because they have oppressed themselves.
4. Watching again? Not anytime soon."

"I don't think most people in the former Asian or African colonies give a hoot for the royalty.

It is an undemocratic and classist institution. If a mentally ill person ascends to the Throne, you have to bow to them and call them Your Majesty/Highness.

This institution, where birth determines your position, should have been chucked out with slavery."
"' And Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney-general, has been criticized by civil-liberties advocates for what they consider his regressive views on the rights of women, sexual minorities and African Americans. '

What specific things did he do that were ""regressive.""  Even his Justice Dept. officials in DC said at the time when Sessions was a prosector in Alabama is that he (Sessions) vigorously prosecuted hate crimes against black Americans when others in the South were reluctant to do so.

You also say discrimination (past and present)  keeps African Americans from owning homes.  I think discrimination exists, but this is an off the wall statement that would have us believe this is the total cause.  It is not.  Lack of education, skills, and good jobs leading to lower income does not allow them to get on the housing ladder.  This is not discrimination, it is economics, attributed to social policies designed to keep black support for the Democrats.

Fake News Ibbotson!"
"I'm not defending Schilling, mostly because I agree that he's a clown. It's about being consistent. Hill at the very least deserves to be suspended, but since she's a black woman, the hyper-Liberal ESPN brass is deathly afraid of being 'racists' by some blogger."
"I believe President Schill's point is that it is inexcusable for a supposedly educated person to not understand the implications of wearing blackface in modern America. Her intent may not have been harmful, but her qualifications to teach law might just be called into question if she is that culturally ignorant. Such actions do warrant an investigation into whether she is someone who had one, rather large, blindspot or whether she is simply unqualified.

He did say that she could not be fired out of hand and would have her due process rights protected. I for one think President Schill is handling this bucket of slop he has been given as well it could be done. He's the best university leader I have seen in many a decade and he has my full support, not that that means much."
"So if America was determined by the UN to be violating the human rights of blacks that would be no big deal to you? 
Carding still goes on.
George Washington owned slaves, something in fashion at the time. Macdonald committed genocide and began the institutionalization of people resulting in sexual abuse, medical experiments and god know what else. Leave it to Canada to end up with the founding father starving people to death and that's a fact. 
Sorry, I'll take George  W."
"It's worth pointing out that the survey in the Black Experience Project didn't get a random sample of Black Canadians, and it also didn't collect any numbers to compare the responses to. That is, the BEP's report doesn't tell us how Canadians of other ethnicities report their experience of microaggressions; nor does it tell us how Black Canadians' answers to the questions have changed over time.

So the Black Experience Project can collect some interesting qualitative data and highlight perceived problems. In particular, the interview responses can give us a glimpse of *how* racism is felt by Black people to work.

But the BEP can't give us a very clear picture of how widespread racism is, given both the lack of representativeness and the lack of any comparison between groups or over time."
The have-nots leftists and poor blacks are protesting a lot these days and expressing their non-civility with loud screaming down others  instead discussing the issues. They get too much welfare and have too much time at hand.
"Yo -- how goes the comedy routine -- any more gigs?  Yes, Haydon as a Woman in Black -- perfect fit."
"Last Sunday was Gold Star Mother's Day.

32 Broncos knelt during the National Anthem.

That was a disgusting middle finger to all those grieving mothers, and to anyone who loves their country.  Good luck NFL.  I hope you pay close attention to the damage you have brought on yourselves.

I will be fishing with my son during the game this Sunday."
Whether Lincoln wanted to deport blacks after the war is irrelevant. Tell us about other irrelevant things Lincoln wanted to do. Did he want to see the Great Wall of China before he died? How about ride in a hot air balloon? Eat a hot dog in Coney Island?
"There were no Black kids who went to Silver Lake Elementary during the years I went there. No Hispanics, Asian, Islanders,... Honestly, growing up in Snohomish County was like growing up inside a jar of mayonnaise. I am so happy to now find some diversity in our neighborhoods. Wish it was more, but I'll take what I can get."
"Where did I say that black slaves weren't people?
You'll say anything for your agenda.  It just shows your desperation."
"Being butthurt that Bernie lost the primary isn't the same as black men and women being racially targeted, abused, harassed and murdered."
"The ""no-disparagement"" clause was there from the beginning when Black Press bought the former Star-Bulletin in 2001. It was contained in an agreement that all Star-Bulletin employees had to sign in order to be ""rehired"" by Black's Star-Bulletin. I remember being upset about it at the time."
"""Nevertheless, the article does not square with the mission of universities to produce and transmit valid knowledge.""

In this post-truth period, in which falsities have become alternative facts in some circles, universities have a particular duty to protect their status as institutions that produce valid knowledge.

They have become institutions trusted to discriminate between knowledge worthy of attention and knowledge that warrants various doses of caution

From the U of T course list :  : WGS440H1 Postcolonial Cyborgs for Planetary Futures:  Speculative Fiction Feminisms
Drawing together film, fiction and theory, this course invites students to explore ways of imagining other worlds. From afro-futurism to planetary humanism, from cyborgs to hauntings, from science fiction fantasies to the politics of aliens, the course examines and produces feminist, postcolonial, anti-racist, and queer visions of other worlds.

ahhh, yah, professor...validation indeed"
"What, God? Gail Collins looks like someone I would love to have as a friend. By the way, she has had her teeth whitened since that portrait was taken. And, she doesn't look the slightest bit dog-like.  Ann Coulter has been accused of having a horse's face, but that's not a dog, either.

Am I to suppose that you look like Rock Hudson? James Dean? David Bowie? Liberace?  -all handsome men, in their day.

I once had a girlfriend with a big nose. She also had abundant glossy straight black hair, a slim figure, a thoughtful and reserved demeanor, and an IQ of 150. At a frathouse party, a pimple-faced wretch spoke up: ""You're dating Solveig? She's a dog!"" I couldn't help but laugh in the wretch's ugly face."
"And if the baseball cap said ""eff u defendant, you're black so you're guilty""?"
"Years ago I knew a Danish born farmer in Zimbabwe who had a prosperous mango farm. He was a decent guy who provided decent wages and free schooling for his black worker children. A mobile health clinic visited weekly.

When he publicly supported the political opposition Mugabe's thugs burnt his farm to the ground and left everyone destitute. The dictator has destroyed the economy and, consequently, trashed food exports and manufactures which provided income for a deteriorating health care system."
"In 2013 Marble said: 

“When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race. Sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up. Diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup, and you just can’t help it. Although I’ve got to say,” she continued at the time. 
“I’ve never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it. Everybody loves it.”

There are plenty of genetic markers that influence each and every racial and ethnic segment of the population of Earth... Why did the Senator single out African Americans?

And, WHY would he be tossed from his den for asking an honest question?

Could it be that the Scout LEADERS were attempting partisan influence, and got caught at it?"
"Personally, I feel that opportunity, implicit bias, inconsistent discipline, and a number of other things contribute to the problem.  I personally believe that all students are capable of being successful in school.  I also feel that family and community are also responsible for the success of students.  I myself am going into teaching as a career after 10 years in the public sector so I can contribute to helping students that look like me succeed.  I see previously that someone mentioned starting a school to support African American students, which is also my plan."
"I'm done with the Broncos too. They can't even issue this statement without talking out of both sides of their mouths. Why are these spoiled athletes allowed this disrespectful voice and President Trump is not? Why is his speech divisive and theirs is not? He was elected to lead. He is. These players are not leading. They're disgraceful. What are they united against? Police? Then have the guts to say it! If that is your message, have the courage to say it and allow Americans to decide. The NFL is horrific. You penalize players if they wear a symbol for 9/11 or murdered Dallas cops? But you can't say anything about this, even though your rules say you can? So young black men are being killed and nobody is going to jail? That's your protest? It is happening, every day, in Chicago,at the hands of other young black men. Your protest is in the Chicago Mayor's office. My Broncos jerseys is in the trash. I'm going to spend my time celebrating heroes like our Police, firefighters and military."
"""Mourned the killings of unarmed African-Americans""
-
Not one word about the blacks who targeted, ambushed, and killed cops simply because they were cops.....in some other jurisdiction.....even in some other state? Such ""selective thinking"" on Fitzgibbons part is wrong because it only help fuel groups like the KKK."
"Your reply makes no sense. I am not wrong at all, it is you who is incorrect on your facts. My opinions are not unsubstantiated, they are completely substantiated. If they are hurtful to you, it may be because there are facts here of which you choose to be unaware. Liberals tend to be more highly educated and use reason more than conservatives, who work from raw gut emotion. First, JFK didn't deputize the state's national guard, he federalized them, which he was legally authorized to do under existing USC. Here, Trump and Sessions completely lack authority to federalize or deputize local law enforcement agencies that do not consent to be federalized. 

So your example of Kennedy and the Alabama NG is completely unsubstantiated, wrong, ignorant and misinformed, to use your own words. Your zeal to push your unconstitutional position is driving you to post unsubstantiated and hurtful opinions.

Yes, racists are conservative. There is no dispute on this. That's how they vote. QED."
I miss the good ol' days when a competent black man was President.
"""On election night in 2008, like many Americans, I was overjoyed that our nation had overcome its historic racism sufficiently to elect our first black president.""

Barack Obama was elected because George W. Bush was the worst president in American history.  It is no surprise that deep seated racism slithered out of the sewer of American history to oppose him.  Now it has elected its own president."
"Yes, it's impossible to mention north Portland without invoking deep history. 

And it's easy to assume that every commentor on a ""black story"" is a racist jerk. I'll admit to being a jerk on my best days, but I've mostly worked through the former, and try to be a better parent in that respect than mine were. 

Charter schools are always a difficult situation. On one extreme you have corporations looking to turn a profit, and religions and idealogues looking to undermine public education. On the other extreme we have parents just looking for a better solution to their child's education. Long-term, those two agendas are often diametrically opposed to each other. Short-term, maybe not so much. My point is that turning over public facilities to charter schools is a slippery slope... in the long term."
"It depends on if we claim ALL US citizens are racist or not.   

You don't doubt that racism continues as  problem in this country do you?

The legal system is a part of U.S. institutions, including law enforcement and the courts.   We have hundreds if not thousands of historical examples of racism in both those institution, particularly in the south and many continue to this day.  The conservative SC just identified that race contributed to Gerrymandered proposals from a southern Republican state redistricting, that's Now.

If you mean the US ideology of a democratic society includes racism - then no.**   If you look at the actual behavior of some US institutions then you will find incidents of racism.

**It's clear that our founding document included inherent racism by not granting full citizenship to black persons.   While the law has changed, it's equally obvious that racism has not been eliminated.   

So far, we have no way to legislate what one thinks or feels."
"I doubt that anyone will dispute your concept of ""illegal alien"". Yes, there are people - identifiable because they're Mexicans and easy to spot (well, some might be from Guatemala or Ecuador or  anywhere south of the border. They all have dark skin and talk Mexican) The difference in perspective is what these people bring to us. I'd much rather exploit illegals than spend a day wading through entrails at a slaughter house or meat packing plant, or stooped over in the hot sun picking berries. I suppose you will be working in the agriculture field soon?"
"Wait till they find out she is a black transsexual , then watch them spin"
"They should all be given long sentences and thrown in prison like they did during the crack epidemic, but of course  that situation involved  a bunch o black and brown people, so now it's treatment, sympathy, and a public health emergency. You got to love America...that great ""Christian"" Nation. Unbelievable!"
"Neither do the protestors.  BLM was predicated on a lie, and we get but a handful of brutality cases against blacks a year, but they always result in burning neighborhoods.

If anyone REALLY wants an eye-opening experience, they should google the video ""Activist critical of police undergoes use of force scenarios"" and PAY ATTENTION TO THE ACTIVIST'S RESPONSE AT THE END."
"They do Dennis.  All lives matter.  Now.  Your letter is like this to me:

BLM: Jack fruit is given a bad name for such a nutritious .........  Your letter:  Why not talk about ALL fruit.  The discussion is on 'jack fruit' not ALL fruit.  

All lives matter but there are serious and very egregiousness behavior that seriously jeopardize  the safety of African Americans nationwide.  L2g"
"It doesn't really work to refer to the Declaration of Independence when you're talking to a black man. Charles Dalton's ancestors were excluded. They were property, with no unalienable rights. No right to liberty, no right to pursue happiness, not even a right to life.

You're saying the Constitution doesn't say anything about providing housing. True, but things change. We have a huge population now, with no more 40 acres and a mule available. Wealth is concentrated at the top, and poor people have no place to go. Taxing wealthy people is not a form of slavery. Only slavery is slavery."
"What a sad piece of propaganda.  All americans regardless of race or creed have the ability to recognize right from wrong and vote accordingly. Mr. Trump will do well with all Americans.   If you want to look at the blacks, most would agree that eight years of Obama has done nothing for them and there is every reason to believe that Hillary will do even less.  Trump will drain the swamp in Washington. The Clintons will both be facing criminal charges and will leave a blight on this republic's history forever."
"Thanks for noting that, Charles.  Racial injustice is baked into American culture, and Chicago is a compelling example of this. We illustrate for all the world of how un-necessary Jim Crow laws actually were. Segregation, intimidation,  separate and unequal access to education, housing, work, and prison. 

No party has earned the right to hold its head high. And sadly, few parishes have.  I appreciate Cupich's efforts on this, and hope his flock follows. The respect Fr. Pfleger has earned in the black community has long been countered by disparagement and worse from  outside the ghettos. Perhaps Cupich will be able to help more people understand that we are all neighbors here, brothers and sisters, enabling more of us to act according to that truth. The sad tendency has been that the worse things become, the more profoundly those suffering are abandoned."
"You don't know your church history at all if you think it didn't argue against heliocentrism in favour of  
geocentrism. Your arguing just emphasizes your ignorance of history.

The Catechism is filled with ignorant statements targeting women and the LGBT community.  Again, your denial highlights the depth of your ignorance in these matter. 

The church is growing percentage wise in Africa and the Asia-Pacific regions but declining dramatically in the West and Latin America."
"I'm skeptical of this psychology research into teaching evaluation ratings. It also doesn't help that this article doesn't elaborate on the general methodology of that research. I think that having a correlation between racial minority/female and lower teaching outcome offers limited insight. It would be more meaningful if the study had an auditor to evaluate the instructor against the students average ratings. In particular, instructors of color who have a thick accent or struggle to speak clearly shouldn't be included in the study for bias as their ratings would be lower because of their poor communication skills. In my own experience as an engineering student, I strongly question the role of bias in a student's perception simply because the material is so hard that most could care less what the instructor looks like. Professors who can effectively explain difficult concepts clearly, are highly respected and valued by students. Speaking of bias, couldn't research be biased?"
"Right, Federal court protected that right. Bet Black Lives Matter,  Black Gorillas( rebranded Black Panthers),  and Chaos were there. Confrontation was a planned test by all fronts to see what the government is going to do about it. Looks like both sides  came equipped, people with attitude, flags (to rally around), uniforms, and armour (shields, helmets, sticks, improvised flame thrower) along with a new police attitude, tolerance, which is interpreted as weakness by some. Actually more interesting than pre season NFL."
"The Trump years are a waste of four years. Trump is not great. What is notable with Trump is he is a incessant liar and not particularly competent. Mexico is not paying for his wall. And his failure to come up with a viable alternative to Obamacare was a reflection of his lack of knowledge and leadership on policy matters. Ryan and McConnell wrote the legislation behind closed doors rather than holding open Congressional hearings. Trump was wasting his time golfing and watching television since it was an embarrassment for him to talk publicly or privately about the subject given how stupid he is. Trump bought his college degree. He did not earn it. 

Trump is not inspirational and lacks legitimacy. Most of his opinions are driven from his racist point of view that blames immigrants, blacks, and Mexicans as the source of all troubles. So it is not surprising that he supports the Klan and its attempts to rename itself as the alt-right. And he failed to win the popular vote."
"For some of them? Forever. Because he makes ""libtards cry"". That's how low they have set the bar. I'm not kidding. It doesn't matter how much of an embarrassment he makes of himself and the country. It doesn't matter how often he brings us to the brink of actual nuclear war. It doesn't matter how much economic damage he does to his own base. It doesn't matter that he takes to Twitter and obsesses over things like people kneeling at football games when Puerto Rico is still mostly without power.


None of this matters, because much of his base are so nihilist that they don't even care if they are getting battered by his policies, as long as they think the ""blahs"", the women, the gays, non-xtians, the liberals, etc., are getting it worse and if they think tRump is erasing the black president's legacy.


A core of deplorables will stick with him because he pisses off what they perceive to be ""liberals"" - i.e., anyone who is not dumb/hateful enough to have voted for this moron."

"If you read this thread of comments you will see that the ""blame game"" is in full-force.  It accomplishes absolutely nothing POSITIVE and only intensifies the divisions already present regarding the issue of violence in America and, specifically, the violence between the police and the Black community.  

During the riots which followed the acquittal of the officers involved in his beating in 1992, Rodney King famously asked ""can't we all just get along?""  The answer, sadly, was ""NO, We Can't"".... It's 24 years later and, again sadly, the answer continues to be NO.  What the hell's wrong with us as a society?  Can't we, somehow, do better than this?  Forget the ""blaming"" for a moment and perhaps offer just a little suggestion or two regarding what we (you and I and all the others who ""meet"" on this site) can do to help stop this escalating violence.  BTW: That's my suggestion.....quit blaming and start think of ways to move things in a positive direction........ regards, Gary"
"Kag ,  I suspect there are as many causes of  a vote for Trump as there are those who voted for him .  
How to account for the woman who thanked him for making it possible for her husband to go down into the coal mines thus making it easy for him to suffer from Black Lung  Disease which , by the way is even more likely now than previously .  
People who benefit from welfare voted for him .  Where were they when  Trump promised to destroy such programs ?  
The backing of  Trump by Republican Catholic bishops astounds me ."
"Exactly.   The decision to act against Zille is prompted by party-political tit for tat.  The South African electorate generally is so narrow-minded, and their mindset is rooted in victimhood.  Their nearest present-day counterparts are Zionists - any criticism of Israel is translated as anti-Semitism."
"And that accounts for all those 'black folks' in blue States not showing up to vote, exactly how?

These are nationwide results.  Lots of  blacks voted for Obama both times and for no one this time.  

""In fact, Pew reported, the decline of 7 percentage points from the 2012 presidential election marked the largest drop on record for black voter turnout from one election to the next. ""

"So if you know it isn't racist why would you label me as such??? You immediately placed a label on me because it's easy and usually shuts people up. Your defending Islam by attacking me. Telling me what I say and think is incorrect. I value and welcome your thoughts. I may disagree with your point of view, and you with me. I'm not offended, but you are and make assumptions about me. I'm not perfect and can be wrong about a few things, but this isn't one of them. Your point on reading comprehension is a jab and label at the lack of education. In your eyes it may be justified.. five college degrees may say otherwise. Yes, I'm a conservative, and I guarantee you have no idea what that means. My fellow friends, who are of black, oriental, native and Hispanic descent agree with my political views... that's why they are my friends."
"Mr Saunders, like many on the left sometimes seem to have capacity for evasion of reality with a coefficient of infinite elasticity.  President Obama is a colossal failure economically, in foreign policy, and in domestic relations.  

Economically he has  more than doubled the US national debt to $20 trillion, put 46 million on welfare, 95 million out of the workforce, an annual trade imbalance approaching $1 trillion, a real unemployment rate of 10%+ not the fudged GAO 6%, Obamacare as a  failure, and an inversion problem with manufacturing and finance operations under foreign registry due to high taxes and over regulation.  

The Middle East is in chaos with ISIS in 28 countries,  600,000 slaughtered,  a million refugees  mostly young Muslim men destabilizing western Europe, the Russians and the Chinese emboldened. Our allies no longer trust us  and our enemies neither respect or fear us. 

Black Lives Matter endorsed  by Obama with 25 police officers assassinated speaks for itself."
"No Mr Summers, black people who hate Jews could not fit in with Nazis.

"Hi Allaha. I know you're just trying to be funny, but you know better. Racism is never funny. Think for a moment about how this might hurt the vast majority of innocent, law-abiding, caring, kind, bright, and beautiful Blacks, young and old, female and male. Think especially of Black children, the keiki, the most innocent. I know for a fact that you would be protective of them just as much as you would children of all the other races. This is especially true in Hawaii, where aloha for children is a given. Peace."
Has the WHO completely lost their minds? This is like electing Steve Bannon as the goodwill ambassador for Black Lives Matter.
"Hillary Clinton famously called Black youths ""Super Predators"" during a 1996 speech, which she apologized for after being called out during the campaign. Democrats are all in for Planned Parenthood, an organization that was revealed to be selling dead baby parts to the highest bidder. And finally, Hillary Clinton again once said of the Blacks ""Bring them to heel"". If these are part of ""family values"" that you share, then more power to you, Ma'am."
"What relevance does all that have to the embezzlement issue under discussion?—Ed McManus  When we studied justice and rights in school, my classmates and I decided that in this life there was to be neither justice nor rights.  The idea is to behold the face of God in justice . . . or the apparent lack thereof.  Should a pastor fleece his flock, he would not be the first.  Just as Black Catholics surviving those sold down the river by the Maryland Jesuits, rather than set them free, just as those surviving Black Catholics kept their Roman Catholic Faith, so must the rest of the Faithful occasionally, when also fleeced by their pastors.  Jacob should not have had to fight with his loving God.  That demoniac should not have been possessed by an evil spirit, to begin with.  All of such goofy stuff can draw the Faithful to contemplate God at Mass . . . at least maybe.  😊"
"MT907 wrote: ""The tired old “racism” charge is getting a played out and isn’t working anymore…the left really needs to work on its creativity.""

With Trump it's a reality though  MT907 - the company his father created and he now runs routinely refused to rent to people of color - so much so that DOJ got involved.  

and I quote:

""The Justice Department undertook its own investigation and, in 1973, sued Trump Management for discriminating against blacks. Both Fred Trump, the company’s chairman, and Donald Trump, its president, were named as defendants. It was front-page news, and for Donald, amounted to his debut in the public eye.""

"I'm not familiar with ""the kids who filmed the black guy drowning.""  You're saying some kids let a guy drown for political reasons?

But anyway, I'm sure we could name right-wing and left-wing killers all day.  We'd probably end up fairly even.  

But, the left really seems to shine when it comes to rioting and destroying property.  They far exceed any damage by the right.  And once again, this story is about vandalism and destruction, not murder."
"What about the 60,000 to 93,000 free blacks who fought in uniform for the Confederacy????  Though records are spotty...because of the vast destruction in the south during the war....Blacks started fighting in 1861.  The Union didn't allow blacks in uniform until late 1863!  The war itself was not fought over the issue of slavery,  but state's rights (slavery being ONE of the issues).  There never would have been a war IF the S. Carolinians hadn't fired on Ft. Sumpter, and if Lincoln didn't respond militarily to ""Preserve the Union""...which was the reason behind the war (not slavery).  The ""flag"" you are so upset about isn't the Confederate States flag, but the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was and is still an ""American Flag.""  (Also, there were 6 northern states, or under federal control where slavery was lawful, until AFTER 1865.) Emancipation Proc. only freed slaves in the seceded states!"
"your grandma is in a refugee camp outside aleppo, the sudan or yemen. no clothes, no food, no money, no documents. i think the community where the grandson, cousin or uncle lives should be allowed to vet and vouch for her. i also think diverdave and rangermc would let her rot, and die, in that camp, primarily because she is not a born again christian."
"Lets see, wasn't it coal miners that were so fond of the so called president? To ""help "" them he took away stream protection, maybe now they can get rid of all those silly safety regulations that really don't help, then Medicaid  so they can't get treatment for black lung. Yup back to a third world country, America is going to be so great again."
"Kimaren, your bias/prejudice is blatantly obvious !  But, then, its part of the mindset.  We blame Blacks for their mentality of playing the victim, demanding everything for free, venality etc. , but its like not seeing the beam in your own eye."

"Basically it is non interference by government.
We have put our economy in a straitjacket and we complain it is not working. So what do we do? We tighten the buckles.
Liberate the economy. Get rid of the BBBEE (especially on small businesses) and AA and watch the economy explode. Blacks will be absorbed into the system, in management and ownership etc, simply because they have to be. The market will decide it. Currently we need BBBEE and AA because we have hobbled the economy and positions are severely limited. 
What we have now is not working. Instead of amplifying what is not working lets try something new. Something that has worked elsewhere. Let us not be another Venezuela."
"Hillary's demographic strengths seem to be old men, old women and black voters.  Bernie's got the younger Democratic crowd.

"Especially since you have that ego to take back the neighborhood and you target people minding their own business. Hoodies are bad and black  or dark skinned folks in them are even worse. You took a picture of the vehicle and then you made a major mistake and on purpose made sure they knew what you are doing to them, then if they were indeed criminals with a good arsenal in the car they could have opened fired and shot you and any other person who happened to be in range.  Your rhetoric will fire up the hearts of those who are weary of crime but watch more true life crime shows for the unattended consequences of actions taken in frustration or anger by private citizens with good intentions such as yours. I don't want a person who lacks common sense around me or my kids playing a wannabe cop. A license plate and photo was more than sufficient for the police to ID the people. You are really looking for trouble."
"The fear is that if all who are called by God to be priests can be ordained, a priest will be respected and admired and promoted based on his or her talents and spiritual strengths in Christ instead of his grand sacrifice to give up marriage for the sake of pastoring a parish.

Now how great a pastor, preacher, leader, teacher, confessor, etc will be what a priest is valued for and those priests weak in these talents and spiritual skills will start to appear as the weak priests that they are and get pushed aside.  

Also women priests mean women bishops, cardinals and popes, real equality, so no one group of automatically lesser humans - to tell yourself - Well, at least I will always be more important than those people.  This could equally apply if we were to decide we don't need any black male priests or Hispanic priests.   If Trump were pope, people like Pope Francis would be told they can't be priests because Hispanic men are all unclean, violent criminals."
"All I want is for the police to stop killing unarmed black people including children. I consider that state sponsored murder with the police union contracts defending that behavior. The police have never thought protecting and serving black Americans as a priority. In fact, they have been known to work with the Klan to murder black folks over the years."
"""Interesting comment. Do you have any stats showing how may black men were shot by police as well as stats of how many black males were shot by other black males?"" 

That comparison is absolutely irrelevant.  However if you do wish to continue your line of reasoning. What would be the outcome if we found that black males killing each other was 100 x greater than that of police killings. The actions of the former are crimes and so those police killings are crimes as well.
The police have had too may cases where they used deadly force inappropriately. It needs to stop"
"In the meantime, Trump is at war with his own GOP, its leaders, with half of America, women, Latinos, African Americans, the middle class, the poor, and most of the world. He is out there mostly by himself because nobody wants him around."

You had the winning combination of crony capitalism trying to hold the African rent farmers harmless and the Roman/Ravennan power elite trying to keep the mob from ripping them to shreds by trying to provide for them with dwindling wealth.   Sounds a lot like the US today.   The Gibbons' meme is just Christian ""moral failing"" propaganda; the end of the Western Roman Empire was just real politic.

They are not going after Cretien nor Mulroney. Why? Because there is no political mileage to be made out of them. This story is fake news. The authors rushed to publish without checking the relevancy of the information.

It is good sport to watch parliamentarians rant but from what I can see this issue is dying a slow death. It will be forgotten like the Panama Papers.

Unless, of course, if someone finds another trove of documents to publish."
"A terrorist group may not be protected...but an individual citizen who may sympathize with a terrorist group could be. He doesn't have to be a member of the KKK. Just a guy who likes the KKK and takes delight in screwing with this black business owners because he resents the fact that he is a business owner and not a janitor or a share cropper. I am making it complicated because I see the law as protecting ONE group of people and saying ""screw you"" to all other minority groups. In this example the Baker in the case has stopped making wedding cakes. It would be a shame if a Jewish or Black or Latino or Asian baker had to make the same type of decision when they harbor no ill will towards anyone other than those who harbor ill will towards them.

"A ticket maybe ----but sure as heck not charged with murder.  When has any adult been charged with murder because their passenger wasn't wearing a seat belt ?  I wasn't in the courtroom and I assume you weren't either .  The judge was and heard all the evidence . It clearly shows this guy wasn't given a rough ride----and in fact it appears he stood up and bounced himself around inside the back of the van.  This , in my opinion , was a simple case of a black prosecutor showboating for blacks across America--by talking tough when she had to know she had no facts to back up her charges.  The only victims in this case are the poor police who have had their reputations and lives changed forever because of the bogus charges .  I hope they all personally sue the prosecutor ."
"There you go again, justifying name-calling about one president's skin color while undoubtedly feigning outrage if anyone did the same against the dark-skin one.

Ah...so what 'race' are we talking about here?  We Muslims are probably the most 'racially diverse' group on the planet.  Can't imagine my Syrian/French/African-American/Welsh/English/Fijian grandchildren promoting their 'race' over that of my Syrian/French/Iraqi/Welsh/English nieces and nephews or that of my Costa Rican/Panamanian/Jamaican/English in-laws.  That would be too complicated for even me to figure out...

"So games like grand theft auto, call of duty and the others in the genre or tv shows like the plethora or CSI's or dexter or sons of anarchy, or movies like sawI, II, III, hostel, gamer, and many others with a death count in the hundreds didn't have ANYTHING to do with the lawlessness and disregard for public safety or authority over the last 25 years????!!! It was those darn black people and rap music you say??!!. Yeah ok 😂"
Shills; paid to say anything...and DT gets 25% of the black vote? Where did that come from? A DT press release?
"highandry - I am unsure how one disagrees with black letter law.

In fact Uber Canada has this to say at its website:

""Driving with Uber is a great way to earn extra cash, whether you're paying off bills or saving for a vacation. When tax season rolls around, you need to keep these extra earnings in mind though.

As an Uber partner, you’re an independent contractor; meaning you are self-employed. This matters when filing your taxes.
...
We also provide an annual Tax Summary on your Uber profile to help you and your tax advisor understand your earnings.""

Uber has partnered up with TurboTax which notes:

""Money earned from Uber driving is considered self-employment income and taxed as such. You may deduct eligible expenses from the fees you collect but calculating those expenses can requires detailed record-keeping. Not only must you keep track of the kilometers you drive for business, you must also record the rest of the kilometers you drive the vehicle throughout the year."""
"Possibly, but let's hope it isn't.  Who knows what horrors await next?  But somehow I feel that you like him provoking the media, blacks, the poor, and illegal immigrants.  Should we now add uppity, overpaid athletes to the list?"
""" The retired pediatric neurosurgeon ... is known for his personal high moral standards...""

Which are? 

I do know Trump recently attacked Republicans who weren't ""standing by"" their ""man"" when Trumps hateful sexual predatory comments came to light. 

Even a black South African immigrant to this country knows claims of criminal sexual acts when he hears them. Maybe we need to review our laws."
"The fact that he and BHO have personal/professional ties, and also that they may have met prior to Watson rendering his terribly prejudiced decision should make him ""faulty"" and his decision should be nullified.  This is similar to what former POTUS Clinton did talking to AG prior to HRDs email scandal.  Watson is a damn fool if he had discussed this matter with his buddy BHO (black panther, extremist muslim operative).  So sorry folks the show should end here.  CONSPIRACY written all over his decision!!!"
"Okay, I just googled both ""burkini"" and ""modest swimwear.""  There's an awful lot of overlap there.  The burkinis aren't all black, and some of them are very cute. Some of the modest swimwear is also very cute.  I learned about it from a plus-size friend, but I'm sure it's available in all sizes.  I'm too pale to ever go into the water unprotected, so I wear a dive skin.  It's black.  Would the French arrest me too?"
"I just got a brain fart. I know our country is not perfect but I do know that after 8 years of Obama it should be better for the blacks that it is. So by protesting that blacks aren't given a fair shake, isn't it Obama's fault over 8 years and not Trumps who hasn't even been in office 9 months. Didn't Obama blame the first 4 years on Bush! Beside I think we as fans should take a knee every time one of these protesters drops a ball or fumbles! Why, they let us down! They should be perfect like they think our government should be. Only thing is, I as a fan am not making $10 million and giving nothing to my cause!"
"If he were black, they would have just shot and killed him."
"I'm sure Steve's right about gerrrymandering by Democrats, (but not on this scale?)    Historically, if they cheat it's to involve more voters, not less.   Lower poll standards, driving people to polls, using unions to strong arm members to stay in rank with Democrats.   But they also provided voting rights denied to blacks for over a century and they did it in a territory that caused them great loss in voting.   The segregationist south, long held by Dixiecrats has moved steadily to Republicans.     At least the Democrats, even with their corrupted political proffesionals sought inclusion, not exclusions.

I'm a independent, but that doesn't mean that I don't look for differences in the two parties.  I will have no viable independent candidate, due in part to the machinations of both Democrats and Republicans to exclude any candidate outside of their tidy twosome, in a closed private primary system.   I'll cast a vote, but it doesn't look like I'll do it with enthusiasm."
"And  back in the day, everyone didn't do well in the old public neighborhood schools.  Lots of kids were left behind.  Of course, special needs children didn't have the right to a public education.  That wasn't until the 1970s.  And the segregated schools where black students were taught up until Brown vs. Board of Education were appalling."
"By the way...just for your own education - the two police officers who were murdered last week?  You know, the two you still haven't remarked upon?  

Officers Matthew Baxter and Sam Howard?  

Black.

Now how are you going your spin your false accusations against me?"
"So hey, Leah, why don't you write about your indignation of the new left-wing fascist violence upon anything right-wing or Trump? You must have some indignation here.

Hollywood elites like Madonna wanting to blow up Washington? Sarah Silverman calling for a military overthrow of the government? Or how about the Black Bloc violence in Washington on Inauguration Day or the recent anti-free-speech riot that recently occurred against conservative UK journalist Milo Yiannopoulos, on UC's Berkley Campus, the very home of 60s free-speech?

None of his is protest anymore. It smacks of left wing calls and provocations to greater violence - especially for the masses of those easily-swayed weak-minded lefties . So how do you explain or rationalize that to your little children? Or do you even bother? Too adult for them, right?

That all makes 'cuck' sound like a funny word in a child's nursery rhyme."
"“Football and politics, it doesn’t mix."" Ya think? So why did the NFL pay Beyonce to put on a tribute to the Black Panthers at Super Bowl 50 halftime? Tim Tebow took a knee to pray, and the NFL attacked him for doing it. Now the NFL thinks it's swell to take a knee during the national anthem. Christians are fair game but millionaire athletes are protected? Rights for some, not for all? Who makes these decisions at the NFL? Since NFL players have no 1st Amendment Rights to protest on private stadium property, this means the protests are condoned by the owners. Yes, players have a right to take a knee. Your employer has a right to praise you or fire you. Your boss can fire you if you piss off customers at work, and so can the NFL. You want to support your teammates? Start by supporting your country."
Crime by blacks has gotten way out of hand. Your beliefs aren't backed by statistical evidence.
"Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Occupy Wall Street and The Nation of Islam to name just as few. And yes, fascism is a far-left ideology."
"That's what I'm still trying to figure out.  What, PRECISELY, is their beef?  What are they trying to accomplish with kneeling during the National Anthem?  Is it just some vague, general perceived ""black inequality"" thing or what the heck is it?  (I have a hard time feeling sympathetic about ""equality"" when a guy like Von Miller is making about 1000X more a year than I do.)"
"For the one thousandth time: The most important trait an NFL QB must have to be successful is the ability to read a defense pre-snap. Cutler can do it, Kaepernick can't/won't/doesn't do it.  He's a one-read-and-run QB. RG3 has the same issue and wouldn't you know it, he's also unemployed. The ""but the NFL allows wife beaters, drug addicts, and other criminals, but not a socially conscious black man"" excuse doesn't work here. When players commit the crimes listed above, they only embarass themselves, their teams, and their fans. Kaepernick took a very strong social stance and executed it in a way that alienated millions of paying fans all around the country. That takes it from a team issue to a league/owner issue. Just as Kaep had/has a right to take his stand, the owners have the same rights to not employ him and in the process remind the other players that playing in the NFL is a privledge."
"Remedial President? So, let me see. If you believe this, you must be for the following. High taxes, N.A.F.T.A., carbon taxes, low growth, high debts and deficits, allowing the Chinese government to purchase major American companies, pro transgender men in womens bathrooms, pro illegal immigration, pro war with Russia,and pro preventing Africa advancing economically. Remedial President. O.K."
"As Ronald Raygun said, facts are stupid things.

There's not any evidence that three million non-citizens voted in the election.  There is evidence that the Republican Party conspired to kick off actual citizens from voting rolls if they were perceived likely to be ""voting while black.""

It's an old, tired, nasty tactic for crooks to deny everything and make counter accusation.  Make America Hate Again seems to be the plan."
"I'm so sorry charles dalton, I see you disagreed with my last post. I was being sarcastic, which doesn't always work in print. I didn't mean to make light of Tamir or cops killing unarmed black males. Sometimes sarcasm isn't appropriate. I apologize."
"Charles, take that chip off your shoulder and do some research....start will Walter Williams, a very sharp black professor at Geo. Mason U.  Check ""blacks who fought for the confederacy"" (Yes, there were black slaves who fought, but there were also FREE southern blacks).  Slavery was an ""economic"" issue,  as there were free blacks who THEMSELVES owned slaves.  I'm just stating facts.  I'm not the one denying reality, or history.  Blacks fighting for the south did so for their homes, their families and their state.  Maryland, Delaware, Missouri,Kentucky, West VA, and NJ were all slave states and remained in the Union.  Northern slave sales were actually taxed by the IRS beginning (I believe) in 1862 to support the war effort.  It wasn't until 1863 AFTER the Emancipation Proc. that the Union army began accepting blacks.  The ONLY black who fought at Gettysburg was a confederate from Louisiana..who lost an arm at Cemetery Hill.  I KNOW what I'm talking about.  Do your own research!"
You left out all the blacks killing other blacks.  I don't see them protesting the over 3000 blacks shot by other blacks in Chicago this year.

"Just like in civil jurisprudence, the new overcomes the old. We don't have apostates stand in fromt of the Chruch anymore in sack cloth and ashes. Indeed, except in Syria where Islamic State attacks Christians, we no longer have apostates. There is no one else on earth who is being told to abandon Christ or be martyred. Maybe Pashtunistan, but I suspect most of the victims of Muslim Trads are simply killed rather than being given the opportunity to express faith in Allah, since Allah is Arabic for Elohim, which is Hebrew for God. Technically, saying there is no God but Allah is not apostacy because it is the same word. DH, by the way, gets us out of that mindset which has wars over religion or doctrine. That  is not piety, it is sacralidge. DH is the final step in denouncing the past sacrliedges of the Inquisition, the 100 years war, the Crusades and the blood shed in the 4th Century over heresy."
"Mueller is not going to resign.   so,let him do his job.

"But she is the original corruption queen of South Africa with Sarafina.   Not to mention the recent claims as well as being the SOLE reason she's being pushed is so that the likes of Zuma (JG) and Duarte never see the inside of a court room, let alone a jail cell.   There's not a SINGLE other reason to push this blatantly useless cadre deployee than to keep the trough eating corrupt fed.

There are much better candidates, who not are only women but also black.  Except they are not as corrupt as NDZ, and they dont have the corrupt likes of Duarte and the other ANC swill behind them to push them.   It's disgusting that the most useless AU chair ever thinks she can run a country and promise populist rubbish to do so with the stench of non-stop corruption around her."
"You are paranoid, Media focuses on his blackness (race) articles from National Post focus on Jewish donors not happy with Obama regarding UN resolution on Israel.
Jewish donors very angry in the Chicago area. Therefore complain about media giving attention to his racial make up and also take it up with NP and Chicago donors complaining.
Thought Police at work!"
"The issue of which names should be kept, which statues should be destroyed is complex. I have tried to find someone who is above reproach and acceptable to everybody and have failed to find one. Mother Teresa - unacceptable to atheists; Mohandas Gandhi - considered black Africans to be inferior; Queen Victoria - symbol of colonialism and empire; Pierre Trudeau - unacceptable to Conservatives; Tommy Douglas - unacceptable to conservatives; Albert Einstein - unacceptable to Palestinians."
"""How's that working out?"" 

30 murders so far this year; another 135 shot and wounded; victims were 73% young black men. Only 2 of those were offficer-involved shootings.  
Apparently, the people doing the shooting didn't get the BLM message."
BLM should be kicked out of Pride and march alone in Chicago in a hail of black on black gun battles. The cops were good sports to take part and Pride allowed black racists to hijack them-cowards !!
"As tragic and difficult as this issue is, ostensibly impossible to resolve as the fronts concerned with justice for victims and those concerned with justice for the falsely accused seem unable to even acknowledge the concerns of the other side, I find it intellectually dishonest and simplistic to paint a picture of the old days as a big free for all for rapists. It was anything but; sexual assault has always been disproportionately punished. Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan are the least countries in which you would like to find yourself accused. 

But justice was even more than now tied to your social class. A low status man had no chance against the accusation of a higher status woman - see the black lynchings - and the other way around. And one of the easiest ways for women to lose status was to be ""loose"". Inequality, not misogyny, explains most of the blatant miscarriages of justice in the past."
"You're so cute and funny.

The gay couple isn't likely to burn a cross on your lawn and string you up.  In fact they just want a cake. 

I would guess a lot of racist folks have had their houses painted by black and mexican guys.

So yeah, you hire a house painting crew, they aren't go to runaway when they see your bumper stickers, unless they feel in danger. 

While you are at it, make sure the guy working the drive through is the same race as you are. 

Does this cake guy think he's going to be hurt by making a cake for a gay couple? Is he going to loose his soul?  We better check out scripture on that one."
"The reason why feelings alone CANNOT  be the basis for official action is simple. I am not responsible for your paranoia. 
Note that I am not suggesting that black fellow students of the poster in California are paranoid; they have objectively reasonable grounds to believe they are being threatened. However there are people, most notably American policemen,  who will feel threatened without reasonable grounds; their feelings are not and cannot be my responsibility, so a right not to feel threatened is meaningless.
This is not merely hypothetical, it's personal. I am quite pacifist by nature but I am very large; 195 cm., 150 kg. There are people who feel threatened by my simple presence in their vicinity. Do you believe that I violate those people's rights simply by being out in public.?"
"Why did so many black people boycott the 2016 election?  

Because neither candidate was Barack Obama.  

Bill Clinton's old claim to being 'The First Black President"" didn't transfer to Hillary and neither did her promise at the end to be an Obama clone."
"Are you by any chance a Bill OReilly fan? Are you saying that BLM has authority over all blacks?  Wow. That's some power they have. Maybe have one cop that has murdered someone actually found guilty, would be a start. You're calling for lynching, not me or BLM. Just hold police responsible when they break the law. Train them not to profile minorities. Stop making it a crime to being black while driving, or shopping or trying to get into your own house."
"I can't think of another insurance I am forced to buy unless I entered into some kind of an agreement entity. I am not forced to buy homeowners insurance unless I have purchased a house. I am not forced to buy auto insurance unless I purchase auto. See the difference

""Or do you really not care about the social good of all citizens?""

I hear this nonsense a lot. My answer is now and always will be making someone depended on the central government for their financial well being is not always for the social good, it fact in many ways it is actually a determent to the social good. The welfare state has done to the black family, that which racism couldn't do, and what the Jim Crow laws couldn't do. It has virtually destroyed the foundation of the black families."
"Couple of comments:  First off the symptoms described are exactly those that I myself feel when I ingest a large amount of alcohol quickly.  Disorientation, black out, memory loss.  It may be that the bartender's sin is putting lots of booze in the drinks rather than diluting them with mixers.  Some patrons and some bartenders think giving lots of straight booze is a favor.  Second, normally, a person needs a motive.  It appears that the bartender did not approach or take advantage of the women affected.  It is hard to imagine a motive.  Third, it would be very important if the women involved knew each other or had prior heard allegations of misbehavior by the bartender.  Very strange.  As usual, many commenters here project their evil selves on to the bartender and believe that just being accused is proof of misbehavior."
"There were ""hardly any"" blacks in Oregon because Oregon was socially and, importantly, legally hostile to them. The legal hostilities weren't expunged until late in the last century.
Look up ""A Peculiar Paradise"" online, a good history of Oregon racial laws and relations."
"I guess it depends on what you mean by help.  In Washington D. C. vouchers helped black students get into Sidwell Friends, the school that President Obama's kids went to, until Democrats took that away.  Are you saying vouchers didn't help black students?  Amazing!"
"Wally,perhaps not,as most black people seem to have a bad case of O.J fatigue after supporting his acquittal for the murders."
"Trump said ""wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners..."" That is not demanding they all get fired. 

The NFL is 70% black, and they are some of the highest-paid professionals on the entire planet. Maybe they go to another country, one of those much fairer places, to play? Oh wait nobody else cares about football. 

I'm saying maybe come up with some actual demands / things you're protesting specifically. Rosa Parks was protesting the fact that public transport was segregated. These players are not oppressed in the slightest. I would be happy to stand behind them if they had something specific they wanted to change, instead of hijacking the national anthem to protest some general feeling of inequality."

"Nah, black lives do NOT matter any more. They do NOT respect law and order. They do not respect other people's civil rights or even their own race's. So snotty and stuck up.

"Alceste, to your question,  I have to add: And if not now, when? The wounds of police actions towards gays have largely healed, and police participation in Pride was a welcome salve. 
I get a sense that BLM will grind away on their axe until all that's left is filings. 

And yes, the 'last minute agenda addition' comes off sounding like skullduggery."
"Why don't you right wing goobers pull your heads out of your a$$ and realize that your just pissed because these folks in sports have talent and you have none. You all for the most part will never make any money to speak of and will bitch about you deserved more until you die. Why because you all think of yourselves of victims and always will. Losers who will blame everyone else for your lazy a$$ problems.

"Blacks and Jews are similar. As soon as there's any perceived injustice, the race and anti-semite cards go flying."
"Slaves  are sentient people , fetuses are not. Are you ready to forced donations of bone marrow, blood products  etc; in order to save a human life? That's  the same demand  when you force Women  to go tthrough an unplanned and unwanted  pregnancy. To be sure,  adoption does not solve the problem  because  the poster child (literally, in billboards  from Pro Life across  America) representing the ideal child to have available for adoption  are healthy  ARYAN infants. Seen this for  myself  in  Black and or Latino neighborhoods!"
"A direct quote from Colin Kaepernick, who started all this: ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.""  Any player who mimics his protest is subscribing to his rationale.  My question to each member of the Broncos organization: do you have pride in this country, or do you consider it oppressive?  If the former, then stand up and respect the flag, and if you refused to do so previously, apologize for having endorsed Kaepernick's message, whether intentionally or unwittingly.  If the latter, then come right out and say it, and quit being hypocrites, claiming to support those who defend this country.  The fans deserve to know where you stand, so they can decide if they want to contribute to your egregious salaries."
And people wonder why black athletes are kneeling during the national anthem?
No one hired the Black Panthers and Obama had nothing to do with them.
"BLM and the afascists are idolized by social media founders, given full reign."
"Levin is writing from a libertarian/individualist perspective and is blind to the existence of other world views.  Many economists also share this blindnerss.  He sees the egalitarian movements of the sixties and seventies-as well as the hierarchist/authoritarian movements on the right (such as the Moral Majority and the pro-life movement) as actions of individuals.  They are much more than that.  The civil rights movement still lives in the SCLC and Black Lives Matter.  Occupy is a quntessential egalitarian movement as is the gay rights movement.  He is blind to the nature of collective action, however, so he misses a lot."
"But I don't get this ....how is this black lady going to assist in attaining accountability for this mess, we need ""ORIGINALS""."
"Obama used Romney's Republican Health care plan. But since Obama was black, the Republicans refused to work with him to reform health care. They have a lot of voters who hate Obama due to his skin colour."
Usually no race is given In this case.  How do you know he was African-American? African-American isn't a racial group.  Blacks can come from a lot of different places.

"Let's limit the conversation to American history.  Do you believe that racism has had an equal negative effect ""on all sides"" throughout the history of this nation?  Since the end of the civil war?  Since Brown vs. Board of Education?

Would you concede that the oppression of people of African descent by people of European descent in this country far exceeds anything that flows the other direction?  If not, can you offer any historical examples of discrimination against people of European descent that rivals the systemic oppression of people of African descent?"
"Your ""black on black violence"" theme outs you, sir, the favorite red herring of the far right. I'd bet money you don't give a rat's a@@ about those lives. And since you asked, yes, sensible gun control advocates do care about urban violence, rural violence, all violence, no matter who commits it against whom. That's the entire point. For the record, I am a gun owner and civil liberties watch dog who believes that it's entirely possible to protect the 2nd amendment right to bear arms and still curtail the mass trade of assault style weapons. Watch out, complexity alert."
"Using your logic, lt would appear that when B.Obama was at ND, there was even more reason for a walkout. Look at B. O's record on human life, such as infanticide & abortion. What would Jesus say to that?

So which ""policies and actions which directly contradict Catholic social teachings and values and target vulnerable members of the University's community"" is V.P. Pence endorsing? 

Does opening the borders to anyone, who would probably take jobs from unemployed black youth help? 

Sounds like the ""walkouts"" haven't learned much at ND, especially not wanting to hear a different opinion. Or, ""My mind is made up, don't confuse me with facts""."
Nope. Gone too far. Brandon Marshall is throwing Black Power signs during the anthem. This is far from over.
I could make comments on a beautiful red sunset or an evening being pitch black and someone will find something racist.
"How blind are those who will not see. The ANC seek a worthy woman to succeed Zuma as president. From her comments I would say that there are few, if any, women within the ANC who can hold a candle to this firebrand. Yet now, because she pleads with her colleagues to stand with her and the people of SA against a corrupt, rapacious tyrant, his greedy cronies and handlers, she is hounded, derided, threatened and kicked out of her job, when the party should be putting her forward as a prime candidate for Zuma's job! How much more filth must the ANC smear itself with before they realize how much they stink?"
"What is with racism and the NFL. The NFL has been a pon by the race baiters for years. At a time it was the percentage of black player's but no black head coaches, then black head coaches were hired, and it didn't fix anything. The country elected a black president, twice, and it didn't fix anything. And now we come to today. What is the complaint? The players are upset, because Trump dis them? WOW. That's it. The players and the left say they're are not disrespecting the flag, then why do it during the National Anthem? To bring attention? Attention to what? Attention to the condition in the black communities, how is taking a knee going change anything? Rather then taking a knee, shouldn't these players, tell those in the black communities how THEY made it. Haven't NFL players experienced guilt by association, by the police, has all of us has at a time in are lives, by the type of car they drive.  The players are being use as pon as much as the NFL."
"The only thing Sessions's ever did was prosecute, prosecute, and prosecute hate crimes against blacks, particularly against the KKK.  If you read his cases, you would know."

maybe he mistakenly thought it was a black man
"Mark and Nigel are terrified of having a black man occupy seat four. They try to come off like liberal progressives who care about diversity, but the reality is racial diversity in the political process in Portland Oregon is what terrifies them most. WW is the inbred second cousin of the National Inquirer and its struggles to stay afloat, having to downsize the actual newspaper, for financial reasons is part of the slow, painful demise of this irrelevant newspaper that no one really cares about anymore."
I don't see any mention of Black Lives Matter.  Or are they too busy plotting to disrupt Pride celebrations again in Toronto this Summer to worry about trivial matters like this?
"So, I guess the future of hockey is for its athletes to become the physically gifted but arrogant, spoiled children that dominate basketball, football and baseball.

So far removed from everyday life and people, athletes in those sports, mostly black, move in  a world where normal rules and decorum do not exist. Scowling ""gangsta"" athletes, with their entourages, vapor trails of abandoned kids and wives, and quickly diminishing bank accounts in their post playing days.

Yes, that may well be the future of hockey. No more ""aw shucks"" humility, fake or not.

I'll pass."
"Trudeau comes across as ""effeminate""? Who do you think you're kidding - Talk about projected envy! This is the guy who took on the Conservative Black Belt street fighter, and whupped him in about a minute, without breaking a sweat. I still remember all the braying and ""he's going to be beaten to a pulp"" from all the angry right wing commenters here. They were salivating at the pain they were expecting to see Trudeau suffer.

And of course the ladies love Trudeau. Why? Because he's disciplined, fit, cares about kids and is not fearful and afraid. Nearly all these attempts to ""feminize"" Trudeau come from angry men, who mostly seem to dislike independent and smart women who can think for themselves.

Sorry to burst your bubble here ""therock"" but you're telling us more about yourself than you realise when you make comments like this. I've never voted Liberal in my life, in case you're wondering, but I can spot a grown up, confident guy when I see one.

And it was not Stephen Harper."
"Really, utilitas?  You show a Trump supporter's level of understanding or race in America.   That explains plenty.   It is so funny that you should be sticking up for immigrants since your history of posts here points to them as the cause of America's ills.

I work with both of these communities.  They came to this country under entirely different circumstances.  The African-American experience was that of over two centuries of slavery that destroyed the family and then a century of non-voting laboring poor.  The recent Asian groups you refer to weren't slaves or barred from voting when the became citizens.  There were also no laws baring them from attending school or learning to read."
"The article states ""Eugene police said they had no “attempt to locate” notices issued for a black Lexus that night.""  The officer was lying to her.  
Black people stand out in Eugene because there are so few of them.  Police take notice. I'm not surprised that she has been profiled in the past.  It happened too my boss at UPS because he drives a fancy car.  It used to be hard to believe that this stuff happens until I started seeing all the cell phone videos of police beating or shooting unarmed black people."
"Masked black clad rioters attack unmasked peaceful demonstrators....which are the "" Nazis"" ?"
"Yes, the South was Democratic.   The United States, which had been secured by the Union Army had as President, Abraham Lincoln, a Republican.  There was no way that Southern racists were going to be Republican after the Civil War, hence the KKK, Jim Crow, etc.  This lasted, the Dixiecrats, until the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by then Democratic President, Lyndon Johnson.   Newly enabled, Blacks then registered heavily as Democratic.  You think the racist South was going to sit for that?  No way.  The South swung heavily into the conservative Republican party after 1964, away from those 'librul' Democrats.  Richard Nixon took advantage of that and won his Presidency appealing to those new Republicans of the South.  This is not the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, folks.  Lincoln would have been called a 'librul' Republican in his day."
"IT was also Harry's ancestors who ended British participation in the transatlantic slave trade . ""Are we not men and brother too"" was the rally cry. Starting in 1779 Britain worked to end slavery and by 1832,  50 years, it was all over, but no thanks for that.  The Arabian slave trade  was in full operation across Africa a 1000 years prior to Europeans,  and continues today  Virtually every Islamic country continues some form of slavery.  But blame Harry's lineage that it happened at all, before and after they were involved.

As soon as Britain ended its participation in slavery  they got richer than ever with the Industrial Revolution. Not a single black man was ever again in British  slave chains, yet you are not pleased by that."
"If criminal behavior in the Black communities of Canada and The US were in proportion to it's portion of the population, 3% and 8% respectively, the number of police shootings would follow suit. But you won't change your behavior so you blame racism for the differences between your relations with police and the rest of society. Even though this is abhorrent to you it would be worth a  try."
"This is exactly right Blue!  It took a lot of republican votes to pass the civil right legislation under President Johnson.  After that, the ""Dixiecrats,"" switched to the republican party.  Lincoln is turning in his grave knowing that is happening to his party.  

Also, those statues/momentos were erected in protest to the civil rights act and during the Jim Crow era.  This is an insult to people of color, put those icons in a museum."
So?  The Black Panthers and the communists gave their full support to Obama.  Neither Trump nor Obama should be tarred with what others say about them.
"Obama isn't a racist and a bigot. Trump is. Trump and his father were caught by the State of New York for not allowing black people to rent any of their properties.

That's why. Clear enough for you or would you like me to elaborate?"
"I find this rather ironic, especially since there are members of the gay community who find  rappers, predominantly black, to be quite angry, homophobic and disrespectful to the gay community... not to mention the Caribbean and African nations (again, predominantly black) that openly promote violence and even killing of gay men.

I'm still waiting for BLM to issue a response on  this topic (which they curiously seem to gloss over).  The irony of the situation is disgusting!"
"Bishop Braxton might be right that there is insufficient 'inclusion' of Catholic. On the other hand, it might just be to the advantage of, at least, the clergy. It doesn't take much googeling to find that Catholics were a bit late to - and a bit mixed about - the process. A tardiness not totally obscure to Dr. King as well. 
A little story: In the summer of 1964 several Jesuit ""Scholastics"" in clerics and a woman religious, in habit were among the packed-congregation at the Riverside Church on Columbia U. campus for his rendition of the ""Knock at Midnight"" sermon. After the service they joined the long line of well-wishers who met with Dr. King, his wife and children. Scanning the five person line of solid black, he greeted each of them warmly as he shook their hands.  While specific words are long forgotten, his genuine pleasure at their presence was tinged with a gentle tease."
"Protesting the national anthem, because you think all cops are racist pigs who kill blacks based on color, is like refusing to drink Gatorade, because you think coffee growers are killing bean pickers in the fields. One has absolutely nothing to do with the other. If you want to protest police policy, why not go to the station with signs? 

This all started when the racist, BLM cop hater Kaepernick wore socks with cartoon pigs wearing police uniforms. BLM is a parade of lies. Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown were both killed during violent assaults. Hands up don't shoot was a huge lie.

If BLM and their uninformed followers really cared about black lives, they would be marching through the big city ghettos trying to stop blacks from slaughtering other blacks. See Chicago. A black person in America is more likely to be killed by other black person than any other group, BY FAR. And cops are more likely to be killed by blacks than the other way around. The truth can hurt sometimes."
Gleason should have become a cop. His chances of acquittal would be much higher when shooting black men.
"Wow, our justice system should really stop murdering poor black people."
How did you become so obsessed with President Obama?  You write about him every single day.  Did you know that he's no longer the President?  Loathsome racist.
"I'm glad the altrightpubs went after the voter rolls and shortened times to register and vote. Send out fake junk mail in snail mailboxes telling everyone to vote the Tuesday after the actual day to vote. Other moves that clearly were focussed on the poor and minority. Especially black folks who were poor. We can't have those people voting EEK!
There's ample basis to make laws guaranteeing Americans voting rights and the voting processes. Simply put offending states on lifetime voter supervision by a nonpartisan committee and the funds for infrastructure and polling inspectors for enforcement. Crank up the penalty for such voter suppression tactics and election fixing.
History will remember how the Confederate states won in court to end restrictions designed to protect voters. Then moved quickly to crank the clock back to Jim Crow. Racism was over, according to the altrightpubs. The left said states will go back to Jim Crow. The left was correct. The left will repair the laws. Winning!"
"IRT ""NFL rant just one more distraction""  It is fascinating to me that a protest which originally was about police brutality and black lives matter is morphing into a protest against POTUS and his divisive leadership [or lack there of]."
"What  I wrote was: "" It sometimes seems that every time one mentions some crime done to Black people, the response offered is that they deserve it, in a sense, that they incurred the harm as a result of their own deficiencies.""  I could have been more explicit, and said ""...it sometimes seems to me..."" but I'd thought it clear that I was speaking for myself.

I don't think it ridiculous to believe that families would be strong if parents were proper parents. Neither is it ridiculous to think schools would have an easier time doing their job if they didn't have to contend with behavioral issues among their children.  What I was trying to get at was a stance I often encounter,  that upon considering these truisms, Black people are properly understood to be responsible for the wretchedness of so many of their schools, for the uncongenial aspects of their neighborhoods, the vexations they experience around employment, the disparities in policing,

The news that Canada has twice been ordered by its own Tribunal to stop discriminatory funding is real and not faux outrage. It is now court record and another black mark on national history.
"Your grasp of the situation is poor.  The NFL rich guys have many many places and situations to protest the injustice they think have been done to them..  March in Chicago, all of the rich guys....comment on the thousands of black on black killing...do something."
"It's worth noting that anglers have several other options available for descending devices that have been available for a while. Sheldon's Fish Descender  is very similar to what was described here. Ace Calloway , and Seaqualizer are also good options-- the latter automatically releases fish at preset depths

The ability of rockfish to recover after re-compression is supported by a growing body of scientific literature.  One of the most important factors determining whether a fish will survive is how quickly they are released back into the water, and not how they look externally. See:

""Recovery potential of black rockfish, Sebastes melanops,  recompressed following barotrauma"" A.L. Pribyl  et al. (2012)

""The effects of barotrauma on the catch-and release survival of southern California nearshore and shelf rockfish (Scorpaenidae, Sebastes spp.)"" Jarvis and Lowe (2008)

"Yes, if her training included ""shoot an unarmed black man with his hands up,"" she followed it to the letter."
I'm not sure I see a pattern of racial discrimination in favor of black people in this country.  Do you have any studies that don't include cherry-picked items?
"Now see I don't think we have taken steps backward.  It is the left that continues to divide us by race, religion, sex and wealth.  Every platform they have is how one group is being oppressed by the other group. Seldom do they talk of unity and the progress we have made as a county.  My gosh we just had a 2 term black president.  We have women, latinos and blacks on the supreme courty.  We had a woman as speaker of the house and one just win the nomination and a major political party.  This is a far cry from the 1960's.  Maybe if the left celebrated our progress instead of looking for the next political issue to divide us we would not have so much hate and anger in our society.  

Yes I use black instead of African American because not all blacks are from Africa.  Some are from Haiti, Jamaca, Australian Outback...etc"
"I was in Chicago this past summer and quickly realized how much the US economy depends on ""illegal"" immigrants. From gardeners, construction labourers and maids to kitchen help there are a whole bunch of jobs Americans simply won't do. When people say America will suffer if all those Hispanics are deported they're absolutely right."
"The next thing you know, people will expect restaurants to serve black people even if the owner's religion dictates against race mixing!

No, the baker losing would be a victory for freedom."
"Hadd makes his case that he surveyed women he met in person, online and even friends and family, discovering that none of those he asked could answer the question ""Why were women marching?"" Did he ask a marcher?
Then Hadd tells us why the women marched: ""they somehow think because they didn’t get their female president, that all rights afforded to women will magically disappear."" By using the term ""female president"" in that sentence Hadd plays his card: He thinks the march was about just wanting a woman president.
As a segue, Hadd let's loose his other issues, connecting his first assumption about why women marched (wanted a woman president) by saying it's ""sort of""  how minorities believed their lives would be vastly improved under an African-American president.""
So now Hadd has spoken for women, identified their issue and decided what minorities think too. 
Hadd ends with a flurry, calling them hypocrites and then filthy. 
Does Hadd represent the thought processes of the opposition?"
"Sounds like a winner. 100% of black vote, and the religious fundamentalists will forgive and forget."
"It can get pretty hurtful having pastors like that, When my wife and I were planning our wedding, we considered that our families speak different languages, so we kindly asked our priest if we could have some portions of the mass in Latin, then everybody would be on equal footing since no one side would understand more than the other.

He freaked out, and dropped all contact with us, the only time we got an answer from him was when we wanted to transfer to another priest to help us get married. Really sad when a priest can't see beyond his ego, for him anything that even smelt of pre 1960 was anathema. 

He could have just said no, right then and there or kindly referred us to someone else, instead of coming with an outburst and then blacklisting us. 

It goes both ways of course, and I am sure there are traditionalist priests that only do things their way instead of meeting the laity on their level and guiding them higher."
"Using Ferrell's ""logic,"" anyone who voted for Obama must be black. Anyone who will vote for Clinton must be female and a criminal."
"No, you do not have the right to express your opinion on this epaper. You have the privilege of doing so. This is a business and your comments have to meet the standards of the ownership of this business.
Harassing any citizen for crimes they have committed and having served their time, is prejudice, reflective of ill behaviour appealing to the base intellect.   It makes you look bad, not Black."
"Oh please! Explain Donald Trump then. He's a racist, misogynist, bigoted jerk who speaks for other racist, misogynist, bigoted jerks. And he's leading in the Republican party. It's horrible how black people don't want to die for not using their blinker or a busted taillight. The nerve of some people!"
Another young African American killed in the prime of his life by a racist cop.
"OMG...You are so far off! Racism is Not the reason Trump was Elected. Would you say Racism elected Obama? Of course not-it was the open generous heart of the American people saying: ""Hmmm... well let's give him a chance""... Having a Black President may help bring us all together"". It was based on his (professed) policies and statements of ""inclusion"" and ""Openness and Transparency."" None of what we got."
"That's sad if you really feel the police are the bad guys . Without them murder and crime would be off the charts.  You should know it goes way beyond just police investigating police. In Furguson Obama had dozens of justice department people flown in to try and hang the policeman there. The facts proved that death justified as well , yet the good policeman's life is ruined forever  Look how the authorities in Baltimore tried to hang their policemen and woman. There too justice prevailed .  Things started going bad for police when Obama told the nation police acted stupidly in the D.C. case before even knowing the facts---giving police across America a black eye and encouraging people of color to distrust and disrespect police.  As with every profession there are a few bad apples . However , the number of good police is perhaps 99.9 percent or greater . If you sleep well at night, thank a policeman who is out there covering your back. Police are hero's and the good guys in America."
"A tremendous amount of anti-gay and anti-black bigotry on these comments directed towards a protest move on Prides part.  Just vengeful and petty retribution really.

Canada is still full of hatred, from either LEO posters and other assorted bigots.

Just shameful."
"To trivialize the dreadful scourge and tragedy of crime in South Africa by using it for one's political ends is filthy and despicable. This march might have been about farmers, but it is also serving to focus attention on all crimes! It has often been said, that in a Western-style democracy such shocking crime statistics would result in the firing of the government. Let it happen here, that the people of South Africa force the resignation of this government which has served its own interests at every turn, and demand the appointment of a president and cabinet who are not only dedicated to the service of their populace, but who are honest and competent in their jobs! We have tolerated these less-than-mediocre leaders for far too long, enabled their corruption to our own detriment, and as a result innocent men, women and children have died. We have a police force riddled with criminals, led by a clown, and our NPA is a joke! Stop the race debate and stand in unity against all crime!"
"You really don't know that in the Early Christian Church---people elected their pastors, bishops even the pope.  Let me cite some references for you.

St. Cypran, a third century African bishop and martyr, recognized the election of Cornelius as Bishop of Rome because he had been ""made bishop by the judgment of God and of His Christ, by the testimony of almost all of the clergy, by the vote of the people who were then present, by the college of venerable bishops and good men....""

"I agree that fitting in is key. It is not just about merit. That being said…true story…picture a Senor HR executive with a major Bay Street Bank telling a group of black employees that the reasons why there are no black employees in the management pipeline is that there are no black MBAs at the bank. Also, picture the faces and absolute disappointment and horror of the black MBAs that were around the table with her. The point is, there is not always an opportunity to move beyond merit to then fit in. How would the black MBAs in this firm get a chance to prove to executives that they fit in if HR (HR!) did not know they exist. Career Advancement  101? It would be great if the opportunity was always there to exercise Career Advancement principles. There are so many other examples that I could cite, however at the end of the day, I am guiding my children to be entrepreneur as I do not want them to have the same unfortunate experiences that so many of us have had in Corp Canada."
"You mean facts?  

That show that the black lives do not matter to the blacks that are killing them?  Those statistics?  

Well, they do matter to the killers because the black victims are interfering with the killers' businesses of drugs, protection and prostitution.  They also kill the Hispanics who try and muscle in on their territory.  

It's mostly just business.    

Reality sucks!"
"""It has been more of a recognition that if you're going to remove those subsidies … how are you going to address these individuals who will be without? What is that plan?"" Murkowski said.

Indeed, Senator, what's the plan? It's been 7 years since the passage of the ACA and not a single conservative has come up with an actual plan. Murkowski doesn't want the government mandating what an insurance plan must cover, she much prefers allowing private insurance companies to do that...because that worked so well before.

 ""What's the plan?"" Geez...here are some things more likely to happen before conservatives come up with a plan:

Mississippi will become the academic achievement leader of the nation 
Beings from another planet will visit us
The second coming
Jeff Sessions will join the BLM movement
Mat-Su residents will get tired of electing crackpot legislators

What's the Plan? Ferchrissakes Senator, if you don't have a plan by now then sit down and shut up until you do."
If they get rid of specialty schools does that include the dedicated to black (sorry cannot recall what term I am suppose to use) studies?
"You clearly missed the entire point.  Kneeling during a mere song is offensive? But, killing black people a simple traffic stops is justifiable?  You are as sick as tRump the buffoon."
Look at who is calling the kettle black!  It is you BoC that has held rates at such low levels for so long that has created the debt binge in the first place!   Have rates at a level that makes people think twice on taking on so much and no issue!
"Their ""cause"" is actually a just one.  Now, is every cop shooting of a black person unjustified?   No.  Probably closer to the opposite.   But, even if they are few and far between and it's race related, it is wrong.  

Soros was in on this?  Hmm.  Never heard that one.

You're gonna have to bring me up to speed how their actions are going to start costing me a pay cut.  I don't see it, so I'm asking.  Also, how America is going to be ""lost"".  Not getting that one."
"There are over 300 Million guns in the US and several trillion rounds of ammunition, few in the hands of leftists; if we on the right were planning something, you on the left would know about it very quickly.   We have maintained our discipline against the leftist astroturfed violence and the Soros/SEIU funded occupy and BLM movements; you're not dodging bullets - yet.   The apparatchiks of the Left manipulate the moochers and looters by appealing to their emotions and promising them free stuff,  and have them raise hell, loot, and burn in Democrat controlled areas because they know the cops are neutered.   There is no likelihood of Red on Blue violence as long as the left stays in their Blue cesspools; bring it to the suburbs and rural areas, and there will be blood."
"Not at all.  It is the black youth I spoke of....not black athletes.  Black youth need better black role models....educators, engineers, doctors, lawyers etc.....not just jocks who came out of the hood and make it rain cash."
"So when the church owned black slaved not 200 years ago in the U.S. we should have been radically Christian in your opinion and just told those black slaves to shut up and realize they are just playing the victim.  

Great job.

I think you do not know what Christian means and actually need to read the Gospels which provoke all believers to stand up against hypocritical teachings of religious leaders.  Do what is right and treat all the same because there is no authentic unity without authentic justice for all.  

That is why Jesus tells us that above all else Love God and then love your neighbor no matter who he or she is and never treat others differently than you wish to be treated yourself."
"If the ""RAIL"" is used, as one example of government financial hemorrhaging, then there will be no end to government spending.

Raising taxes, a hiring freeze, Government department downsizing, increasing taxes, the government selling off some of its assets, etc... will only effect ""we the people"".

Only government infrastructure issues, should be the governments' concern, over the next few administrations.

You can't keep on spending money, that goes into a financial black hole."
"Another way to look at it would be to ask a question:
They are agreeing with Kap?
Kap is a radical believer in the koran?
Kap suports BLM and its violence against policemen.
Kap's beliefe in the koran means he is advocating the down throw of the constitution of the United States to be replaced by S. law?
Are these young adults alining themselves with a belief that identifies them for the rest of their life as possible radicalized believers of the koran?
The koran states in writing that it is at war with the United States.
Are these young adults now combatants willing to take up arms committing violence in our streets and back yard of our communities for beliefs espoused by national recognized symbols of our society?
Here is the hard question: As an elderly person walking the streets and paths of Alaska see these ""possible"" commiters of violence to my person and how to protect my self or should I be violent in return?"
Angry black woman couldn't keep her political gravy train going in the blackest state in the USA...example of more to come.
And people wonder why so many young black males are behind bars.
"How much longer will people still write, and the RG  still publish, the claim that this was   ""a private Halloween party?""  Mr. Urhausen himself would have been welcome had he come with a student or friend.
 Clearly it was very open, a virtual extension  of her class-- Prof. Schurtz officially and enthusiastically invited all her students and their friends, in fact some  students felt it was  an obligation  to attend and behave politely, thus their failure to register their concerns at the party itself.

I agree with Mr. Crum, that we've had too much "" self-righteous piousness"" which has caused even more divisiveness -- yes, it's time for all these one-sided,  nasty attacks on the UO  or Schurtz to cease as we look for ways to move on and achieve reconciliation.  
I'd like see Prof. Shurtz back in the classroom Jan. 9; an apology from the UO for making a bad scene worse; and a representative panel discussion with the NAACP on what it's really like being black in Eugene today."
"You can't be serious . We were getting walked on around the world , there were riots in our streets , the nation hadn't been this divided  in years.  Record numbers of people were on food stamps .  Illegals were pouring into our country  .  Obamacare was failing big time.  Even 98 percent of blacks voting for Obama wouldn't have elected him to a third term.  Had conservatives not stayed home he wouldn't have won a second term.  He left the democratic party in ruins .  Now he's burning American bridges---but that's even backfiring .  By not reacting , Putin has stuck it to Obama yet again .  History will record him as one of our very worst presidents , if not the worst . He worked for eight years to divide us by color and how much money we made.  His actions promoted people disrespecting police across America.  He's setting criminals free in record  numbers . Three weeks can't come fast enough ."
"It's funny how the lawyer appears to believe that an offender should have special consideration for being a ""brown woman"".  There are many faces of racism and sexism around these days."
"Thank you for your thoughts.  I believe, if we are to understand Christ, we have to look at the entirety of his life with his actions speaking louder than his words.  I can also say he said take up your cross and come follow me as well as my grace is sufficient.  Christ's life was no cake walk and I don't think we can expect following him to be without difficulty.  Love and self-sacrifice go hand in hand."
"I am wondering how the young women were chosen for this. Some for Clinton, some for Trump, a couple of undecideds. 

How representative is this group?  It's obviously too small to indicate anything at all.  But since the exercise was undertaken, choosing a sampling of young women from diverse racial, ethnic, and educational backgrounds might be at least slightly enlightening. 

Do they all have similar educational backgrounds? 

  An obvious problem is that there is not a single African-American, nor Asian, nor other minority, unless Ms. Ramos is Latina.   Nor was there a Muslim woman as far as I can tell."
"Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them. This law subverts our ability to be watchful.

Conflating the civil disobedience of a group who has to date never hurt or killed anyone with radical Muslim extremists is nonsense, and most certainly not the same thing. Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.

While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods."
"I have noticed many well marked crude pipelines near large shopping malls & schools in western Canada.

The real danger lies in pipelines carrying more volatile commodities than crude. Years ago I clipped a tube carrying natural gas into my house. I was using a Black & Decker lawn edger-trimmer. Back then they had metal blades not a nylon string.

The tube connected the small feeder utility pipeline to the gas regulator installed for my residence. The pipe in the ground was connected by a thin metal tube to the solid pipe by the gas meter. I thought that my house would blow up or catch fire. Fortunately there was no spark to cause ignition.  A new TUBE was installed by the gas company."
"(Part two of three)  As Isaiah 26:4-6 puts it, “Trust in the LORD forever!” as distinct from church hierarchs “For the LORD is an eternal Rock.  He humbles those in high places, and the lofty city he brings down; He tumbles it to the ground, level it with the dust.  It is trampled underfoot by the needy” particularly those who are denied Obama Care by the RCC insisting on denying artificial means of birth control to those unconvinced by their natural law arguments  “by the footsteps of the poor” who will get butchered by abortion attempts when denied hospital care.  In all of this business with natural law, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” and that is not necessarily the local cleric   “it is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man."
"That is problem with your position, there is no way a person could prove they aren't a racist, because you can find racism in everything a person says or does. I continue to hear black parents talking about having ""the talk"" with their children. Here is what the talk should sound like.

"Kermit Gosnell, a black man, is the most prolific serial killer in American history."
"The will of the people will be thwarted by various government agencies using any methods or means available. This is intentional. It is what will keep the black market alive and prospering. It will keep the courts and  jail cells full while benefiting the pot lawyers. Excellent way to reduce State government and remove any financial benefit the State would otherwise see. You can not protect everyone one from everything no matter how many laws and regulations you pass. In 10 years, we will look back and ask how things could be so screwed up."
"That was AFTER the march had ended anf it was a schizophrenic who rammed into cars ahead of him..a lone wolf.
What of BlackBLOC/Antifa throwing urine filled bottles at cops or using flame throwers as they did in Charlottesville?"
Was Black too mean? Are you kidding?!? The wuss-ification of America continues.
"Steve35, you are obviously a racist.  Vast majority of black people don't commit crimes.  You truly have no understanding of history and why blacks are disenfranchised in this country.  Keep living in your bubble.  You will always be wrong"
"I would hope that the ""historic choice of the first female president"" would result in the election of a woman who hasn't been the subject of so many unconscionable controversies.

Instead of discussing why the electorate failed, this publication could state why Hillary failed. Hillary failed as a First Lady, she failed as a U.S. Senator, and she failed as a Secretary of State. She failed as a candidate.

In eight years as a senator she only sponsored eight bills, three of which passed. That is a paltry number for any legislator. As Secretary of State she had little to show in her favor, and a lot to show in her failure. Benghazi was a huge black eye. Very few Secretary of States have had an ambassador killed on their watch--especially when forces were available to save said diplomat. As First Lady she protected a sexual predator--her husband--while trying to destroy the women he defiled. 

Wikileaks provided the proof that many needed to look elsewhere.

Trump was flawed as well."

"Its true that there are pockets of intolerance all across Canada but so far only Quebec has allowed itself to be railroaded down the wrong path. I note that the Bill is actually a bill to ensure religious neutrality in public but the only item being discussed are moslem face coverings... what about turbans, daggers, crosses , jewish headcoverings, black hats and robes etc.... none of them indicate religious neutrality so why are we only discussing niquabs?"

"The racism, corruption and elitism of the Democrats has finally caused the party to implode. From the Democrats embrace of slavery to their establishment of the KKK to their Party founder, Andrew Jackson and the Indian Trail of Tears they has collapsed. From the interment of the Japanese by Democrat FDR to the Democratic Progressive movement of Margaret Singer's eugenics to the establishment of mental institutions around the country they have collapsed.  From the racism of Democrat Woodrow Wilson who segregated the military and disbanded all Blacks from government service to Democrat Lyndon Johnson who kicked the Black man out of the house to give out welfare to the Black woman they have collapsed. From the Democrats who gave us the projects for Blacks, the ghetto for the Jewish American and the barrio for the Hispanics to the destruction of the all of the major cities in America to their party led by the Grand Klegal, Democrat Robert Byrd they have collapsed..

Good riddance..."
"Let me assist you. It was by Karl Rahner, given in his address at an American University on the occasion of his 72nd (I think) birthday. His speech was entitled ""A courageous, new, worldwide theology."" It is set out in full at the end of Richard P McBrien's book, 'Catholicism.'
He also states in the speech that he looks forward to this new theology which will not simply turn the pages of our ""familiar friend, Denzinger"" but will break new ground, listening to the wisdom from the East, hearing also the cries for freedom in Latin America and listening to the sound of African drums beating.
A wonderful piece of work. Such a theology also, he claims, will not demean those who have ""gone before us - whose grateful children we are...""
Unfortunately, we got Ratzinger instead. Personally, I wasn't very grateful about that."
"Funny how Karma is. Benghazi happened because the GOP House rejected State's request for more security money. They knew it was their own fault, so they deflected to State, Clinton specifically, because again, Republicans are incapable of taking responsibility for anything, unless it's credit for something someone else did. 

The Trump Admin's ridiculously baffling inclusion of our best ally in the region, Chad, in the latest travel ban, resulted in Chad withdrawing all of it's troops from Niger. Days later we've got 4 dead American soldiers. 

The Trump admin refuses to talk about it, and now they're deflecting by lying about a sitting Congresswoman, and by extension, a Gold Star widow, who chose to put the call on speakerphone because her late husband's mother was in the car, along with the Congresswoman who's an old family friend. 

I've become so grateful for sane, non-lying Republicans, even though they're sadly becoming extinct."
"Cannot help thinking that the fallout from the pedophilia scandal that we as Roman Catholics are still trying to get over pales by comparison to the one for which we would only have ourselves to blame if we, as Church, did not promote St. Maurice to the nation.  The number of suicides by victims of predatory priests is, thank God, infinitesimally small when measured against the more than five thousand young black males annually claimed by ""urban"" violence.

Because of Protestant denominations' unfamiliarity and discomfort with our own hagiographical traditions and sensibilities, I've long believed that the reintroduction and popularizing of this black saint to be a uniquely Roman Catholic obligation and one that grows ever more desperate and increasingly urgent.

"If Leonard would temper his writing with some compassion for other cultures that suffer the same injustices and worse, in some cases, he might gain in credibility. This land was taken by force from native nations, who were then put on reservations under treaty agreements that never materialized. A large portion of the Southern part of our land, was taken from a people by force, also. Those people were then sent South to Mexico. Their Ancestors are buried in the United States, yet they are considered illegal immigrants if they come back with out using proper channels. How proper were the immigration channels used by the Europeans that came here in the first place? Blacks were not and are not, the only race that has been discriminated against. If Leonard's goal is to end prejudice and discrimination to all races, I'd be in his corner but it doesn't sound to me like he's concerned about anyone else. Every article he writes, basically says the same thing! Enough already!"
"I've wondered about this and would like to know how many protesters, before and now, didn't vote... no one knows.   It was said a lot of millennials and blacks didn't vote, or voted with third party ""protest"" votes (which Bernie Sanders warned against).   Some will get a lesson about the importance of voting - some need to be reminded what the GOP did to the country last time.   BUT (I just looked it up) the total of presidential votes cast in 2012 and 2016 were 129,075,630 and 136,628,459 respectively... so 7.5M more people participated in 2016.  I suspect this is because most ALL who supported Trump voted, so he's lucky so many didn't vote.  You're right that those who don't vote shouldn't complain, but we'll see what happens during midterms in 2018."

"""On a summer afternoon in 1994, David Guttenfelder took a taxi from the Rwandan capital Kigali to the nearby region of Bugesera. He walked inside the Ntarama Church and began taking photographs of people who had been murdered by their neighbors. They had come to the small, red-brick church from all over the area seeking refuge—just as their parents and grandparents had come in the past when violence broke out between the ethnic majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. But this time the church, like many others in Rwanda during the genocide, became a killing ground.

Thousands of bodies—old men and women, young men and women, boys and girls, toddlers and infants—filled the entire sanctuary. “People piled on top of one another, four or five deep, on top of the pews, between the pews, everywhere,” he said.
 
In this archival photograph taken in 1994, survivors of a massacre in Nyakizu, Rwanda, stand outside the Cyahinda parish church where villagers said 4,000 to 5,000 people were killed."""

The poor, elderly, black, Latino etc may not be traveling by air or driving a car or going to bars. Right?  (I mean, think before you write and consider other people's circumstances different from your own). It is not unusual for the elderly - like my father - to not have a valid birth certificate. Many people do not drive.  Many forms of ID have been invalidated.  In otherwise the voter ID issue is a solution without a problem. This had been discussed and researched and these voters are clearly being targeted since they tend to vote Democratic.  There were cases in the past 2 elections, in black neighborhoods, when people showed up to vote WITH an ID that they were told was invalid. Please read the WaPo article and do your own research and keep your mind open to what you may not want to believe but is the truth."
"The census data for 2014 reveals that 3.9% of Alaska's population is ""black alone.""  It also reveals that 7.1% reported ""two or more races.""  Of the dual race respondents 4.3% reported as black. But now we have the slippery slope of how much of a particular race must one be to report a dual race profile?  But more importantly the article lacks information about the racial profiles of candidates for judge vacancies.  Isn’t that important in deciding if there really is a problem or simply a lack of qualified minority candidates?"

"Wavy look at this:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klanv  
 The first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. It sought to overthrow the Republican state governments in the South during the Reconstruction Era, especially by using violence against African American leaders. With numerous chapters across the South, it was suppressed around 1871
So the Democratic party was the start of the KKK.  Looks like Strom Thurmond did the right thing for the his children as well so I don't see that as something wrong. As far as switching parties that did not happen until after 1964.

"Paul,

being Indian, speaking two Indian languages (with some understanding of a third Indian language) helps me understand the Dalit issue far more than you. Unless you are going to claim that you are Indian too?

When there are 300 million Dalits, there are multiple facts that one can use to make any case. Are the Dalits better off than they were twenty years ago? Yes. Is there discrimination against them? Yes. The Sachar committee report has showed that the Dalits have overtaken the Muslims. Now if you are an Arabic speaker, you would know that the Muslims were the ruling class in India before the British came. So there has been a lot of churning in Indian society. 

And yet, there has been relatively less violence despite this churn. India has one of the least amount of ISIS members, despite having 180 million Muslims. Because the Dalit authored constitution has enforced democracy. In 1947, all Dalits could vote. All Blacks in the US couldn't. All Natives in Canada couldn't."

I don't see these same ""complainers"" & bench-side bystanders going into war zone neighborhoods to mentor in order to stop black on black murders.  How about doing a ""root cause analysis"" before blaming those that must take action (police/military) to combat the symptom's negative impact on the innocent general population.   Furthermore, any industry represented by Unions (entertainment, sports, etc). you can count on anti-American ideology, where they constantly complain about capitalism, racism & oppression, yet...have no problem taking millions, and oppressing others rights while hiding behind straw man arguments."
"I have to agree with brother Orobator:  We will never recognize the full ministry of women until we first ""re-image God"" devoid of all the patriarchal mythos that has such a death grip upon the Catholic hierarchy and priesthood.  God must be envisioned as being MORE than male, more than imaged as solely a father-god figure.

Actually, I believe that a new image of God was revealed to the world on December 24, 1968 [Merry Christmas!] when astronaut William Anders captured the iconic image of ""Earthrise"" from orbit over the lunar horizon: ""The Blue Marble"" serenely floated resplendent in the star-studded black abyss of space.

All of humanity is captured [save the photographer] within the frame of this photo of Earth as seen from its Moon,.  It was in a sense our first group family photo of all humanity.  

What an inspired image of the fullness of God, Our Mother!  It should be honored in every Christian place of worship along side of the crucifix and Risen Christ."

Imposing religious dogma on the population of this nation violates law and the Constitutional human rights of individuals over the man-made, false institutions yearning for gathering all under their black-souled webs.  The ranting of the religious ideologues in this forum demonstrates their willingness to saddle all others with their own inhuman views washed into their brains by the wealthy prelates of perfidity.   The same sources now ruling as dictators over the healthcare systems owned, operated, and profitted by the original christian lies.  Required reading:  Man Made God by Barbara G.

"In fact, he is being asked to cater the wedding and to write something on the cake that he finds offensive (presuming he finds those prohibited actions offensive).

Hobby Lobby is not being asked to provide personal services for a (insert religious objection like ""gay wedding"" here). The baker will sell cake all day long to anyone who asks. The decorations are his personal services specific to the wedding (akin to wedding photographers services).

This is not sportsMANlike.  Transgender should compete with each other not against the opposite sex. 

I think we have like one female who identifies as transgender winning against males - mostly this is natal males showing up female athletes.  

If female athletes don't boycott, we might need to hit advertisers.  Women earned Title IX for a reason, it's being destroyed by genderists."

About 30 years ago I was going on a trip and I asked all of my kids what they wanted me to bring back for them. One of my teenage foster daughters asked for a tarantula.

If she ""looked"" tough people would leave her alone. 
I managed to catch a tarantula while in N.M. and bought a little cage to carry it in. I covered the cage with a cloth. On the first two legs of my return trip, I had no problem. I told security (before TSA) what it was and then showed them. 
But, in LA, I was ""carried"" out of the security area by two huge security guards. The airline told me NO FLIGHT with the spider. I got my dander up and ended being kicked off the flight. I finally found a sympathetic airline who suggested I put it in my backpack and let a different security crew know ahead of time. Made it home a day later with it 🕷."

"Actually that's not my premise. The police are within their jurisdiction to approach ""sketchy"" individuals in a high crime area (or any area for that matter) and ask questions. The individuals have a right to provide a limited answer, or not to answer at all. They have the right not to show their I.D. Any further attempt to detain is a violation of Section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms. Police already have jurisdiction to pull over any moving vehicle for whatever reason they want. Technically it should only be when ""a constellation of objectively discernible facts...give the detaining officer reasonable cause to suspect that the detainee is criminally implicated in the activity under investigation,"" (sect. 9), not just ""I'm looking for a black perp and hey, you're black."" Keep in mind there is zero evidence that carding prevents or reduces crime, or leads to solving more crimes. Toronto Police could provide no evidence when asked by the Province."

Look at the Natives here. Who can honestly say the gov't has done a good job with them? Black people in the US, as a demographic, have actually seen their economics standings and quality of life decrease from the time of WW2, directly correlating with the rise in social programs that were designed to assist them."
"'His lawyer previously told the inquest that police fear of a black man clouded their judgment.'

Fear of a black man doesn't make sense to me.  If they fear so much how does one explain the thousands of carding incidences each year.  One cop, referred to as 'the terminator' had  66 hundred contact cards over a 4-year period....that doesn't suggest fear to me."

You may refuse service to a person because you don't like the color of his shirt.  But you cannot refuse service to a Christian, a Muslim, a woman, a black person, people with children, or a gay person solely because of their status.

Not much has changed."
"""Yet some wonky bakery owners don't want to bake a cake for 2 gay guys and this ends up with SCOTUS?""

Its ending up at the SCOTUS because, if you hadn't noticed, cases like this have been popping up all over the country - specifically surrounding businesses denying services to gay couples.  Can you name me another point in recent time when a specific group of people were being denied a service based on some inherent trait associated with them?  Obviously, blacks had a lot more issues surrounding rights and being treated equally than gays are now - but even allowing a little discrimination can open the floodgates to allowing all sorts of other things to discriminate against.

The President has a lot of power if he has the brain to use his power correctly.
The SCOTUS has a lot of power which depends heavily on who the sitting justices are at any given time.
Congress has a lot of power also, which again depends heavily on who has more seats.

"I think you are missing the point.  In your zeal to argue about median salaries and accuse everyone of being a liar you have derailed the conversation.  I am not suggesting that a HS kid is going to make $75K fresh out of high school.  I am suggesting that there is a very clear and direct path from starting in tech to a generally high paying family wage job that is well about the local median wage.    

These skills, if learned, are highly transferrable and can set our children on a path that opens up opportunities for them.  As for giving you a break, I, for one, am not going to give it.  Exposing children to code at a young age and demystifying the 'black magic' that happens behind the scenes is key.  Getting children to begin to think logically at a younger age is, in my opinion, a good thing.  Giving them a foundation to build on is the key."

"""If I'm reading the Pew article correctly...Nondenominational Protestants...Pentecostals... are underrepresented.""

Not really, MattinTX. Non-denominational Protestants and Pentecostals are always put under the generic label ""Protestant,"" in Congress. In Pew, Gallup and other pollsters, the ""Protestant"" label includes Evangelical, mainline, Pentecostal, and ""non-denomination"" along with any and all other non-Catholic, non-Mormon, and non-Orthodox Christian groups in between them and among them. Thus when Pew researchers say 46% of the US population identify as Protestant, for example, they put all of the above self-identified, highly diversified groups (in Congress, too) -- Evangelical, mainline, primitive Baptist, Southern Baptist, Black Baptist, Pentecostal, neo-Pentecostal, non-denominational Christian, etc. and hundreds more -- under the label ""Protestant."" Catholics, Mormons, Jews, NONES (more than 24%), Buddhists, Orthodox, Muslims, etc., make up the other 56% of the population"

A federal committee, appointed by Pres. Nixon, that looked into marijuana came up with a totally differently decision than what our country has experienced. The committee suggested that marijuana be legalized, but Nixon did not like hippies, black people or mexicans so the committee decision was thrown out."
"Most European countries were dictatorships at one time or another. Germany was a pretty solid dictatorship.

Well, the Judge was not alone/the only one.

"Indeed, those of us who supported President Obama had the rather naive idea that electing a President who shared our political/economic/social values AND who happened to be an AfricanAmerican just might help end the ""racial divide"" which has been present in the US since pre-colonial days.  Boy, were we ever wrong.  Instead, his election brought forth a tidal wave of racist rants...millions of internet posts....from individuals who saw the election of a Black President as ""license"" to share their racial hatred.  

Are we more racially divided than before President Obama's election....yes, I fear we are.

Is it his fault?  YES, it is...It's his fault for thinking (and our fault for supporting) the ideal that someone can actually be BLACK and be PRESIDENT.......It's our fault for underestimating the level of racial hatred which still exists among many Americans.

"They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.
Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.
It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.
Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper."

Segregation is part on human existence. Many segregate themselves by religion, by where they live, by who the vote for,  by their sports teams. Not every one here supports the Broncos. There are many different forms of segregation, and yes some involve race. However great strides were made to over come that with the election of Obama. However it didn't work out so well."
"""Did I lie about the Democratic Party""

Yes you did. A lie of omission is still a lie. 

You're entire argument is that the segregationist faction of the Democratic party is alive and well within the party today. That's laughably false, a rote repetition of propaganda and revisionist history. 

Abraham Lincoln once argued that slavery shouldn't be abolished outright. He also once proposed shipping all slaves to the island of Madagascar, & quite plainly spoke out against allowing black people to intermarry or vote. By your logic, all Republicans hold the same position today because it was once held in the past. It's asinine. 

Your 'respectfully' comments are just window dressing. If you respected yourself or sincere debate, you could express that through action by not sharing such facile thoughts with others. A waste of everyone's time. You might as well argue the color of the sky."
"The problem is naming institutions and streets after ""political heroes"".  My hero today, somebody's villain in ten years time. 
""If you are offended by the name of universities, you are not university material"". Put that view to Rhodes students and watch their reactions, and remember most of those students have never even lived under apartheid or colonialism.  A  street name in my suburb is called Hendrik Verwoerd but somehow most black residents (including me) in the suburb are more concerned about substantive things that affect their lives rather than street names. It is not that we do not care. It is that we have more important things to worry about like bonds, school fees, car instalments, alimony payments, services payment and having enough viagra to keep the Missus happy in bed (ok, disregard this one before people stat thinking that black men are permanently horny) etc."
"Wow! Great article Froma! Even Bernie, too! (more people in Seattle than all of Vermont - chuckle).
Now, carry on the discussion to H1-B Visas. Since those are issued where the US ""doesn't have those skills"" (yeah, right), and the big 3 or 4 in our local area are hurting our local economy by not hiring our own people, the following progressive proposal in line with Trump's hire Americans first:
For every H1-B Visa employee hired, the employer must hire an American to work with the person from the other country to learn the job. This, so that when the Visa runs out, an American is retained and employed. And, concerning Bernie's numbers, the American trainee must be from the pool of worst percentage, currently black Americans. Bernie says 51% which is very believable.
When was the last time Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Starbucks hired a black American for their $150K/year programming jobs? They fan the flames of employment discrimination, and stoke it with foreign coal as well."
"Tell the families of black men, brown men, and Native men murdered in broad daylight by police with not one ever convicted for the act that it is all ""racism-bigotry nonsense"".  Your libertarian movement will do nothing to fix the institutional corruption built into the current systems.  Libertarian is just anarchy dressed up in suit and tie without any real solutions to societal problems beginning with racism and bigotry."
"I have a very different view of the Dallas incident.  I think most Americans could not care less about the people needlessly killed by police because of their confront and control at any cost tactics.  Blacks are not the only victims of the carnage - witness Babb right here locally.  No people just don't care.  Note the standard response is do what the cops say and you won't be killed which completely ignores the adverse circumstances, fear, shock, and other factors that influence an individual's response when confronted by police.  Well, protests and calls for reform have led to nothing.  Now, with establishment lives on the line, I think we will finally see some serious consideration of what is wrong with police tactics.  Compassion is not in the play book of many Americans, but self interest is.  I think it took Dallas for many Americans to even consider that there is a problem.  Maybe now we can begin to work on solutions."

"When you speak of endangered birds are you referring to the Hawaiian petrel? If so, these rare birds are known to have colonies on Kauai, Lanai, Maui and Hawaii island--NOT here on Oahu--so this argument is moot.   As far as insisting that there should  be preferential treatment for native Hawaiian wildlife by killing off other animals such as free-roaming cats in order to protect them, this argument flies in the face of many Hawaii residents who staunchly believe Native Hawaiians should NOT receive preferential treatment despite the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by non-natives.  In fact, Native Hawaiians receive disparate treatment in Hawaii's criminal justice system just as African Americans receive disparate treatment in America's criminal justice system, serving longer prison sentences in comparison to other races.  So which is it?  Should we pick and chose which species are worthy of preservation while sending those whom we deem unworthy as sheep to the slaughter?"
"""Right of way"" doesn't mean much when you're dead. If I dress up in black and go jaywalk across the freeway at 3AM, sure, I technically have the right of way. But it would be pretty naive to deny that my own behavior contributed to my death when I'm inevitably hit by a driver, drunk or sober.

"Rename the University halls, yes. Get overly wrought over a law professor's dumb and insensitive (but well-meaning) black face stunt in her own home? Gimme a break. It's precisely this type of over-sensitivity, this misplaced rage and resentment, that keeps black issues from having the power they should and lends racists ammunition to call the entire civil right's movement ""political correctness run amok."" Message to the 12 protesters: pick your fights well. 
It would be nice if these ""leaders"" had acknowledged that their sector's own poor voter turnout is what allowed Donald J. Trump to become our president-elect. Perhaps getting out the vote would be a better use of these ""activists"" time?"
"Why are the Dutch riled up you ask ?

Despite being welcomed into Dutch society and freeloading off the  system, these immigrants instead of being grateful for a new life in the Netherlands,  complain about not being given enough welfare, feel it is their right to destroy public/private property at any perceived slight to their social, politicial or religious beliefs, and beyond this are commiting crimes, harassing and raping women, as in their backward culture and religion, women are kept behind closed doors only allowed out covered in black shrouds so as not to entice men.  Their views on human and women's rights and dress codes go back to the 7th century so forgot about them integrating into modern Dutch society.

The  Dutch PM  is now saying that he 'gets it' so that he can counter the potential vote shift towards Geert Wilders.   Too little too late.  The Dutch have tolerated years of inaction from their elected leaders and need to give them the boot before its too late."
An excellent question. I think further action is warranted. Don't you? I think Trudeau should show his commitment to diversity and step down and allow a woman to lead the Liberal party and Canada. A black bisexual FN lacto-ovarian vegan Woman. Perhaps with a disability or two. I mean come on Mr. Trudeau - put your money where your mouth is. Or are the rules about diversity just for everybody else?

"Null, I am the very first to decry ""running around calling everyone who disagrees with you a 'racist.'""  As one of the few conservatives on this site, I object to it at every opportunity.  And as far as BLM goes, I regard them as a hate-filled organization.  So you're preaching to the choir.  But you made a general statement --- a false one --- about how blacks die, and it impugned the race as a whole.  Breaking the law often does equate with hurting innocent people, but that alone does not justify the use of deadly force.  Your suggestion that it does simply gives ammunition to those who falsely allege the institutional acceptance of unjustified deadly force."
"Trudeau, a supposedly enlightened man, says his government has no intention of legalizing any drug besides marijuana.
But faced with thousands of deaths per year, it's apparent that the ethical contortions used to justify the continued prohibition of most illicit drugs are utterly without merit. 
When prohibition has been challenged in court, judges have ruled that government has a ""valid interest in protecting society"" via prohibition.
But when prohibition creates a black market controlled by criminal gangs, and exposes vulnerable addicts to (now massively increased) risk of death via unpredictable product, and considering the associated policing and health expenses... where is this ""protection"", and what is it costing us?
Finally, if drug use is a health issue, as even politicians increasingly suggest, then we should be looking at the health outcomes of drug policy -- and 2500+ deaths in a single year is about the worst policy outcome I can imagine.
End the drug war now."

"The irony of the left, now politicizing the mass shooting in Los Vegas, for more gun control laws, while supporting the right for NFL players to kneel during the National Anthem. What is the players complaint, that the police are shooting unarmed black males? Aren't the police, authority, and isn't the right to bare arms protection from authority, as much as it is from the criminal element? The ONLY gun control law that will satisfy the left is the elimination of ALL guns. Then when ONLY the authority, ie government, and the criminals have the guns, then what?"

Would you like to re-read what I wrote again?  How about I break the single sentence down into easier to chew spoon-fulls?
""That concept,"" meaning businesses being free to ""do what they want"" like discriminate against blacks.
That concept ""expired"" and is a dead concept as federal law prohibits it.  The same kind of law that states use to protect more than racial discrimination that prevent business owners to ""act any way they want at their own business.""

Do you get the point now?  Legal precedent is quite set and has killed any belief that business owners are free to discriminate based upon race, ethnicity, nationality, and under Anchorage ordinance sexual orientation."
"By golly you're right. I mean, there is no way any kid could form opinions or ask questions about anything political. It MUST be part of a conspiracy! Has to be part of the liberal agenda to defame any Repub amirite?

If you really cared about black lives, all black lives, you would focus your energys on fixing the dem party that has failed the blacks instead of using all your energy to further spread your hatred. You realize the dems are using you don't you? You do realize DT tried to help Chicago and try and save some black lives but RE refused right? Do you really like being used?

I can't argue that you don't perceive it as such, but I can question the validity of your perception. There are whole departments at the U of O where the professors do little more than identify racism in everything but the milk we drink."
"You really need to learn the history of those statues, the bulk of them went up in 2 main periods, the first being the Jim Crow period in the early 1900s, the second during the rise of the civil rights movement.

"I guess I am wasting my time here attempting to argue with somebody which has your shocking level of historical ignorance, but anyway. South West Africa was an SA territory, and being invaded out of Angola by Swapo terrorists. SA clearly had an interest in neutralizing a military threat in Angola, therefore.

He is not using the BLM as an excuse to riot and disrespect law enforcement. He is quietly taking a personal stand and I find his reasons to be commended. As a country we have an epidemic of LEO using excessive force and killing black Americans. There are good cops & bad cops. It's scary when someone with a weapon & a badge is being excessively physically aggressive because they are always ""right"". It seems like cops can say outrageous things and people will automatically believe them. It is a very helpless reality. Should he stand and pledge to a country that has an admitted history of prejudice and racial hate crimes? Should he pledge because he is a NFL player and not in the ghetto? How is this different from Rosa Parks? Martin Luther King?  It doesn't mean he isn't a patriot.

The baker is choosing to be offended. 

Is the baker going to ask people if they are gay before agreeing to make a custom cake?
He is being a petty child.

So what if you think the cake is art? I am not going to argue that with you. 
Do you think artists are allowed to discriminate?

If an artist sells to the general public, the artist can not discriminate against protected classes.
If the baker wins, it will be legal to discriminate based on religion. I guarantee you black people will be denied service somewhere on religious grounds.

"True Will ...the US was generally on the side of civil rights ...but the democrats weren't and still aren't.

""History reveals that every piece of racist legislation that was ever passed and every racist terrorist attack that was ever inflicted on African Americans, was initiated by the members of the Democratic Party. From the formation of the Democratic Party in 1792 to the Civil Rights movement of 1960's, Congressional records show the Democrat Party passed no specific laws to help Blacks, every law that they introduced into Congress was designed to hurt blacks in 1894 Repeal Act. The chronicles of history shows that during the past 160 years the Democratic Party legislated Jim Crows laws, Black Codes and a multitude of other laws at the state and federal level to deny African Americans their rights as citizens.""

"Richard,
To address the issue of disproportionate police shootings of African Americans, shouldn't one also address the issue that African Americans' criminal activity rate is far disproportionate to their representation overall in our population? To bemoan the former but forget the latter (which would certainly skew the former's statistical impact) seems rather imprudent. Perhaps both should be equally scrutinized and addressed to improve our national condition.

Another interesting statistic...roughly 95% of those suspects in which lethal force was used by police were armed.  How would you propose our ""amateurish and trigger-happy police"" (another fallacy not supported factually given the number of police contacts annually versus their use of lethal force in those contacts) respond? Do you also have any peer reviewed statistics to support your assertion that lethal force is utilized systemically by the police against POC in circumstances that they would not do the same to Caucasians?"

In countries like India, China, Africa they are no Christian. They are not obsessed with death, sex and marriage. Children are raised communally and in a village Overpopulation is not the problem as over globalization. The problem starts when everyone in Africa started buying western junk and living the western greed-dream. So this Canadian problem to promote abortion is very suspicious.

I'm sure there is a seed of ""truth"" in every expression sincerely seeking God, but since God alone is Truth, we'll NEVER know it all as we're simply not God.  Maybe since the Reformation...or maybe since long, long before organized, routinized, mandated Christianity, people clung to their own culture in living their lives.  It seems to me what we're dealing with is simply culture -- not dogma, not the Magisterium, not even Tradition -- but simply ways people feel more comfortable relating to the numinous as it speaks to them.

"Thanks for your kind words. I've appreciated our conversation, on this otherwise quiet thread. 

I don't disagree about there being a violent subculture, doing great harm within many Black neighborhoods.  Cliques of undirected and disenchanted young men and boys are one of the long-standing challenges of modern societies. Where a society understands those youths to be its own children and future, it tends to take seriously the job of engaging them productively. Where societies do not regard them as their own children, it's of little consequence what happens to them. 

Good luck with Anderson's book. She has a contentious thesis, but I think she does good work assembling an historically based overview. At the very least, it may give you a more detailed sense of the sorts of things people have in mind, when they argue the merits of taking an historical view of current conditions in Black communities, as I have tried to do here.

All the best"

And at one time in this country anyone who looked as though there was African ancestry - or Carribean ancestry - created a risk of being lynched. In Joe Arpaio's Arizona looking Hispanic subjected you to harassment. How come a drop of blood in your ancestry makes you subject to sanctions & humiliations but not having enough of a proportion of that ancestry divorces you from the so-called privileges of that ancestry.

"The 2011 Canadian voter turnout almost matches the Kenyan turnout this week. Yet you would not have said that the PM lacked a mandate & called for a 3rd election.Why is Kenya different?(1)As a hack for Odinga, your only road to victory is exhausting the electoral process then negotiating a power sharing deal (as Odinga had in 2008). 
(2)You say the West shouldn't wag fingers, but you call on Canada do that &more- envisioning a saviour that will ride in and save the good folk from big bad African presidents. How do you,or Canada,know what Kenyans want? A few chats with uber drivers & bartenders doesn't make u an expert. Kenya does not need a foreign saviour!
Western interference in African elections has never resulted in positive outcome for the working class. So we'll go thru the messy process of democracy ourselves, and chart our own future.

"I am very sympathetic to this woman's basic gripe -- I lived for many years in Thailand, and constantly engaging with people's stereotyped idea of what you should look like, how you should behave, what you should think, is annoying.  To have to do that in your native land and culture would be massively aggravating.

However, I think a lot of the problem here is that 'race' is a weird mixture of biology, cultural myth, and habit.  Biologically, it doesn't exist; socially, it does, and socially, being 'black' is one of the more charged identities.  My children, for example, are part American Mennonite and part Asian -- they'll get to work out what this means for them on their own, and the people they interact with will have minimal expectations.

As for the writer, what does she expect?  'Black' after all, is a visual identification; some people will depend on that, including some black people.  Many ethnic identities have certain signifiers, that some people meet easily, others not."

"""an extradition treaty would commit Canada to transferring fugitive Chinese officials to a country known for biased courts and harsh interrogation methods – and where the death penalty can be imposed even for non-violent crimes.""
Translation:  Canada aspires to become a safe haven for any and all criminals from any country we don't like, depending on the flavour of government we have in Ottawa.
But if 'prejudicial treatment' is such a big no-no, why are we extraditing anybody to the US? They have the death penalty, they use 'harsh interrogation methods', operate 'black sites' commit extrajudicial killings, still they snap their fingers and we jump.
Hypocrisy is at its best."
For a very long time it was a power differential between the two races that kept blacks out of professional sports. Would you have complained about that? What these anthem resisters are doing is trying to remind us that the differential is still around in this world.
Your post with a dumb generalizationa about all the people that support the blm support reparations disapeared. You keep doubling down on dumb generalizations. Your arguement is terrible and based on dumb generalizations. You do not speak for black people. Take two weeks off then quit.

"Does anyone actually have statistics on violence perpetrated upon blacks by 
cops ? And if we substantiate it , what are the reasons for it ? Is it really (solely) racism ? Or is it fear of violent black areas cops are forced to patrol ? Why can we not have dialogue about this without censorship ? Are we so afraid we might upset someone that we are not able to discuss it as adults ?"
"Correct: the failings of the black community are not the same as what has happened in the US. While an understanding of history seems weak these days, Canada was not a slave-owning economy and the vast majority of black people arrived in Caanda as migrants and free people in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Any failing since then that is discordant with similar migrant cohort experiences, is, I am afraid, there's to bear. The horrific crime and violence rate of the black community needs deep probing for its causes."

"Gays cannot be discriminated against. They are a ""protected class of people"" who cannot be discriminated against.

But, and this may be one of the issues, is ""offensive artwork"" ""people""? Do ""artists"" have the right to claim that ""offensive artwork"" they are being asked to ""create"" is ""offensive artwork"" and, therefore, is not a ""protected class of people""?
-
That logical reasoning is why a Jewish baker doesn't have to decorate a Nazi cake with Nazi symbols, why a Black baker doesn't have to decorate a cake showing a man being lynched by the KKK, or a painter doesn't have to paint a painting showing Hillary with horns.

It is wrong to discriminate against people.....but ""offensive artwork"" is not ""people"" and is not a ""protected class"" of anything."
"You're wrong, here's why. I have heard interviews with blacks who go by the statues, and are vividly reminded of slavery hurting their family for generations, and Jim Crow laws (laws discriminsting agsinst blacks long after the Civil War), and lynchings & killings by the kkk & other racists inspired by the statues. This is very real for some people, so it's just as if youbsaw a statue of Hitler (and your faamily was killed or in camps during the Holocaust), or Saddam Hussein (taking that statue down was important)  or Milosevisc, or Stalin. It absolutely does hurt real people, no matter what Hannity or Alex Jones says."

"""For Canada, private health care would take a tremendous load off taxpayers.""
.
""1..5 million declared bankruptcy in 2010 because of medical bills. That is .5% of Americans. The editors were desperate to make a point.""
.
With respect, 0.5% bankruptcies/year is huge.  They have dependents, spouses, siblings, parents, creditors ...  Any bankruptcy affects at least 10 people or entities.  Over the long term that is unsustainable.  It isn't 1.5 m people.  It is, effectively, 1.5 m households.
.
No, it wouldn't take an enormous load off tax-payers.
.
That is the whole point.
.
Health care is a problem of market failure and gross inequality of bargaining power.  It is a classic collective action problem, where government is needed.
.
US pays 17% of GDP.  Canada pays 10% of GDP, gets better overall results.
.
The savings is roughly C$ 4000 or US $ 3000 for every man, woman, and child in the country.  Single payer public health care would yield the biggest ""tax cut"" in American history."
"New to debate. Right. Not only did YOU quote the Texas Comptroller, but I read an article on which you relied. . . . which, by the way, cited Harvard's George Borjas, who is widely recognized as the top economist on immigration.  You WERE talking about the ECONOMICS of  immigration, weren't you? It's a mark of good debate to quote the best, provided your reader is up to it. I assumed you were, but I now see you're in over your head.  

As for refutation:  Your broad point was that illegal immigration is good for our economy.  My counter-point, citing Borjas, was that illegal immigration lowers the wages of the American poor.  You had no come-back, for the most part, but said only that ""the current unemployment rate is so low ... that any one who wants to work is working.""  That's false.  Unemp for black teens is 21%; for women over 50, finding a job is very difficult; for high-school drop-outs, unemp is about 7%.  About 14 million people who want work are unemployed."

Wow.  Let's see - how about  --- “No one has written your destiny for you,” he said, directing his remarks to “all the other Barack Obamas out there” who might one day grow up to be president ... ""Your destiny is in your hands, and don’t you forget that. That’s what we have to teach all of our children! *No excuses! No excuses!*""  

Can't hardly be more clear than that!  

Mr. Obama also scolded the black community to show a little more responsibility as parents and to encourage their children to do well in school - with the clear implication that those families where this doesn't happen, are setting themselves up for failure.  :-/
(He was right.)"
"Look, as a great American trying to make America great again (like he has been his WHOLE life), Trump has the duty, privilege, and fundamental right to pursue future deals.  With China being a currency manipulator, and Russia being seen as the ""enemy"", hotels in those countries may be difficult to justify.  It is the American way to help our coporations.  Cheney helped Haliburton.  The Bushes helped wall street investment banks in general.  People got rich!  America was great (until it suddenly wasn't - but that was Obama's fault because God saw horrid, black Obama was coming).  The key is what the Trump base knows.  Soon, once Trump makes America great again, and there are Trump hotels in all nations, members of the Trump base will also be rich, and have good jobs, and have better health insurance that liberals, and there will be no Muslims, and coal powered plants will make electricity free (for Trump supporters).  So, trust in Trump.  Support.  Quit crying just because Hillary lost."

I disagree with the black community laying sole blame on law enforcement without taking any responsibility for participation.

"Fannie Lou Hamer's suffering was by no means chosen as part of a calling, especially when she was arrested, sent to a prison and there nearly beaten to a pulp for trying to recruit and register black voters. She forgave those who had beaten her mercilessly, but by no means did she choose to be abused and dishonored that way. I also don't think Dr. King wanted his home bombed or his family terrorized. These were completely unjust and un-redemptive acts of hated. Both, however, accepted other people's cruelty and abuse with love. Both believed their suffering and openness to forgive would eventually win over their oppressors. They were holy people, truly engaged in the discipleship of Jesus."

"Just for info's sake. Yes, switchblades are now legal in Alaska and we pre-empt local laws against them just like guns, for the same reasons. The laws against automatic knives/gravity knives (and still criminalized brass knuckles, in fact) were based on fear of  latinos and blacks created by Hollywood, not any factual reason. They aren't faster to open than many folding knives, and are slower than a fixed blade, but less suited for use in harming people (weak hinge).

If you were to have a +/- 10 scale, all in all, Cherry would likely be in the ""+"" category. I personally would not rate him as such, but I am only one person.

He probably stated he knew what he was getting into as away of respect that he chose this honorable path as a self sacrifice.  Of course the family members are on a different paradigm.  They are grieving, going through anger (part of the grieving stages), women (often more emotional when grieving),and black (so may already predisposed to be anti trump, especially since he insulted Obama yesterday).  President Trump is learning the hard way that consoling loved ones is a difficult task.  Hope he can continue to stick with this role.  It will certainly defer him from commiting our forces to war needlessly."

The natural forces that affect climate change precede man.  The AGW theorists can't explain why we've had periods of ""global warming"" followed by increases in CO2 (to levels as high as 10,000 ppm) between each of the Ice Ages, long before man could have had anything to do with it.  During the time of the dinosaurs and other very large creatures, the Earth was covered with plant life growing prolifically during very high levels of CO2.  The Earth was a more accommodating place for life then than it is now.  Up to ten degrees warmer, too.

If we can't understand why it warmed back then under current AGW theory, why shoud be believe the theory applies now?"

"Like establishment Republicans everywhere the bishops expected Clinton to win the Presidency. They were looking forward, with their champions in Congress, to four years of nothing but fabricated scandal to occupy their time. They would 'rescind the ACA' knowing Clinton would veto the law but their base would be edified that their side was fighting their new target, a woman rather than a black man. Now the Republicans need to actually work and they are bereft of ideas as are the bishops. Look for the new ACA, 'Trumpcare' to only omit contraception or any family planning and of course abortion but remain essentially unchanged except in the way they describe its' coverage and implementation. And of course those most vocal against 'Obamacare' will embrace 'Trumpcare'. Same horse, different color."

Your attempt to belittle another human's understanding of this by using dog whistle words like ""politically-correct"" is disgusting and reprehensible.

3) Wrong.

4) Wrong.

5) Irrelevant what other ""goals"" the North had.  The main reason for this war was the fact that the secessionist did not want to give up their slaves, and were willing to dismantle a country over it,

6) The ""main issue of the war"" to Lincoln was the preservation of a nation.  The secessionists' insistence on keeping slavery, and their willingness to dissolve the union was the catalyst that caused him to have to act.

7) Agreed that the murder of Lincoln was tragic.  The rest of your diatribe was nonsense."

"The columnist is not very clear on HOW she thinks Hollywood has changed, in her eyes

I mean, is she trying to imply that, in past recent years, there was an unfair bigotry that refused to hand out awards to deserving black folks for their top-notch work? If so, what candidates were involved - which performance by a black actor or actress, which film by a black director, was unfairly overlooked in recent years?

Or is she trying to recognize that this year's award selectors were faced with a large number of black folks in prominent screen roles in successful films, and if so, did that arise because film producers afforded more funding this year for films involving black artists, or did it arise because audiences nowadays are more open to flocking to movies with prominent roles for black artists, or did it arise because the movies this year with black artists happen to have hit themes or narratives especially attractive to broad audiences?

It is actually kind of unclear what she meant."

"If you don't have any evidence that black voters in general agree with you - and you don't, or you would have provided it in your piece - you should speak for yourself, and not presume to speak for them as whole. In the real world, where most people aren't career Democratic Party hacks - Bernie Sanders gets his highest approval ratings from African-American voters. It's only an itty-bitty teeny-weeny little fringe of embittered job-hunters like yourself who blame Sanders for Clinton's failure. But, then, if you could read polls, you wouldn't have voted for a nominee with a 56% disapproval rating in the first place.

See ya in 2020."
"Who knows. Washington is a cesspool of rapists and crime like most large US cities.

"It is convenient to ignore the violence committed by the members of left wing groups like Black Lives Matter, ANTIFA, and to only highlight the Neo Nazi's (National Socialists).  Did Peter already forget about the violence that killed police officers at the hands of left wing radicals?  What about the guy who shot Republicans at a baseball practice?  Let us all pray this obvious violence, yes from the many sides of the left, ceases before neutral parties began to be hurt.  Reasonable people do not want to be forced to take a side, yet the media seems to be pushing people to pick a side.  All the violent groups are wrong."
"Ok... I hear you. But! The presidential campaign is only one item on your ballot. No you won't be able to go in a pop one button and be done. You will have to move through the whole ballot and choose those you can vote for. I have been where you are.  I remember weeping in the polling booth.But not for the reasons you describe.
I saw that I had lived to see every oppressed minority make it on to a presidential ballot. An African American - A Woman - A Catholic - A POW/Veteran.... I felt like a Mom asked to choose between her children as to which ones she loved best. I voted the rest of the ballot, contest by contest. 
Staying home and not voting really isn't an option because it dishonors all those who gave so much that I may vote. Even if you only vote for one contest on your entire ballot.... you can do that! I've been pained by the voting against rather than the voting for style of voting. So if there is only 1 vote for situation I can find -- then that's the only contest I vote in."

Yes - and the NRA has nothing to do with that kind of “advertising

The fact that Obama is black has nothing to do with it. He made no secret about his disdain for firearms going back to his time in the IL Senate and his anti-gun rhetoric continues to this day after every horrific killing before the bodies are buried. 

Re: “The greatest surge of civilian gun buying in the history of the nation”

You haven’t seen anything yet. If you think there were “huge sales” under a “black” president, wait until it becomes obvious Hillary is going to be the next president when she will have one or more SCOTUS appointees and makes no secret about her intentions to do everything she can to restrict the availability and private ownership of firearms."
"I'm sure you're a lovely person. I am too. But this is not about individuals in the present. Let me come at this by example. My great grandparents arrived from Germany, got farm land on the cheap, worked their butts off and made a healthy nest egg that got passed down to my grandparents. They, in turn, got more land on the cheap, and then benefitted handsomely from a federal government that assisted them through the depression of the 30s. My parents then went to college on subsidized loans, got public jobs, and built even more wealth bc the banks were nice enough to keep blacks out of the neighborhood. What all this means is that I stand to inherit a pile of money. Now look at my friend Warren, a black guy whose ancestors were just as hard working as mine. But his great grandparents were slaves, and after emancipation they were basically indentured servants. Local sheriff kept them from voting. His father served in WWII, but was prohibited from getting a mortgage. More after the jump."
"So, not all children who were forcibly taken from their families, kept in barely adequate housing and in many cases given barely adequate nutrition, punished for speaking their native languages, prevented from returning home for 50 weeks out of every year, made to assimilate into a foreign culture and indoctrinated with Christianity .. no, not _all_ of these children suffered abuse in the residential school system.

"If I were a black NFL player (making millions) I would take a position away from my workplace.

I would not father several children with various women and abandon my child-rearing responsibilities to the women and their mothers.  I would make it known that I do not admire anyone who walks away from his parental responsibilities.


I would encourage all young people to respect police and not default to an adversarial position.... the odds are that the police are not out to get you but it will go badly for anyone who is disrespectful to an officer doing his job."

"Obviously these ads don't have to come out and say ""Vote X"" but that seems to be the measure some are using to deny that they can influence an election or behaviour.

But aside from direct quotes, there's plenty of evidence to point to the fact he's racist, from the fact the he refused to rent to blacks in the 70's to his rants about Mexican and Muslim judges today.  The fact that he has consistently denigrated women in word and deed cannot be denied by any truthful person. Nor can the fact that he dislikes gays, made fun of a disabled man ( captured on video) and done and said countless other disgusting things.  

If you "" do not see where he has ever made any direct statements "" such as I and literally, everyone on the internet, who owns a television, tweets, reads and/or ownsany kind of media device whatsoever, then you are in true denial, the kind where a woman starving to death from anorexia sees a fat person in the mirror."

"Trump is more in touch than the far left and media

Results of the new NPR/PBS Marist poll are pretty surprising for we who have relied on the media to accurately report on the mindset of the country.

•A strong majority (62 percent) of Americans favor leaving the Confederate statues standing as historical markers

•The only group with a majority favoring removal (57 percent) are “Strong Democrats”

Among self-described Moderates, 67 percent favor leaving the statues standing. 

44 percent of African-Americans polled believe in keeping the statues standing. Of Latinos, 65 percent believe the statues should remain."
"I'm worried about:
1. Teachers and management at private schools being vulnerable to inappropriate meddling by wealthy parents.
2. Due process being brushed aside by opportunistic policitians.
3. A punitive approach to racists, who need re-education in the spirit of Nation Building, rather than isolation and rejection.
4. Second class education, especially maths education, that's still dished up to black children by the Gauteng Education department which is far more damaging to black advancement than racist language or ideation by a very small minority of teachers, and which doesn't get anywhere near the same attention by the social and formal media."
"Perhaps the antichrist is the papacy itself.

"The FREEDOM of Kaepernick to not stand with hand on heart during the playing of the national anthem is exactly what the flag represents.   

And the national anthem is a particularly relevant symbol for his protest of what he perceives as the unfair treatment of people of color in America.  The anthem was written by the slavery supporter Francis Key during the War of 1812.  During that war the British army enticed black slaves to join them in fighting their American masters.  This explains the last four lines of the third verse of the anthem...

From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave,

"The repeated use of the term 'blacklisting,' a term used to describe racially-based discrimination by primarily private parties, such as realtors, is blatant intellectual dishonesty. An appeal to emotion which has no place in a rational discussion involving the exercise of what may be a political right (yet to be determined by a Court) and multiple economic and political realities.

Since the practical and economic issue at hand has to do with residence, not race; that one side of the issue is relying on emotional BS while utterly ignoring the clear economic and practical problems means that no rational person should take them seriously until they come up with an intellectually serious argument."

The irony is that the very poor including many blacks and hispanics are the groups who in mass vote for the Democrats, Progressives, Socialists....whatever you want to call them!  The middle class thrived under Reagan and even Clinton but that reversed when Bush took office and then exponentially worsened when Obama took office.  History has shown that no matter how high you raise the minimum wage nothing really changes as the price of living just adjusts up to a higher number of dollars.  Minimum wage is not meant to give the entry level worker a standard of living out of line with their skill levels.  The success of this country is in providing OPPORTUNITY,  not end results.  Hard work is the answer to providing better results!  HARD WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!! When November comes, Don't vote for anyone who says he or she will provide everything in life for FREE! There is NO FREE!"

Hard work and the realization no one can help you like you can help yourself.
When the majority of the gun violence is from the black community, maybe the investigation should start there and stop dancing around the subject.  At some point, with the social security net provided by this province, when the violence doesn't improve, we have to start looking at cultural behaviors as the root cause. I doubt many of the people participating in this behavior have 12 hours shifts at the factory to do before they go out and shoot up a street."

When rural people fall on hard times they don't start crying for another government program to take care of them ... they look at each other and they look first at themselves first. Secondly, rural people may seem poor to a stranger looking from outside but most of those families think they live blessed lives and even find a way to give to other people. Poverty is a state of mind and people are responsible for their own happiness ...not the government. Don't you see how the left uses black people every 2 years then kick them to the curb in favor of the next up and coming victim class ...Hispanics!"

"The idea that Jefferson thought of blacks as only 5/7 human is, of course, a canard.  The representatives of the Northern States were trying to have a union without slavery, and they rightly resented the Southern States have slaves be represented the population for purposes of national representation, when they weren't even free and couldn't vote in State elections.  It was like allowing California's illegal alien population to count toward how many representatives it should be allowed in Congress.  So they reached the 5/7 compromise."

"I recall when Bush was seen as too slow off the mark during Katrina and New Orleans native and once DNC chair Donna Brazile (the one who later leaked debate questions to Hillary before her 2nd debate with Trump) went ballistic castigating Bush for every conceivable and inconceivable problem connected with the relief and reconstruction of New Orleans.

The usual left wing suspects were happy to pile on.  Some like Puff Daddy went so far as to accuse Bush of racism and not caring about New Orleans because it was majority black.  (How Puff Daddy squared this with Bush's billions in aid for Africa was never revealed.)

Years later, after Bush was out of office and Obama was in office, Donna Brazile apologized profusely to W. saying nobody was a stronger and more generous supporter of the reconstruction of New Orleans than George W. who ""kept every promise he made to us"".

"The two perpetrators in this killing were immediately arrested, charged and have now been convicted.    BLM protests police killings of un-armed black people because the perpetrators in those killings DON'T generally get arrested, charged or convicted.  See the difference?"
Do you ever see black helicopters?
I find the most hatred directed at people of colour comes from WASPs. And I'm not familiar with Greece or Spain. Aren't we discussing North America? Besides the WASPs I know would describe Spaniards as black people. So I'm not sure how that improves your argument.
"So, an American black man wearing a ball cap for Chicago is yelling in the face of a Canadian man holding up a sign to stop the illegal entry to Canada.  (you know, abide the law - apply through the front door)

That man doesn't look peaceful in that photo nor acting Canadian.

Are we supposed to accept people who demand entry to Canada just because they breathe air?"
"Jesse Jackson now blames ""the suppression of the Black vote"" for Trump""s win. He, like many race leaders in America, are just racists making a buck.  Two months after the election and he decides to add an extra dose of  damnation for Trump.  But the media will accept it and say  ""Oh Yes Mr Jackson, you  are so wise"". despite no corroborating evidence or  complaints anybody was denied their vote. ."
"So you're saying the officers in Seward do their job. That's good. As far as these particular people being blown away by the scenery? Not likely. It was 1:40 am according to the report. That means it was just pitch black outside here in AK. No, I think they were just speeding. Come to think of it, going fast is something people on meth do really well."
"Re-read my comment. I did not ""accuse"" Mr. Miranda of anything. I simply stated that being a Person of Color (Puerto Rican/Latino in Mr. Miranda's case) doesn't not automatically mean that said person cannot possibly take part in a system of racism and violence. I even cited two prime examples."
"If criminal behavior in the Black communities of Canada and The US  were in proportion to it's portion of the population,  3% and 8% respectively,  the number of police shootings would follow suit. But you won't change your behavior so you blame racism for the differences between your relations with police and the rest of society."
"Kapernick's problem is that he - like the BLM racist crowd he fell into - conclude ""police brutality"" without bothering to wait for the facts of the case to emerge before making a decision as to what happened.

BLM was founded on the Michael Brown ""hands up don't shoot"" lie and in spite of that Wilson was totally vindicated and the originator of the ""hands up don't shoot"" lie - Dorian Johnson - not only recanted that false claim under FBI scrutiny, but already had a previous conviction of providing false information to police, these cop-hating racists ran with it anyway and presumed Wilson to be guilty before and even AFTER proven otherwise.

These people are not interested in facts; they are interested in attacking police and racially rabble-rousing. Furthermore, until recently, ""peaceful"" BLM was allied with the violent Marxist organization Antifa which has physically attacked police.

I'm sure BLM is still getting funding by Soros, since such people are right up his alley."
"Oh, I get it just fine. As long as it's a bunch of criminal gang-bangers, preferably black, killing each other off, no reason to get exercised about it.  After all, you don't hang out in the hood, so no big deal. But Las Vegas hits a little too close to home. It reminds you that indescriminate violence can reach out and touch you, too."
"But despite the update, the article still makes no sense.

"The Republican/Trump purges continue.  First, purging voter rolls of those unworthy black, hispanic, democrats, non-christians to rig the entire election process.  Next, Trump's election and Congress Republican control to prevent any government functions at all.  Next. fail to fill all of the vacancies for the positions necessary to actually operate the government.  Next.  Purge all scientists from all departments to be left empty to accomplish the same thing.  Time for a Revolution."
"I don't know if everyone heard Obama during his campaigning but I heard the threats being made by a community organizer regarding how he was going to transform this country. I took those threats seriously. 
I understand how the illegal aliens, the BLM (black lies matter), Occupy protesters, the Muslim community idolized Obama and his vision of the US. But there were others that didn't like what Obama did to this country."

"Every week we get comment from Diko, a spokesperson for the ANC W Cape. It is getting tiresome and clearly the guy has nothing much to do! Perhaps he should take up walking.... into the countryside! 

As for the issue on Zuma and his shuffling of Cabinet, it is his prerogative rational or not. As for rationality, well he kept Dlamini and Muthambi as well as a string of others, and removed a couple of 'clever blacks'.... behaving rationally, from his viewpoint, probably..... a sensible viewpoint, definitely not!"
"I think we still have a need for both affirmative action and active enforcement of the Civil Rights Act because racial prejudice is still ""alive and well in America"" and discriminatory acts based on such prejudice are still all too commonplace.  

When President Obama was elected many of us optimistically thought we might be entering a era of ""post racist"" America.  Boy, were we ever wrong.  President Obama's election, instead, brought the racists out from under their rocks and, somehow, seemed to invite open hate-filled comments and attacks we hadn't seen in decades....it became ""open season"" for racists and tens of millions of hateful racist posts are on the internet.  Websites have been established for the express purpose of publishing such posts.  

Of course ""it's all President Obama's fault""...well, maybe, after all he did have the nerve to be an African American and to be elected President.....""how dare he!""  

We're a long way from that ""post-racial (and racist)"" America."

"In the bizarro world psyche of internal Democratic thinking, women aren't ""women,"" and African-Americans aren't really ""black,"" unless they are left-liberal-progressive advocates of the ""living constitution"" (i.e., the text of the U.S. Constitution means exactly what we say it means, no more, no less, the meaning and intent of the Founding Fathers be damned)."
"What a well thought out argument! I guess if you're going to protest, it helps to have the full picture.  The numbers don't lie. But neither do they exist in a vacuum. I don't believe there's a conversation in reality or in theory that will make a difference regarding the inarguable racism in the US. There were slaves in Jamestown a decade before the Puritans arrived. By the time Martin Luther King, Jr. was marching for civil rights in the 1960s, either legal or de facto economic slavery and legal or de facto murderous open violence toward Black people had been going on for over 350 years. I know, ""look what they do to themselves and us"" appears makes sense if you look at crime stats from 2015. How we got where we are has been a very long time coming, and we aren't here because good people died in the mud for equal rights, as noble as that sounds.   We're here because far more people died under far worse conditions for a very long time, and this isn't a values debate about ideals."
"My only problem with the bill is the length of time for nondisclosure, and the subsequent extensions allowed.

You couldn't pass a citizenship either. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. (No racist.)
"Always need help?? No, not always, but at this point they do.  Social programs were not african american programs, the majority of poor are not african american."
"People who have more brains that God gave a rutabaga understand that the Three-Fifths Compromise was an accomplishment by the Abolitionists to give the slave states LESS power in Congress by reducing the number seats in the House they'd get by 40%.  More power to the slave states would have meant less power to black people enslaved in those states.

And, by the way, it wasn't illegal to secede.  The New England states (and New York) considered seceding for ten years, and no one ever suggested they couldn't.  Ending Slavery wasn't Lincoln's objective; collecting taxes from the South was.  It was only later than he made freeing the slaves an issue by issuing the Emancipating Proclamation, which didn't actually free any slaves, because it only applied to the Confederate States, who didn't recognize his authority.  The Slaves weren't freed until the ratification of the 13th Amendment.  Tens of thousands of Union soldiers deserted when Lincoln issued that proclamation."

"When Boy-Roy can't refute facts (which is pretty much all the time), he resorts to absurd personal attacks and usually gets it wrong.  It took my pointing out that (A) I'm Muslim and (B) everyone in my immediate family except my second-youngest granddaughter is visibly ""black"" before he'd back off from accusing me of voting for Trump (in fact I voted for neither of the two ""mainstream"" candidates because there's no point doing so when neither evil is the 'lesser').  His latest accusation is that I am a climate-change denier (and of course nothing could be further from the truth).  Really, Boy-Roy's posts taken in their entirety amount to little more than online shrieking an flailing."
"Perhaps we should not have sold our manufacturing arm to China and India, at what price, I wonder.  I have heard of actual cases where imports of African manufacture were stopped because the Chinese had preference.  Perhaps our government's trade negotiations should come under the spotlight before we plan more manufacture that will simply fail because we cannot compete with Chinese and Indian slave labour and ""dirty"" coal powered manufacturing tactics."
"Obama's policies have destroyed the economy here, in Texas, and everywhere. Black unemployment has doubled. Around the MatSu there's a higher than average amount of shuttered businesses.

"It's no question that misinformation, civic ignorance and apathy is abound in our society, and is a pressing issue of our time. Just as there is no denying that populism can sometimes lead to negative outcomes.  But I challenge you to find any evidence that voter suppression and disenfrachisement produces more beneficial policies and representatives for the populations that have their voices suppressed. Less voter turnout will always lead to less policy emphasis on the needs of a particular population. The founders intended the citizenry to vote with their passions, that's why they designed a system of checks and balances and representatives to make decisions on our behalf. But denying blacks the right to vote did not lead to racial equality, and denying women the vote did not lead to gender equality. Society just doesn't work that way."

"Apparently you speculated that :

1. That MarkBee1 is black.  I didn't give it a thought or know his/her race.
2. From your speculation you then decided my comment was racist.

Sorry, the Urban Music Awards don't ring a bell. I'm a Rolling Stones, Eagles and fan of classic rock. Come to think of it the Stones had a song (Miss You) that mentioned a ""Puerto Rican girl"". 

I play poker on Thurs nights and one in our group is African-American.  I'll explain the context and ask if my comment would have been offensive to him - seriously. You've  piqued my interest."
"If Republicans are so racist, why did they nominate a black man, Daryl Glenn, to run for Senate in Colorado?  Or vote for Tim Scott (So. Carolina) to take a Senate seat?  

In one Sat. morning in October, I heard Coleen Hanabusa state to Mike Buck and Gary Galligher (now deceased) that Republicans were against Obama because he was black.  That kind of thinking is called ""projection"" and indicates the speaker is actually stating their own prejudice by throwing it on their opponents."

"What reason does anyone have to possess a firearm? What reason does a black person have in not wanting to be relegated to separate but ""equal"" facilities? Economically speaking, prohibition causes crime. First, it makes what would otherwise be legal, illegal. Second, it creates an economy void of the protections (courts and manners of redress between two parties in an economic transaction) that facilitate an organized and civil society. Three, it creates both scarcity and demand, which, in turn, cause prices to rise and the ensuing crime to acquire the ability to pay the higher prices for the good being demanded."
"""mass desecration project""

Let's put some perspective on this indignation to the Hawaiian injustice.

Humans have a long history of repugnant injustices. Here's a short list starting with Genghis Khan invading Europe, then the Muslims, the African slave trade, the Armenian genocide, the genocide of the Jews, the Jewish persecution of Palestinians by evicting them, the Soviets in eastern Europe, the grievous abuse of Australian aborigines and N. American Indians, US invasion of Philippines during the Spanish American War, the murderous invasion of SE Asia and China by the Japanese, Rwanden genocide, the US invasion and destruction of Iraq...

Today, the US is belligerently beating the nuclear war drums with Russia and China, while everyone is destroying the earth's climate - that's the mass extinction and planetary desecration project we should all be concerned about. I do believe."

"The overwhelming majority of the black Monday protestors were not racist. It is the likes of you that try and portray them that way. 

You are joining The New Age in crass labelling. Do some introspection.

Get a life."
"“Do you want some grits?”

This comment has absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone's race.  The woman who reported this is completely mistaken in assuming that it is a comment which has any reflection whatsoever on one's race.  Grits are standard fare in the southern parts of the USA.  Grits are NOT eaten, as she seems to assume, only by African-Americans.  Grits are eaten by EVERYBODY.  To judge that a comment about grits is a racist comment is nothing less than profoundly a ignorant judgment.  To judge that speaking a phrase or a sentence with a 'southern accent' is a racist act is also nothing less than a profoundly ignorant judgment."
"Why don't they focus their antislavery  fervour on the continuing African slave trade in Africa and Islamic ME.  Chad, Mauritius,  Guyana, Qatar, Saudi Arabia Yemen, Ethiopia and even Indonesian all have the continuous black African slave trade that has been ongoing for thousands of years.   But nobody wants to talk about it. They  prefer to denounce Canada, which never had a slave trade."
I've read that a lot of southern black men were carrying guns during the civil rights movement. I know the Black Panthers did. I'm sure they needed them for protection.
"You seem to be implying that African-Americans are not rational, civilized people who understand the concepts of free speech and rule of law. If so, don't be coy. Spit it out.

By the way, the Jewish Defense League seems to have not gotten the memo about how they're supposed to eschew violence. I'm sure they'd welcome some guidance on the matter."
Black Lives Matter is Wrong about Banning Police You Can't Tarnish a whole Police Force because you didn't like the actions of one or two members. Police are For our Protection.
"LOL...your comment reminded me of Super Dave, the comedian stunt man.  He'd dress up like a stunt man (fire-proof suit, helmet, etc.), then do something really dumb.  In one episode, he walks down an alley to where a bunch of black guys are pitching coins against a wall.  He stops in the middle of them and starts yelling ""N.....r!!!"".  They beat the heck out of him.  Had me cracking up."

"I'm a legal immigrant, and a citizen. The most prominent outcome of this election, and that of the prior two before this present one, is that in the prior two all was quiet on the streets of the USA with no crybabies protesting, no one kneeling at the Anthem, no broken windows or fire bombs into the doorways of the self employed, no crybabies on campuses needing therapy dog visits, no grade schools being let out so the little children can protest the new ""duly elected president"".
No, the last elections were quiet though nearly as many were all too aware of Obama's failures at getting us out of war, at closing down coal mining communities, and leaving them financially high, and dry yet at the very same time handing out financial aid to illegal immigrants and refugees, he nearly let the VA become a thing of the passed, and in plain words, abandoned the inner cit, black ghetto. Need I say more? 
Grow up, and cut with the crying. Give this Trump fellow a chance. We gave Obama 8 years!"
dumass got himself killed. now we have to go through the because im black excuse. cops have no idea what he reached into his truck for. idiot should have laid down soon as the guns came out. you dont ignore cops or anyone with a gun drawn. stupid idiot would still be here if he knew how to listen. his own damn fault no pity from me. good ridance.
Barack was as big a racist as Trump.....blaming the murdered police and making excuses for those blacks who murdered them.

They couldn't hold their noses tightly enough to go to the polls and vote for Hillary."
"I thank those Latino groups for pulling that ad because it shows the Confederate Flag in a false and negative light.  The vast majority of neo-Confederates (myself included) DON'T discriminate against minorities.

We gladly welcome any racial minorities who support our Southern Cause!"

"As a born and bred New Orleanian, a Catholic, and a conservative, I have to say thank you to my co-Yats, Jake Berry and Mitch Landrieu.  Jake especially, living in the Carrollton section, knows what it's like to ride downtown on a streetcar and come to a rail-screeching, 270-degree crawl around Lee Circle before heading down Carondelet towards Canal.  Like me, he got to know and love Lee Circle, a landmark revered for its beauty since long before either of us was born.  Jake probably saw Lee Circle --- not just the statue of Lee that sat atop the tall, elegant pedestal, but the entire circle --- as one, integrated piece.  But Jake also knows that this piece of beauty was not just a sculpture, but to most black New Orleanians, a monument to military genius employed on the side of oppression, a symbol of defiance in the face of good.  To most black New Orleanians, his statue was reasonably seen as the equivalent of a statue of Hitler or Stalin.

they forgot to put in the real reason rod went up there to introduce himself and ask him to slow down because he had run people in the ditch..and they were all neighbors that lived on the road that were very concerned about  his driving.and my understanding is the black gentleman got all racist with the neighbors. Rod has lived in that area for many years with no problems.the black gentleman has lived there a very short time and is already causing lots of problems with the neighbors...which iam one of them so I have seen it first hand.

"Is asking people to vote for you because you're a woman msewxism??  I wouldn't call it ""sexist"",  here's a definition for you:  Sexism or gender discrimination is prejudice or discrimination based on a person's sex or gender. Sexism can affect any gender, but it is particularly documented as affecting women and girls.[1] It has been linked to stereotypes and gender roles,[2][3] and may include the belief that one sex or gender is intrinsically superior to another.[4] Extreme sexism may foster sexual harassment, rape, and other forms of sexual violence.[5]  from Wikipedia

"I've had some very good relationships with black people in my life, through sports, the military, college, and business.  Most of them have assimilated very well, and live a quality middle class life.  They stayed in school, got a job, improved their skills, and didn't have kids out of wedlock or commit crimes.  It's that simple.  It's not about race.  It's about character.

But the Democrats' welfare programs gave them the wrong incentives.  In 1965, the #1 cause of poverty in the black community was single moms, which stood at 17% of births at the time.  So, the Democrats decided to reward being a single mom, and now it stands at 73% of births in the black community.  The system also penalizes them of they get married, or if a kid under 25 gets a job, and they wonder why the unemployment rate in the black community is so high.  The only way a kid can help the family with more money is thru crime; a paycheck reduces mom's benefits!"

"“The idea that it should take more than a bare majority (of lawmakers) to raise taxes is a key part of the American identity,” he [Davis] said.

Oh good grief! Did the American identity begin with Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann of Southern California in 1978? That's when this nonsense of requiring super-majorities to raise taxes started. 

Why can't people on the right wing be honest? Must they always attempt to rewrite history, like when they claim the statues to the Confederate traitors weren't place during the Jim Crow era for the purpose of intimidating black citizens?

These proposals are nonsense on their faces. Corporations have seen their share of the tax burden shrink dramatically over the past quarter-century, and now they want to lock in their unfairly low payments. I hope my fellow citizens see through this game."

"Meanwhile what became of the people captured by JTF-2? We know the army gave their prisoners to the Afghans where they were abused and anyone in country knew they would be abused. That was wrong for a bunch of legal and practical reasons but we've ignored the question of SOF prisoners.

Presumably the people they detained were of higher value than run of the mill Afghans and JTF-2 was part of an American commanded SOF Task Force.  These prisoners must have been considered of some intelligence value so where did they go? Libya? Poland? Which black site were they taken to in order to be tortured into giving up information? 

Or did JTF-2 arrange it's operations so someone else ""captured"" the prisoners? I'll also accept that they didn't capture anyone- a sign of inaction or a ""take no prisoners"" policy although I find the latter unlikely."
"All errors are not on one side.    Outright resentment of higher levels of education is not unusual in any society.

We would not have a United States of America without the leadership of elite men, (wealthy and educated), men who understood the challenges, the gifts, the weaknesses of those wtih elite power worldwide.  Jefferson would be the poster boy for the 'elite' although he was hardly alone as a cornerstone of the developing political movement in the American colonies.     Elite can also be a very positive attribute.    

I like your comments, just a caution against stereotyping character types, including the elite."
"Blacks are always suspect and can be shot on sight by police for mere suspicion of being armed. This happens in even open carry states. It happens hundreds of times a year nation wide. Many criminals get their guns by way of gun shows in red states, sometimes using ""straw"" purchasers. The NRA has helped facilitate these sales by fighting every gun control law. For example, most guns in Chicago are bought in Indiana where the gun laws are much more lax than in Chicago. BTW, The NRA even fights research into why we have so many gun deaths. The police live in  fear because they know there are enough guns in the population for every man, woman, and child."
"So let me get this straight, Republicans will vote for a corporate shill reality show star bigot who has insulted every walk of life including a gold star family, but chastise a man practicing his freedom of speech because he's half black and not a patriot? Hmm."
"The rationale I'm reading from commenters is truly astounding.  Gays and blacks feel the need to protest their historical treatment at the hands of police.  That is your democratic and constitutionally protected right.

And these commenters are saying, they have no right to protest, and police should now react with retribution for being excluded from the parade in this protest move.

Wow."
"The Bear/menstrual nexus IS real, at least for Black Bears. If you cannot defend yourself in the backcountry, stay home. When you enter the forest, you are part of the food chain, but not on top!! Smoked Bear jerky is not too bad. Happy hunting."

"I can't wait until the 555-foot Washington Monument is toppled, brick by brick, because Washington was a racist slave owner. I can't wait until the Jefferson Memorial is bulldozed over, because Jefferson was a racist slave owner.  I can't wait for MLK's statue to be destroyed because he was a racist who only advocated for blacks.  I can't wait until all references to Jesus are removed because some people don't agree with Christianity. So I guess we see where this destruction is going?"
"Another example of the LaLa land atmosphere in Universities. I am not aware if there is systemic discrimination against Black students at Massey or UofT requiring the ""fulsome transformation"" the petition requires. Not sure if Marrus had any history of picking on Black students. If neither assumption applies (which I trust is the case),  the Dean should have reprimanded Marrus in a meeting with him and the student involved,  and then told the campus that Marrus had apologized and that his long history of distinguished service unblemished by any suggestion of racism justifies the institutions' acceptance of Marrus' explanation of making a joke (tasteless and offensive as it was). End of story. It's not a story about political correctness; its another story of spineless administrators failing to stand up to a bullying group of students."
"Wrong, fuzzylogic.  Boy did you pick the right log-in name.  The Democrat Party was never affiliated with the KKK and history has proven that fact.  Yes, there were MEMBERS of the KKK that were Democrats but that's a far cry from saying it was the Democrat Party that originated the KKK.  Since those early days, all of the KKK members have since switched to the Republican Party.  It's laughable that Strom Thurmond was a KKKer and he impregnated one of his families house slaves, even fell in love with her.  Storm secretly accepted and embraced his black daughter.  He even paid for all of the college.  One of his grandson's became a doctor and Strom even paid for his medical training.  There's no doubt that Strom supporters knew about his black daughter and his black grandchildren, but that didn't matter.  Supporters kept sending him back to Congress until he finally dropped dead."
"Oh right, because them ""lying""  about Soros has nothing to do with his political, fiscal and legal influence. Might be worth asking yourself, why soros is funding black lives matter though OSF. If you think for a minute it's out of the goodness of his heart, you're not worth arguing with."
"Important point Westslope, additionally the supposed reason to take a knee is to protest the ""inequality"" in the U.S. today. 
This, of course, coming from Black players that make up 75% of the players in the league, and make millions of dollars a year!
I think they should start ""equality"" by giving me half of their millions net worth just to make us, you know, equal.  Then we should implement an affirmative action program that will require owners to only employ ""others"" until at least 50% of the players are non-Blacks.
Then we can go to the NBA were 11 out of 13 players on every team are Black.  This is a clear sign of discrimination and racism being perpetuated against ""others"" and must again have a affirmative action program mandated and a hiring freeze put in place until at least 7 out of 13 players in the NBA are others, (penalizing the teams by one player to cover past racist transgressions).  Lebron should give me half of his earnings too, so, ya know, that we are ""equal""."
"Let me explain to you the Democrats ""better deal:""

1. Open Borders and Sanctuary cities
2. Identity Politics: You are the color of your skin and nothing more
3. Political Correctness:  Any speech we don't like is hate speech
4. Gender: You can be whatever gender you want and use any bathroom you want.  Chromosomes don't matter.
5. Global Warming:  We must immediately end the use of all fossil fuels and destroy all energy intensive jobs.  the only people that can use fossil fuels are democrats.
6. Black lives matter and nobody else matters.  Police need to be terrorized.
7. If you don't believe all of the above then you must be killed or sent to a re-education camp"
Wonderful piece! I love your honesty and examples of what girl scouts has meant to you.
"Another case of racism that people in the conservative camp will not deal with.
Got a news flash for Trump, Klan and others; black community and brown community fastest growing in North America. Deal with it!"
Trump is back in Houston. Another do-over to masquerade as a descent human being. I saw him lift and 'air kiss' a small black child. He can't even fake empathy.
"Eeeww.  Stop draining the swamp!  Fill it back up!  The slimy black guck at the bottom smells very, vey bad."

"I don't see anything through a theory at all. I know plenty of people like you, and I think you're ruining the country. That's not a theory, its my experience.

You have no clue what the cultural background of the people of Norway is. All you know is that black and latino 'thugs' are dangerous and need thick concrete. That's why I call your post racially motivated.

Norwegians are pretty similar to us and I challenge you to point out one of these differences you keep going on about."

"There's a difference in why grey hairs might enjoy staying where what they share with the new guys and gals is respected.  Some places, retirement is a more attractive situation."
Blacks are intellectual inferiors even to Mexicans!
"But the thing is, Trump cannot make money. He's barely managed to hang onto the money he was born with. So if you want to vote a candidate based on how she makes money, you better vote for Hillary because she's made a boatload of money without immediately losing it to bankruptcy or failed ventures as Trump has done. 

I think Hillary has probably netted more money than Trump, so I'm just fine with this principle of voting for the best businessperson. But Republicans don't honestly want to do that, this ""business"" approach is just a desperate ploy to try not to admit they want to vote the racist and sexist line. They just are freaked out that a black man won the Presidency last time and they're going to absolutely implode when a woman wins it this time."
What's next on the protest calendar? LGBTQ2+ first nations BLM environmental activists for vulnerable children?
"Trump throw the red meat to his base, vile them up, elicit response from everyone else is exactly where he wants things to be.  The divider-in-chief has done it again - pitch people against people, make people take side so to strengthen his base and distract his lack of major achievement so far in his presidency.  Personally I can't see how 'kneeling' is offensive, which I feel is a gesture of compassion with a degree of sadness.   Just watch Jackie O kneeled before the coffin of JFK during the funeral, nobody said she was being offensive.  Colin K started this gesture to protest against the police brutality against black, a sad state of affairs.  Agree with him protesting during the anthem or not, by doing so he is making a bigger impact to raise the issue.  Now Trump is making his cause (and kneeling as a form of protest) a lot bigger, perhaps an unintended consequence unforeseen by this destructor."
"Cleverly worded phrases such as: ""Community Unity Rally set for Saturday in Kent in response to Sikh shooting"" actually states the opposite to its claim of unifying the city, and in truth creates a political divide within our culture. What other purpose would their be to even mention the word Sikh? As though if I were NOT an immigrant, or NOT of African decent, or NOT part of an LGBT organization, that violent crime would somehow hold less value within a community?

We are also currently witnessing one of the largest National Debates on immigration reform in recent US history; as well as the progressive left demonizing anybody for daring to speak out against illegal immigration in the first place. I view this rally as simply another attempt to support the false narrative that borders are unique to the modern world , or that believing in sovereignty for ones country is really aligning ones self with Nazism."
"People voted for DJT for many reasons and it is my observations that most votes for DJT were emotional ones and not ones based on sound facts on his policies.  First off, he never gave many policies except what he was going to end.  None on moving forward.  Many are racist based/a true hatred that a black man ran the country for 8 years and NO...I do not think O was the best president but he usre looks awesome now, lol.  

The lack of sound journalism based on presenting facts and NO opinions but letting folks use critical thinking.  People blamed big gov and sadly?  The most vocal on this stance will be impacted the most by having this troll in the WH.  

People should listen to NHK World radio for their news as well as BBC and DW Germany.

Sorry for all this Steve.  I forgot I was responded to you instead of a clean comment.  My bad.  Have a great day"
"Riiiight! According to you, black and Hispanic Christians vote Democratic because they're all on welfare. Your comment implies that 94% of black voters are on welfare. Your comment implies that 71% of Hispanic voters are on welfare. 

This propaganda from the Republican rank and file on the internet that African Americans and Hispanic Americans are all on welfare is EXACTLY why more POC don't vote Republican. Who would want to join a political party that has such a low opinion of you? Newflash: a lot of people might just be voting against the racism and divisive exclusionary Southern Strategy in the Republican party and recognizing that the Republican party disdains and mocks them."
you can not comment about blacks and its bs.they do more crime than other races but if you say this then the libs call you a racists

"Why just any Asian?  Why not the specific race and subgroup of the original Hellboy whatever that was? In fact, why not just get rid of the so-called Asian character?

I wouldn't object to an Asian American taking a former Caucasian role or any other role."
"I'm all for the death penalty for violent rapists, but what did Trump do? Groping in a public place? Punch him in the face like I teach my daughter to and let him know it's not allowed (if indeed it isn't - some of you girls are OK with it, you know). Don't spend your life anguishing over the injustice. Boys/men are pigs. If you're an adult woman and are surprised by this, I point you toward all of human history. Henry the VIII, JFK, Bill, and every rock star you can think of. Alpha males get away with more, because the tribe figures he's the most fit, and he should have more kids than the rest of us losers. This will make the tribe stronger. Not all Alphas are so worthy, of course, but broadly speaking....

"BLM rose up under Obama. Tell me how Obama had a great relationship with black Amartica.
BLM came from cities with black Democrat leaders. Tell me how the policies of those black Democrats helped their constituents.

"The early ""false morels"" have the solid stem that goes up inside the cap. I usually just break off the cap and discard the stems and then saute them in butter, garlic salt and black pepper like regular morels. My thinking is that really cooking them thoroughly possibly cooks off some of the poisons? There seems to be more popping when the false morels are frying suggesting that some kind of gas is being liberated. Have a friend who is desperately allergic to any mushrooms so we have to be very careful that servers in restaurants understand that. Some people are more sensitive to substances that others aren't affected by in the least ala the recent gluten, peanut, corn, milk etc allergies that seem to be proliferating. Luckily I have never been affected by ingesting any mushrooms so far but wouldn't advise anyone to ingest mushrooms that you aren't absolutely certain of. Morels are so scrumptious that I prefer eating them straight up and not mixed into any dish. Side dish delicious."

"Underwhelmed?  Parker's experience is a common response that many women use: ""stashed the experiences so deeply in my psyche’s junk folder"" -- it felt wrong, so it was buried to avoid confrontation.  Confrontational women, not too long ago, would have found themselves on the floor -- maybe with a black eye to boot -- for talking back to their spouse.  The essence of that attitude is still alive and well -- as many don't see their behavior as something they ""should not engage in"" nor do they consider it ""abhorrent behavior""."

The black character of Mohammad, the Islam resolve to eliminate infidels to meet the ultimate goal of Islaminazation of the world, and the preference of Shira law, are unmentioned nitty-gritty of great contradictory significance.  

Adventism is neo-Judaism already, so those cousins have already married, without reproach.  

Adventist/Islam amalgamation isn't on the horizon. What looks good on paper has a different view in minds. Behavior is enacted there. An infinitely sized tent doesn't have enough room to happily accommodate the diverse parties.

But your article is instructive to a novice, me, on Islam. Thank you."

"I think that the writer had expectations that could never be satisfied in a law firm. I went through the process a number of years ago and was astounded to be the only one who wanted to take time off on the High Holidays not long after my articling year began. This was not a giant firm, but rather a medium one that specialized in one area of law. There was not one other Jewish person there, whether lawyer, student or support staff. My family name had been Anglicized by immigration authorities generations before. The writer seemed to want the work and the status and to keep on with her sport,  but not what went along with it, like wearing a suit every day. Every workplace has its norms, like the suit. It is the openness to people from other backgrounds and cultures that has to change. Not easy when legal culture replicates itself with each new crop of lawyers with shared schools, social norms and more. Being black is not the only way not to fit in. Old school WASP culture limits this."

"I doubt very much people here are justifying the discrimination or killing of any black person by any means. I think the biggest arguing point is everyone's version of history. In your comment alone there are a couple of ""facts"" you obviously 100% believe in, which I disagree with. I blame politics and the school system for this. It is in the interest of politicians that a certain narrative is told and believed. Schools should create a safe and neural environment to teach your history, my history and then stimulate a debate for the two to meet somewhere. There is a big debate about ""indigenous land"" - if your open to honest debate, do some research on what year Van Riebeeck arrived and when the they came across the first black person (Xhosa). Read about tribal areas and tribal wars. I can go on about more, but space is limited and not everyone is open for constructive debate."
"GBA:  If Charles is about our age (70-75) and lived his life as a black man in America, he has experienced a very, very different America than did you and I.  Would it do you any harm to acknowledge that.  He, I'm sure, could tell you anecdotes of institutional discrimination and personal discrimination and racial insults he experienced over his life.  Would it do you any harm to muster just a little empathy for him.  From all I gather, he's a very bright, competent man who succeeded in life through a) his talents, b) his perserverence and c) his ability to, somehow, tolerate the mistreatment he received and ""bounce back"".  Today, I think his attitude reflects all those experiences he's had...just as our lives reflect our experiences.  Does he sound angry? Yes, indeed, he does.  I don't know about you, but, I'm guessing if I had received the treatment Mr. Dalton has received because he's Black over his lifetime, I'd be on very angry man myself.

"Without actually acknowledging the foundation on which laws are based; is racism the reason people use the American flag as crutch? In order to answer my own question, I believe politicians can't handle the truth. Are you Black or African American?  Administrative action questions used on governmental forms describes whitewash with a hidden agenda to target an entire ethnic group. Although the U.S. Constitution relays our rights and privileges as American Citizens; the U.S. Constitution was implemented during  a period where colors lingo were mostly used by Supremacists.

Anyone...yes, anyone who has the money and wants one, can get a semiautomatic rifle with a large capacity magazine.  There are millions in private hands and readily available.  We've seen the results and, I fear, will continue to see more.  I would suggest we need to focus on the causes of the violence.  Social issues, economic issues, mental health issues, the huge failure of our criminal justice system, alcoholism and drug abuse, ...specifically on the increasing animosity between the Black community and police agencies.  If we don't effect some significant changes we're going to see increasing violence in a heinous cycle of destruction....each incident, each shooting, each incident of violence makes the next one that more likely........"
"Putin and the Russians don't need a map. They know what they want and how to achieve it. The key to Crimea is that it is where the main body of the Black Sea Fleet is stationed. For decades, foreign powers have tried to eliminate the Black Sea Fleet. Crimea is where the British and French fought the Russians in the Crimean war from 1853 to 1856.

For years, the Ukrainian government have threatened to cancel the lease at Sevastopol and have the Black Sea Fleet evicted unless they got more money. The threat is to offer it to the West as a NATO naval base.

When the Ukrainian government was overthrown in 2014, the new government made a mistake of announcing that Russian military forces would have to leave Crimea. The Russians have always had an elite force of around 20,000 soldiers including the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. It was likely these soldiers who suddenly and quickly seized power in Crimea in a well planned exercise."

"As a fan of the Broncos for 47 years, I will no longer support them. I will no longer watch you or buy your jerseys, hats, shoelaces, what have you. You players and coaches and the entire NFL MISSED THE POINT! To protest about police brutality towards blacks in America could be a valid debate. HOWEVER, to kneel during the National Anthem, which has NOTHING to do with police brutality and EVERYTHING to do with the fallen soldiers of this country and the AMERICAN FLAG, is a blatant disrespect to those soldiers, their families (who have a flag folded and given to them by the Honor Guard), the USA, but also to the FANS and millions of everyday AMERICANS who honor these things. You used the wrong format for your protest. You brought politics into a sport. Our one chance to get away from the political mess. You used your platform to trash Trump. I agree with him; you SOB's should be fired. No racism there. ALL of you should be fired. Starting with Goodell. You disgraced this country."
"In another context, you would scream “racist!” if someone called Brown or Martin “boy.” Yet you refer to them as children.

They are two different individuals, involved in two very different encounters. I have no sympathy for Brown. Clearly, he didn’t listen to “the Talk” black parents supposedly give their kids.

On the other hand, both Martin and Neighborhood Watch shooter George Zimmerman were, in separate ways, victims of our decaying social order. One of the most revealing comments in the 9-1-1 tape was when Martin said, “These a—holes always get away.”

Note that Zimmerman did not say, “These n-----s always get away.” He was frustrated with rampant crime in his neighborhood. When people feel unsafe in their own homes, they arm themselves and take matters into their own hands."

Why did Trump make a sexist comment about the congresswoman who overheard his call to Le David's widow and why is he calling Le David Johnson's widow and every other woman he comes in contact with a liar?

Omari has long represented the black community as an outspoken activist and Seattle School Board candidate. He earned notoriety when he clobbered Mayor Paul Schell with a bullhorn, something I think Omari deserves a gold medal for.

"Here is my celebratory observation.

Yes, many Canadians are racist against black Folks.

But many are not.

And so, as the saying goes, you can see the glass half empty or half full.

But I would say that the single greatest piece of evidence that Canada is doing pretty well in this area is that Canadians, by and large, do not stereotype black folks here, instead we recognize diversity among black folks here.

And so, on the one hand, we recognize the studious and hard-working black students, be they in Windsor or Halifax, and the everyday black families in Montreal and Laval and Brampton and Edmonton, and the black folks who have risen to fame, from senators to singers, from Members of Parliament to doctors, and so on.

But in recognizing diversity here, do we not also recognize the infamous, the maladaptive, the unhelpful, as in the group ""Black Lives Matter, Toronto Chapter"" or U. of T.'s' ""Black Liberation Collective""?

Seeing the wide diversity is a good sign. There is hope."

"Yeah right! Sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-black attitudes in the military have been prevalent for decades, often encouraged and promoted by the upper rank officers.  It's always ""we'll take care of it"" excuse AFTER one scandal or another happens but it always is swept under the rug (well, they can afford a gigantic rug with the budget they have).

"That is just as incorrect as saying the US Senate was intended to dehumanize black slaves.

Both the Electoral  College and the US Senate were intended to protect small states (initially mostly in the relatively slave-free North) from domination by the more populated or largely unsettled states (of initially the mid-Atlantic and South).

The 3/5 rule was a result of the enslaved status of blacks.... not a cause if that enslavement.

Ironically, in the Constitutional Convention, it was the slave masters of the southern states that wanted slaves counted as full persons vrs the northern state representatives who wanted slaves counted not at all because they were not free men eligible to actually vote.

Slavery was a terrible practice. But it had nothing to do with the creation of an Electoral College."

"Hi DC,

Regarding this quote:  “Oregon’s long flirtation with exclusion laws had finally ended. But while the exclusion laws were rarely enforced, the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.” p. 171  What evidence does Nokes present that ""... the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.”  Opinion is fine but opinion as fact is disingenuous.

I think the Mims Memorial is a great idea and a great addition to Eugene.  If Eugene was smart, the city would develop a self guided walking tour that is sort of like a scavenger hunt where the strollers/walkers move from site to site.

"I used to favor big magnums but got bored. Haven't hunted since 78. Then I decided recently to try black powder muzzle-loaders. Bought a 58cal Kodiak Express double rifle.
120 gr of powder, with a 270 grain lead ball makes it a good brush gun for medium game. 200 gr powder, with 570 gr lead bullet is without a doubt more than enough for a brown, at close range.
They hunt Cape buffalo with these, but use a 600 gr FMJ bullet. Traveling slightly faster than the speed of sound, those big bullets have both penetrating power, and high sectional density.
I don't hunt critters anymore, but it is a fun rifle to shoot. Two barrels give you back-up if a brown comes after you, but reload time is so slow, that it makes you hesitate, until you're really certain that you are in danger.
At the Rabbet Creek range, full loads sounded like cannon, plowed up the berm, smoke filled the shooting area. Bought a stock pad after that experience. Even small ladies would be comfortable with 120/270 light loads."

"This doctor's frustration is understandable, but there are so many wars going on in the world at the moment ... so many in the Middle East and parts of Africa.  No matter how many times other nations respond, the wars continue, and the flood of refugees grows every year.

As Jeffrey Simpson once commented, this war is a nasty modern manifestation of an old fight between Sunnis and Shiites, and between different schools of Sunni Islam.

"Chuck, I still dig in Washington and we get black shelled clams all the time. They are usually older larger clams and are called ""mossbacks"" locally.  They are usually found on the beaches that don't get dug as often due to where they are located and where fish and game decides to open. The beaches that are open the most and get dug hard have the least mossbacks.  We harvest 2.5 to 3 million clams per year here between the Columbia River and Moclips. That's roughly 60 to 70 miles of beach.  On weekend digs in the spring, we get over 1,000 people per mile of beach. So unless a beach is mostly closed during the year, most clams don't live long enough to turn black shelled.  But I just dug last week in the Moclips area and got a limit of all black shelled clams.

If you don't know the numbers, you should not be criticizing. 3 Black people over what time constituting how many positions? How many qualified candidates were considered?  Were the appointees that were picked qualified for the job.  Was there even any blacks in the running each time?  Can you answer all these questions? Otherwise your statement means nothing."

I wish all 27 of you and your families a very Happy  Hanukkah and the best for Ramadan for 2017.  I hope you will take this advice for 2017. Post on here regarding the topic and get away from the personal attacks on people from Toronto, Jewish people, Muslims, Gays, Africans and the poor  . It gets you nowhere. Absolutely nowhere. If that is all you have to say, or type, then its not worth the wear on your fingers.

Oh, and by the way...

I had at least 6 responses to your demented ramblings.
You deleted them all.
Because they were true.
And they embarrassed you.

"Actually I think the logic of BLM is quite obvious and compelling.  If you were to fill in what is implied in the shorter slogan, it would go something like this: All lives should matter, but historically in the United State Black Lives have mattered less (See slavery, Jim Crow, etc.), therefore we need to proclaim that Black Lives Do Matter also.  BLM does not at all claim that one race has privilege over another, but that all races should have the same privileges and rights that currently not all do."
"Why is it that when a group of people who are right of center want to practice free speech, we need police with riot gear to protect their free speech? 

Apparently the people on the left who were protesting this free speech were clad in black? They probably thought they were fighting against fascism ironically by using fascist tactics as they've done on many college campuses - especially at Berkeley."

"Give me a break..........Trump the protector of racists.

Did you not hear and ready what he said on the day of the tragic event and his subsequent comments.

Where was your editorial criticizing Obama and the other democratic leaders who applauded and hosts racists groups like Black Lives Matter and the ultra far left who won't tolerate free speech on campuses if the views don't support their own narrow approach.  No comment because you hypocrites!!

Get a grip on life.   No one supports racists from the left or the right.

Condemn them both."
"When you use the N word, you’re ignoring the pain and the racist history of this country”

How can the article infer that the Black Community is the main target for the N word, when in reality, they use that word within their own community perhaps as much as any others?  And why is that acceptable?

""Radical patience — that’s what most POCs have to tap into when we have to explain why certain racist behaviors, attitudes and practices are, well, racist.""

So if Certain racist behaviors are not acceptable, then by the context of the word ""Certain"", there must be some racial behaviors that are acceptable. Anybody care to list those please?

""there are soldiers who are waging war with stories, rhetoric, peaceful protest and radial patience.""

Generally speaking, soldiers are used after politics have failed, and patience has run out, and a peaceful resolve has all but vanished.  After seeing the majority of protests (AKA riots) around the country, is any of this starting to ring a bell?"
"It's not my ""logic""...it's historical FACT.  First black, COURT ORDERED, in 1655, as a slave was John Casor who had left the indenture of Anthony Johnson and going to work for a neighbor telling him his indenture had ended.  The Court, after finding for the neighbor, reversed itself, and awarded Casor to life as a slave to Johnson.  Johnson, himself, was a black Angolan who had been captured by a neighboring tribe, sold to Arab slave traders and ended up in Virginia.  After gaining HIS freedom, he became rather well to do, and have several ""indentured"" individuals working his farm.  but Casor was the 1st black ""slave"" documented by court action.  So, Johnson, a black former ""indentured"" individual took possession of John Casor for life, another black, as a slave.  Why is it I know more about your history than do you?  Perhaps you really DO need to do some research, other than the liberal brainwashing you have been subjected to!  You denegrate the accomplishments of your own people. Sad"
"well said. blackface is definitely not okay in the inclusive society most good ppl are striving for today. most ppl want others in their community to behave respectfully

"Madison knew that the North would outnumber the South, despite there being more than half a million slaves in the South who were their economic vitality, but could not vote. His proposition for the Electoral College included the “three-fifths compromise,” where black people could be counted as three-fifths of a person, instead of a whole. This clause garnered the state 12 out of 91 electoral votes, more than a quarter of what a president needed to win.

“None of this is about slaves voting,” said Finkelman, who wrote a paper on the origins of the Electoral College for a symposium after Gore lost. “The debates are in part about political power and also the fundamental immorality of counting slaves for the purpose of giving political power to the master class.”

He said the Electoral College’s three-fifths clause enabled Thomas Jefferson, who owned more than a hundred slaves, to beat out in 1800 John Adams, who was opposed to slavery, since the South had a stronghold. PBS2"
Are black lives matter terrorist's when they take over a city and burn and loot. When they terrorize and threaten students who put up a Blue lives matter display tear it down and physically enforce their views. Are they terrorists? If a bunch of ranchers being crushed by federal officials take over a building out in the boonies and don't burn and loot are terrorists should not black lives matter who do burn and loot be classified as terrorists. If those farmers and ranchers were all black would they be called terrorist's.
"I can tell you something all of those countries share, other than not recognizing the right of self defense. A largely homogenous population. You think blacks are a minority here? You think Hispanics are a minority here? No, the problem isn't rooted in firearm ownership by this population, it is an intentional Balkinization of the population via identity politics that has pitted us neighbor against neighbor. This collectivist strategy is as old as time and is the foundation for the fall of empires. Every collectivist government that has risen and fallen has used the same playbook. Demonize your opponent, divide the populous, overpower the system. Identify a ""common enemy"" for the society to battle, if you can't find one, invent one . . . maybe ""gun violence"", or ""assault weapons"", or gun law ""loopholes"". Sound familiar? Every dictatorial government has used these tactics, the party of Democrats is simply the latest, but they won't be the last . . ."

Now maybe Congress can work together on a bipartisan effort to fix ACA instead of repealing and replacing.  And get rid of Mitch Mcconnell.  He's worked to quash every initiative that Obama promoted the day  Obama became President...even refused to considered Obama's pick for SC vacancy.  Was it because he was black or a had Muslim name?  And thank the 3 repub who used common sense and voted against the repeal.
"I an see the basis for your reactions, but it certainly lacks any appreciation for the actual situation in which these people find themselves.  We are talking about an impoverished, barely developing African country that is torn apart by civil unrest and outright war.  Each day brings a distinct possibility of death.  It is near impossible for us to actually grasp the intensity of such a life, but if one really does believe in Jesus Christ, each of us can make a leap in understanding granted by Him.  It seems you have not yet grasped that essential part of being Christian, Rompecorazones.  Perhaps a lengthy period of prayer and reflection will awaken the deep Charity that lies beneath the harshness of initial reactions."
"Helen Zille I simply admire your wisdom, experience and insight.  You are truly a relevant leader.  Such a pity that Musi cant be infused with these qualities and instead hinges on the importance of being seen as a ""Black man, first and foremost"".  Personally, this indicates a racial tone and the fact that his perspective is superficial...he needs, as a leader to get to the ""core of an issue"" and that requires the ability to move down the layers of a multidimensional and faceted being or issue. It is here that you often find commonality that has the purpose of cohesion...he is an essence, he is a being, he is a man, he is a South African, he is a DA leader, he is black!  If only he had operated from this basis, had the experience and foresight you display in your article....today, with the Gupta leaks confirming your understanding of the political status quo..he would be viewed as a relevant and balance leader, with vision. The tittle belongs to you! Take him under your wing...please!"
"Oh my, another walking cliche.  Yes, I heard the chant to kill police - it was reported - not on your biased networks of course - their racism of low expectations on black people wins out.  Yes, it was peaceful until 11 people were shot. Are you that much a cliche?  Pearl Harbor was peaceful until just after 7:00 on December 7, 1941 - so what?  It was pretty ugly after that if you can read history."
"Nowadays, universities exist to teach students how to think AND what to think.  A more appropriate label would be ""Liberal Indoctrination Centers"" as Political Correctness is the core curriculum (as we see in this case).  And black privilege is very evident in UO athletics, is it not?  Now sit back and watch the PC hate and racist cards get played by the ""tolerant"" left."
"It is appalling to me that so many voters were so proud that we finally had our first black president. Then HRC whined at a rally that ""don't you want to see the first woman president?"" Race & gender should have absolutely NO influence on who gets our vote. Competence of the candidate should guide our fingers at the voting booth.
If we had a choice of a black like Ben Carson, or a woman like Carly Fiorina, neither of whom attempted to trade on their race or gender, but on their personal accomplishments and their voiced plan for their governments -that would have been a reasonable choice.
In our video game dominated society, the packaging of fantasies has replaced real life, for far too many Americans. The people who do focus on the realities of life are far more apt to become part of the 1%."
"I might agree that some people have overdone bringing in relatives.  However, it is not by having anchor babies...which this law is not actually addressing.   The largest number of anchor babies are Chinese.  Thriving business in parts of Ca. and it is the more affluent among the Chinese who do this.

Nonetheless, the goal is to reduce immigrants in general (something that might be based on xenophobia), and to greatly reduce the numbers of immigrants of color.   I imagine there is some reality to the idea that the countries of color are more wedded to extended family concepts than North Europeans have traditionally been.  And clearly there are more people who will have to learn English while they are toiling in American fields and hotel kitchens coming from countries that both have greater poverty and greater negative stereotypes attached to them."
"For the next four years it will be comatose, but it will regain consciousness and will be passed in time.  Face it, the religious nuts are dying out.  Most young folks today think gay people should have the same rights as anyone else.  As more peop,e openly  declare themselves as nones, agnostics and atheists, they become more angry about the right to discriminate against other Americans using the name of religion.  Denying any person access to public goods or services is evil, even when done from supposedly ""religious"" reasons.  Remember, it wasn't all that long ago Catholics were discriminated against for religious reasons and these supposed ""religious freedom"" laws could bring those days back.  Be careful what you wish for, as these things can easily bite you in the butt."
Well said. The far-left fascists will shout out anyone who they disagree with.  They even shouted down a progressive when she was debating a black woman.  Sad.
"The issue is governance.  Liberals want a free hand to reward party loyalists, and to mine opportunities for back-door political funding via traditional Liberal Party contractual king-making.  
One need only look at Infrastructure Ontario for a living example of black-hole dynamics operating at the epicentre of the huge capital spending flows overseen by government.  The Liberal government appoints party loyalists who in turn employ corrupt operators like Vas Georgiou to do the government's dirty work without directly staining government ministers when the labyrinth of corrupt dealings is eventually exposed.
The Infrastructure Bank proposed by Morneau is the civilized world's version of the 10% kickback men who direct financial dealings in corrupt third world countries.  It is the governance set-up that tells us this is so."
"See comments below re: Jorge Borjas and Adam Davidson.  Note, too, that in Feb. 2014, Aaron Blake of WaPo stated: ""The head of the Heritage Foundation's political arm said Monday that the comprehensive immigration bill passed in the Senate last year is the result of ""corporate cronyism"" and blamed another group that often aligns with Republicans, the Chamber of Commerce.""  The Chamber of Commerce, mainly Republican, is a main player in corporate cronyism.  

Opposed to corporate cronyism --- and to illegal immigration --- is Cornell University labor economist Vernon Briggs, Jr., who, in his briefing to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights regarding ""The Impact of Illegal Immigration on the Wages and Employment Opportunities of Black Workers,"" stated that ""no issue has negatively-affected the economic well-being of African Americans more‖ than immigration. * * *  Dr. Briggs viewed such losses as a denial of basic civil rights and economic opportunity.""

"There is only one man in Washington who has the .....backbone to speak the truth. The fascist Antifa and Racist Black lives mater came ready to fight and that's what they did. Supporting history and noble men whether you agree with them or not does not make someone (as the current marxist lies would infer) a racist. They had the right to peacefully do that and they did, BLM and Antifa do not have the right to beat people up and shout them down, it is they who have blood on their hands as much as the driver. Trump support grows with the people with every swing he takes at these idiots who call themselves reporters but who are in reality just the new face of Pravda"

"No James,
Let me educate you. I'll speak plainly so you and your minions can understand.
What the Vostok cores taught us is that the increases in c02 consistently lag behind temperature increases by about 800 years.
This proves increased levels of c02 do not cause warming if it doesn't happen until after the warming.
They also learned that 325,000 years ago (long before the great scientists al sharpton and al gore were born) long before black lives matter appeared on the earth, the global temperatures and c02 levels were higher than they are today
Case closed.
NEXT."
"That is a ridiculous comment. We both know that almost without exception the 4,000 people lynched in the South were black."
"Sadly I can only endorse what Carsten notes. Saddest of all is that it has to be a race issue but that is what you get when you are part of, or go along with an unprincipaled and immoral system - the a preference  based on skin colour. Apartheid was just as immoral and one would think the new SA would have learnt from that. My whine; we also tender for work but have to give at least 10% or 20% advantage to ""black"" companies as well as deal with the widespread corruption and incompetence in state entities, and of the whole system including the rating of companies BEE status. ""Private"" developments are also hungry for BEE points and often have a preference for ""black"" companies.

But we have an ironic chuckle and try and rationalise the whole rotten system as the cost of doing business in SA, just as I imagine we might rationalise having to pay bribes in say, Zimbabwe or Nigeria. It is all legalised corruption. Rather focus on honesty and equality than skin colour."

"Agreed, but why do you want police to perpetuate a retribution towards a group that is already upset at police?

Police treat gays and blacks poorly, this is historically documented. So gays and blacks protest by excluding them in the parade and send the message, they're tired of being treated poorly.  So now you want police to react to that ""stop treating us poorly message"", by further treating them poorly.

You logic is obtuse to say the least."
"Trudeau and the Liberals for as an yet unknown reason desperately want a seat on the U.N.'s Security Council. To that end they have done everything possible to gain the attention of the U.N. with suitable gestures and of course large sums of money to be spread around on various U.N. sanctioned causes.  The mission to Mali or some other African country is one of those gestures. There is a very real likelihood that some of our troops will either be injured or die, as this will be peacekeeping. When the unfortunate does happen, I hope that enough people will remind Trudeau of the price that was paid in order to get  the dubious seat on a U.N. Council."
"And you  trust Obama and his rendition of false history for your facts. His entire criminal justice commission was for only one purpose. Let thousands of black felons out of prison based on presidential lies about ""targeted"" races. Even the DOJ can't fine enough lies to cover for Obama and his racism.  So your solution is to only allow arrests of criminal based on their percentage in the population instead of the crimes they commit? Hope you are never allowed  to sit a jury."
"What? This is sob story central?
Why is it that every black pro-football-wanna-be player has a sad story to tell?
Without a doubt, there is some sorta heartbreak associated with a black player being drafted or trying to make a team.
Geez. It becomes a worn out welcome mat.
Can't you report a story in a positive light instead of constantly reminding readers how so and so and such and such overcame adversity just to land at the footstep of stardom?
As for me, this constant detailing of a player's hardship is worn thin.
Maybe they should try working a demeaning, demoralizing job.
There are plenty of hardworking people who view the NFL as an escape from life's daily travails.

"According to your logic, anyone with an agenda can claim affinity with the Black movement.  I disagree."
"I know you people are feeling empowered these days and I actually understand...but perhaps you should come to terms with the reality that you're still in the minority.

"Sarah, this is a remarkably good piece of writing. If it is coming back, you have perfectly captured an extremely compelling response: we cannot deny, this time, where this kind of thing is heading. Thanks to the scrupulous fidelity to ensuring the full story was told by your grandparents and their generation, willful blindness is bad faith. Not a one of us - not Muslims, not African Americans, not gays, not Jews... not a one of us should remain unprotected by those of us who have taken the obligation to the truth and to learning the lessons of history seriously."
"""Nobody want to deny health coverage to those who need it.""

"Full face covering is probably common only in Saudi Arabia (been there, seen that). As for being taken seriously, how many innocent people do you think have been executed in the US, in hte last 20 years? They usually tend to be black and poor. Because their court appointed defenders are not interested in their defense. And their prosecutor knows a successful conviction helps his political career.

Women are not equal anywhere, except perhaps Scandinavia. A woman cannot become the President of the USA, even though they form 51 percent of the population. The same is true of Canada. 

25 percent of the children in Canada and 42 percent in the US are born to single mothers. That is the worst thing a man can do to a woman - impregnate her and leave. A lack of free daycare ensures that these women don't progress in their careers. 

So instead of all this pain about Muslim women, perhaps it is time to focus on the status of women here."
"United in their concern about policies of detention and incarceration that disproportionately affect their communities, Hispanic and black [sic] theologians gathered for a rare joint meeting June 4-7 in Albuquerque.

Similarly, “The abundance of their joy and their profound poverty overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part” (2 Corinthians 8:2).  “I will sing praise to my God while I live’ (Psalm 146:2), i.e. while I face death with composure and holy hope in the LORD.  “But I say to you, love your enemies . . . so be perfect, just as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matthew 5:44 and 48)."

"There is no inconsistency.  I don't celebrate laws or this law, I support it.  It is wrong to legislate morality because it ends up with greater injustice.  Adultery is a serious wrong and it should not be a crime.  Idolatry is the most serious sin a person can commit but it should not be a crime in the U.S.  

We don't prohibit murder, theft, discrimination against blacks and women as a matter of morality but of public equality for all citizens which enables the public peace to be kept more readily.  We don't criminalize adultery because it would not cure the problem any more than illegalizing abortion has lessened abortion rates in any countries where it is illegal - it has in fact given these countries higher rates of abortion in almost every case.

There is a reason to have governmental laws to keep the peace and allow an even playing field for all citizens.  Churches have a higher criteria for morality as to what constitutes sin as this should be based on Gospel to gain salvation."

At the end of his life, Atwater realized his work creating these dog whistles had coarsened the public discourse and made racism among Republicans more hidden and yet simultaneously prevalent, and he repented of his folly. You are incorrect to now foist this myth onto the left."

Ian, with all due respect, please shut up. Take your little box of matches and burn your little black anarchists uniform. I'm a Democrat, a Progressive, a long time Bernie supporter, and you and I have zero in common. Put your hate aside and get to work-real work. What a bunch of crap."
"Sit. Stand. Be respectful or not. This isn't about free speech as you've suggested Mr. Dingman, but rather that of a disrespectful Prima Donna. I think the real story here is that Kaepernick actually thinks he lives in a ""....country that oppresses black people and people of color."" Nonsense. Please don't demean those that have actually sacrificed to ensure our rights, including your right to have this rubbish printed. Your favorite NFL team's QB has sacrificed nothing"
"But Conrad Black is paid plenty to speak to people in a positions and with backgrounds, that would suggest they are far, far more discriminating. But they aren't.

Many pay handsomely to listen to Bill Clinton, too.  

Go figure."
He's not from the inner city. He comes from an upper middle class family. Why would you mention inner city? Because he's black?
"It doesn't fit my FBI data:

"45% of college educated people voted for Trump
37% of those with postgraduate degrees voted for Trump

42% of women voters supported Trump
29% of Hispanics voted for Trump
8% of Blacks voted for Trump"
"What about the non violent folks stopped just because they are black or Native American on some silly made up excuse, there are plenty of videos online showing nonviolent folks getting beat or shot. There are very few repercussions for cops that do anything.
We have had AST personal shoot several people before much happened to them, one was the legless fellow at a pulloff, I think he was the second for that ""law enforcement "" person. Another was the second victim of a female AST, shoot a native in Delta that even the other cop there thought was uncalled for.
I think felons and perps of domestic violence should lose all guns, that way our cops will be safer on the next call, it's no wonder some are so scared. We do have plenty of good decent police why put them in danger?
Maybe black people run because they know the entire ""justice system"" is stacked against them and they don't want to be beat or killed like their friends have been."
"""Tar is a black mixture of hydrocarbons and free carbon[1] obtained from a wide variety of organic materials through destructive distillation."" 

There is no tar in the Canadian oil sands."
"Conservatives need to stop talking about the Rich. O'Leary only talks about money, profit, and return on investment. This has little to do with good government.

Conservatives, if they want to carve out a place for themselves on the political landscape, need to outline how they'd help the poor, the weak, and the elderly. How they'd help children, women, people of colour, immigrants & refugees, and First Nations.

We already know Conservatives want to help Bay Street. We know they want to help Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Big Business. It's the Little People who vote and who need convincing. Harper claimed to be helping Little People, but he lost their trust after four years of Majority Government.

Our Constitution speaks of Peace, Order & Good Government. We need to hear answers as to how Conservatives will bring us those three things. So far, all I'm hearing is twaddle."
"Really?  I suggest that you take a poll of many of the inner city churches where the Bergolian concepts ARE alive.  Oh, sorry---this is where African Americans and Hispanics live----and apparently to you---they don't matter.  

Or, how about going to South America---Argentina, for example.  The Church is tilting to the Southern Hemisphere---where the poor live.  ""Go and tell John [the Baptist] what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walks, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them.  And blessed is anyone who takes no offense at me."" [Mt. 11:2-7, Lk 7:18-23]. 

Jesus always, ALWAYS favored the least and the marginalized in his society.  Francis is doing that in our world today.  If you take offense at that, I'm afraid that you would have taken offense at Jesus, too, in his mission."
You could care less whether or not a Black Lives Matter group lives here.  All you care about is stirring the racist pot.  Now crawl back under the rock from whence you came.
"In one sense, at least, the ANC regime substantially outperformed the Nats - the killing of predominantly Black people. Given the Nats' 67 Sharpeville ""scorecard"", the ANC's 115 (Esidimeni), 34 (Marikana) and the annual slaughter of some 7 000 children under five years of age - mainly rural and mainly Black - by forcing them to use contaminated water borders on latter-day genocide, and is way more ""impressive."" But, hey, the bigger picture means that the ANC saves R25-million or so every year by not having to pay child grants for dead kids."
"Give the black guy some credit.
The S&P 500 was 700 when Obama to office and 2,200 when Obama left office."
"Hi, Robin.  ""It is cheap and tacky to have entertainers stand-in for historians, academics, native elders...""  In this case, maybe so. (By the way, their ""records"" being myths and oral ""history"", I'm not sure native elders have a lock on ""deep historical knowledge"" over ""thousands of years."" But I digress...)

What I think you REALLY find objectionable is history treated as DRAMA.  As STORIES.  If so, say so.  What I find objectionable is when a series is neither good dramatic fiction-as-fact nor just-the-facts documentary (the ho-hum talking-heads kind you refer to.)  

Is ""Black Robe"" (Bruce Beresford, 1991) good entertainment? Failed at the box office.  Is it good history?  No, said one FN activist; it villified Mohawks because its theme was native resistance to Europeans was evil.  (Maybe because Jesuits thought so?) One of the best cinematic bits we've got, not that we've got a lot.  Need TONS more.  English biased, FN biased, Quebecois biased, west-coast biased, Newfie biased..."
"The editor made a mistake.  It was in 1991 and Obama was only 30, not an important author and mistakes happen. It wasn't Obama who wrote that.   It was corrected and should have been end of story yet Breitbart and Snopes and The Donald chose to run with a story they KNEW to be false.    There is NO EXCUSE for Trump haranguing Obama during his Presidency, the first black President,  to ""show his papers"".  No excuse for Trump's bad behavior.  He is the one who appears to be completely corrupt - just like in this article.  He doesn't act like an innocent man.  Now the Donald should show his tax returns and be transparent with his business dealings in Russia and the Middle East and allow this investigation continue, unfettered.."
"Incredibly uniformed comment. Most people in Alberta (obviously can't speak for all of us) understand that the drop in oil prices had nothing to do with the NDP (or Canada for that matter), the issue is that we've now recovered from $27/barrel to $50/barrel, which is likely where we'll be for the next few years, and the NDP are still planning on running huge deficits. If you're at a stable income but are constantly in the red, then you have a spending problem. For all of the Conservative waste that occurred in the last decade or so at least they were in the black. Obviously they were helped by high oil prices but it's one thing to spend when you have extra money, it's another when it's pushing you further into the hole."
"So National Post is anti-Jewish? Do you realize National Post is owned by Jewish Family?
Mass Media stresses too much of the fact Obama is African, he's bi-racial or Mulatto.
These facts bother you comrade, you should be working for the thought Police!"
Obama has no racial bias.  Right wing racists hate Obama because he is black.  Funny how you right wingers blame the victim...
"This is just more PC nonesense. The last supervisor I had before I retired from the Dept. of Defense was a black man whose name was Robert E. Lee, he happened to be from South Carolina. Are they going to relieve him of his job as well?"
"I have lived in the upper Hillside in the same house since 1983, about a 1/4 mile from the Upper Huffman entrance to Chugach Park. Until about 2011, we rarely saw any bears in the yard and never brown bears. 

Since then, we have had an explosion of bears, both black and brown in the neighborhood and I have the pictures to prove it, including pictures of two grizzly cubs. Those bears are now full grown and I have great pictures of them as adults trying to climb up on my neighbor's deck after I chased them out of my yard. 

We are a pretty bear aware neighborhood but for whatever reason, the bears are here in much greater numbers than in the past and they are hanging out much closer than they ever have. The novelty has worn off a bit and we are now my much more cautious than we have ever been just because we seem them much more frequently. 

I don't think we need a hunt now but if the numbers keep increasing, the option will have to be on the table."
"So former Democrat President candidate John Edwards was misunderstood for his temptations and results thereof? Have an affair while his wife was fighting cancer, then have a child with the other woman and try even harder to hide the kid? He initially denied being the father. 

Where's the rationale in that - coming from a man who wanted the country to believe him as vice president or president? Edwards wanted the public to ignore his situation, since he was trying to hide it, but that eventually blew up in his face. 

Thank you for agreeing with my premise, but your second sentence fails miserably."
"I live in Wayne County where Detroit is located, the Democrats control all elected Offices and have for the last 50 years.  The last Republican to win a County post was a Black Republican Bill Lucas who was elected Sheriff during the Reagan years.  Black Republicans can get lots of Votes in Detroit and other black areas in the State"
"Even though it's exactly the same logic, apparently one is OK ('gender') and the other is not (race).  Witness the savagery unleashed on Rachel Dolezal for identifying as a black woman...."
"Gerald, really? We elected a black man (twice) to the Whitehouse. THAT brought out the racists. President Obama didn't make them racists, they already were. You need to stop blaming victims and give 'credit' where credit is due."
It's attitudes like the letter writer that are part of the problem (note... part). What's the big deal if a cop shoots a black criminal? I would hope that everyone would be concerned if the police gun down criminal suspects (or school cafeteria workers) before the courts have a chance to decide guilt and an appropriate punishment. Thomas seems to think that black criminals don't deserve that process.
"Please don't take this the wrong way but

I owe my kids more quality time
I owe myself
Now I owe assault victims too?

This is the tyranny of socialism. 
They make you believe you owe everyone.
I will focus on my family and leave the rest of you to wallow in it since you enjoy it so much.
By the time I pay my family debt the rest of the world should have their crap together enough to stand on their own 2 feet without asking me to hold them up"
That'll inspire the unemployed African Americans alright.  Gudanya bro.
"I've always wondered when you are considered a person of color, Mr. Kaepernic claims he is, President Obama claims he is and they are both 50% shaded so do they get the full 100% of allowable complaints. Sure he is starting something in his mind and likes the attention but is it because he was demoted to 2nd string or what? There are other ways to protest but to not show respect to the National Anthem and the country that has really been good to him and a family that raised him and all of the benefits that he and his friends have worked for and received is rather childish. If he feels that the black race is being discriminated against then maybe he should get out of football and get into police work and see what they have to go through and the fears they have too like normal people. Maybe he could look too at the number of black ball players that keep getting into trouble with drugs and shootings and try to do something about that, he certainly isn't leaving his nice safe environment."
"On the face of it, many of the organizations that seek to “ expand women's understanding of their available choices” are dominated by college-educated professionals whose screed involves exterminating the offspring of those they purport to help. Planned Parenthood is a perfect example of this dynamic, from its founder Margaret Sanger to today.

As a result they are all too often fonts of misinformation, engaging in predatory and duplicitous practices.

In particular they completely fail to advocate for increasing the size of the pie by actually creating opportunities for women to live full and rewarding lives and focus on reducing the number of slices of the existing pie by reducing the birth rates of minorities.

That was brought in the recent election to the losing candidate’s attention in an open letter by a group of prominent black church leaders."
Welll gee...He gets off then! Poor guy was just expressing his frustration over 200 years of Black slavery! Hmmm...is the fact that he is Black the reason why the RG initially did not ID him?
"The Dems had a net loss of 1,042 state and federal seats while your black messiah was in office.  Sorry but your post was totally idiotic.  Did you find it printed under a Starbucks latte cup?"

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game.

"What is way more offensive than this mural could possibly ever be is that awful Blaine Fontaine mural in Alberta that declares, in Fontaine's typical platitudinous Hallmark fashion, ""You are only confined by the walls you build yourself!""

"Thank you once again for the thoughtful take on this issue...it represents a clear consensus of the majority of Americans. Then the questions is, ""why do we allow cop-killer bullets, large remove able magazines and military style weapons?"" The why is related to the fear...seeing the black polic chief of one of the best polic forces in tears should say it all...but the killing of children didn't, the murder of police won't either.  We are governed by fear...that Obama is not one of us and he's coming for your guns seems to be a thread. So is this fear of a war going to start a war? Only if we continue to let a few rather strange leaders set the agenda."
"You neglected to answer my questions about the defense of marriage act, NAFTA, her putting blacks into prison for minor offenses and wanting to make black predators heel.

Let's not forget about that."
"I, too, appreciate civil discourse.  I read the articles you provided.  If the last article is correct, I will have to change my opinion on abuse. (The data source is at least partially from peoples perceptions which is suspect.  The data source of the ""stop and frisk"" is probably spot on.  The others seem to deal with shootings.)  The Chicago Tribune article specifically stated ""But it is true that a disproportionate amount of murders and violent crimes are committed by Black Americans"" which means the police are often in more dangerous situations.  I want to make sure I am not misunderstood.  I do NOT think any race is more likely to commit crimes because of their race.  I believe it is a by-product of the socio-economic conditions and any person in those conditions would be more likely to commit a crime.  I believe it is the conditions which need to be addressed more than race which is why I support economic zones, school choice, an expanded earned income credit, etc...."
"The racial divide is prevalent and always will be in this country. We encourage it with the likes of Black Lives Matter, Black Talent Awards, Black History Month, etc. Elections results are reported by race. Have you ever been to an inner city. Fact is Blacks strain the social service system. Sadly, these are facts folks, let's admit it."
The expectation of African American kids having a black president was that their lives/situation would improve. Unfortunately for the majority nothing much changed. For many others (Chicago for example) their situation became worse.
"The article mentions statues that were erected in 1890, so not sure why you're trying to change the narrative by suggesting otherwise?

I agree with the black mayor of Richmond's (Levar Stony's) compromise... keep the statues, but use them for education, not for glorification of a confederate past.

Unfortunately, a liberal mindset seems to think that removing statues somehow erases the sins of the past... somewhat like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand, if you ask me."
"The truth is that black men make up less than 7% of the population but account for over 50% of violent crime. If black men are being shot at a higher percentage than other groups (which FBI stats seem to refute) perhaps it's due to such a small population committing a disproportionate number of violent crime?  Blacks are killing one another by the hundreds in Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit,  Cleveland, etc but not a word of protest from any of the cowards in the NFL or Hollywood who are so concerned for poor black people."
"Dreyfus?

"Hmmm doesn't the ""nothing about us, without us"" allow the previous era of segregation.?  Don't include and therefore don't even need to acknowledge existence of, doesn't seem to be a great way to integrate populations. Since treating one group as marginal and second class (for example aboriginals in Canada, blacks in US) created so many of the current and historical injustices, why are so many marginalized groups now pushing to have that divide reinforced?  I suppose it might make sense if their culture now had the upper hand and wanted a tit for tat revenge however it doesn't seem to me that they do have the upper hand and that these increased divisions can only hurt the more marginalized in their communities even more than they are now."
because she's black & a tranny
The crucifixion and lynching of a UP professor with black make-up on her face was brought to you by Hillary Clinton and the Politically Correct armies that support her.

"Without denying our desperate need to--for the sake of our own survival--address the inextricably-linked issues of unsustainable human population growth, and criminally inequitable misappropriation of natural resources, it's nonetheless necessary to point out that environmental degradation due to human-engendered invasive species is an ongoing and deadly threat not only to other native species, but to ourselves.  And cats are among the worst species in that regard.

Having said that, your argument is merely an (unusually carefully-stated) example of the logical fallacy of deflection, and no more sensible than arguing that we should ignore cancer because heart disease kills far more people.  Or that those Texas klansmen who dragged a black gentleman behind their pickup until his HEAD popped off in 2008 shouldn't have been imprisoned because the Da'esh (""ISIS"") behead far more people.

This is in fact one of the cat-nutters' most frequently resorted-to fallacies."
"-These players represent the black community and they are tired of being mistreated by police and discriminated against.- Talib shot himself in the leg, not the police."
"And that has happened in New York state? Or maybe eliminating property taxes, income taxes and corporate taxes for ten years has generated a boom of business in the state? If the country did the same, only set as permanent policy, then we would see economic growth unlike this country has ever seen. These policies work and work well. Income disparity has grown much worse in the last 7 years due to democrat strangulation of business in this country. Also, unemployment among minorities, especially blacks and black teens has skyrocketed in the last 7 years. As many leaders in the minority community have pointed out, the democrats have done nothing to actually help them in any way. What do they say about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Mmmmmm."
"Perhaps you should check the statistics as they don't support the narrative. Young black men are involved with a significantly higher percentage of violent crimes so it stands to reason they might be targeted by police.  Black men are also significantly more prone to being killed by other black men, why isn't that part of the conversation?  Why aren't they upset about what is happening in Chicago?  Protesting because Trump made a benign statement??  Give me a break!  The Broncos and NFL players are anything, but concerned about young black men in America.  Most could not even tell you why they were kneeling.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics will tell you all you need to know.  As for the Broncos and the NFL, they have proven what I have always believed....they will do/say anything to protect their brand."

"Daniel Moynihan's report on the African American family was released in 1965. ""Out of wedlock"" births for this group were already at 25% and single-parent households had been rising gradually since 1880.  So these roots go back some time. Historically, African Americans have also lived in extended family structures with more frequency that other cultures, and single mothers tend to be connected in one way or another to those structures. There are other issues, of course--loads of them. 

I don't know what you mean by women becoming more like men. Men are not the standard. Human is the standard."

ZUMA care about black people and for development of SA but ramaphosa doesn't care about anyone.
It's sad that NOT doing something stupid is considered News!  Kaaepernick was spurred into making his insane protest by his black Muslim girlfriend - clearly to advance her extreme leftist ideology which puts anarchy above freedom.
"I agree with this comment almost entirely.  Yet it still does not explain why 8% of the black vote went to the unspeakable Trump. My guess is that like most voters who voted for ""improbable things"" and against their most probable candidate, Trump held out the promise of more interest and cap gains on $avings and equitie$. The same may apply to the approximately 40% of women who voted for the bizarre orange man, despite his gross and verifiable sexist comments. Money Trumped everything in some voting booths. Just breaking the vote down into colour and sex does not go nearly far enough. Break it down into money."
"I""m not a fan of Black - but can you imagine - you give up your citizenship but terrorist can keep theirs."
"Precedent Dotard's attacks on black athletes who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality and police brutality inadvertently prompted more awareness to the cause as more people began taking a knee.
Like, Meghan Linsey, a country singer who took a knee in protest at the Titans-Seahawks game earlier this week after performing the Star-Spangled Banner.
It was a bold move for a country singer to show solidarity with African-Americans who have endured injustices.
Since she took a knee, death threats poured in but she says she has no regrets, even though she received hate mail from ‘people' telling her she was anti-military and they hoped she would get cancer.
Yep.

Pride has capitulated to threats of direct action and in doing so have severely damaged their reputation as an inclusive organization. BLM have hijacked Pride for their own self-serving agenda. Also, it's not like there aren't black police officers in Toronto... you're embarrassing yourself, BLM's antics should not be rewarded. The event should be changed to the Pride by BLM - as it's clear they dictate who can and cannot attend and Pride goes along to get along."
"There was an article about the African-American man sitting behind Trump.  Apparently he makes an appearance at many of his rallies:  

""The radical fringe activist from Miami once belonged to a violent black supremacist religious cult and he runs a handful of amateur, unintelligible conspiracy websites. He has called Barack Obama “The Beast” and Hillary Clinton a Ku Klux Klan member. Oprah, he says, is the devil.
Most curiously, in the 1990s, he was charged, then acquitted, with conspiracy to commit two murders.""

They don't get to me because I grew up w/a racist, woman hater (married 5 x's) and a bigot.  I told him to his face (my dad) that he was all of those things and he denied just like these poor souls do.  It was laughable the last fight we had.  A young African American was in the news because she'd been cut on her face from forehead to chin and he said (matter.of.fact like): she probably deserved it.  That was the last time and I walked away from everyone in my family.  I stand in solidarity w/ all those who are the object of this kind of evil."
"Thanks Ambrose.  That's about 80% of the whole US illegal immigration discussion, or lack thereof.  11 million illegal Mexican immigrants made it to the US over the past 2-3 decades because the upper half of the US socioeconomic distribution was either unaffected by it - illegals aren't competing with college-educated professionals for work - or even benefitted from it - those who hired illegals as nannies, or who hired illegals to do construction or other ""grunt"" jobs.  I'd hate to be on bottom half of the US pecking order over the past few decades.

With well over 40 million legal Americans of Hispanic background, Vicente Fox's cries of ""racism"" are simply absurd."
"You missed my point:  Teams will tolerate mavericks, but only as long as they win.  How many of those non-winning QB's were mavericks making the same money as Kaep was making?  If Kaep ranked in the top 8 instead of the bottom 8, things would be different.  Look at Ray Rice, Adrian Petersen, etc.  The NFL will tolerate quite a bit of distraction if the player  (even a black player) is of premier quality."
"And then there are the hard realities that nobody wants to hear. RW Johnson pulls no punches in his analysis http://politicsweb.co.za/opinion/how-do-you-explain-your-own-role-in-all-this in which he describes the majority of our current political leaders as parasitic and the ANC as looters of state coffers for 23 years. How do build an economy on that - or anything else? Only liars and thieves can thrive in such an environment. So why are there still honest hard working people left in SA and why do they still pay their taxes? Maybe because they foolishly cling to a hope of nation building. One South African nation. Maybe it is because they believe there are a few black leaders in this country who are different. A few black men and women who have the right stuff. Black leaders that have integrity, that can see through BS and move beyond the divisions of the past. You Mr Jonas is one of them."

"It's ""Mr.""

Poverty fell during the 1990s because the economy was good, probably due to technology and the Internet bubble. When the economy went back down in the early 2000s, poverty increased and welfare was not there for people who had exceeded its five year limit. The welfare ""reform"" bill was an attack on poor people, a drastic cut in the safety net they depend on.

The crime bill greatly increased incarceration in this country and was devastating to blacks. They were not happy about it. Last I heard we led the world in the incarceration rate -- or maybe we're second behind China. You can look it up. The ""war on drugs"" was especially destructive. Putting huge number of people in jail does not solve social problems, is very expensive, and the country is now backing away from it.

Al Gore, like the Clintons, was a conservative southern Democrat, and a hawk. By the end of Clinton's term a lot of us were sick of all that, and still are. No sale."
"There will be some reluctance in some circles to accept Mr Singh as a leader of a Canadian political party.  It is a new thing, and there are always those who resist new things.  Mr. Singh could mitigate this by emphasizing Sikh CANADIAN and not a Canadian SIKH.  He already does this through his demeanour, his charisma, and his obvious comfort mingling outside the Sikh community.  He will broaden his base and vote potential by being Canadian first.  He will remain a minority candidate with pockets of electoral strength if he unduly focuses on his Sikhness.

"Absolutely. Today on the networks Kellyann was falling over herself with her ""interpretations""  of what Donald meant. What happened to actually saying what you mean and not having to have a surrogate spin your comments a few hours after you spew them.  The FOX new crew panel, Outnumbered,  were all trying to convince the audience:Trump was simply providing information to Americans. So once again the president elect took it upon himself to speak for the country.  When in history has a private citizen been given such privilege.

I remember thinking the Creature from the Black Lagoon was what was hidden in the swamp.  I now see the creature as a friendly member of society compared to Trump."
"Did you read the above link about Gorka?  Do you think it is okay for the Trump administration to associate with such a person?  

Moreover, there has been an outbreak of hate crimes and antisemitism since Trump's election.  This includes incidences of people being killed as happened in Kansas City, threats against Jewish community centers, vandalism of Jewish synagogues and the cemeteries, etc.  This all happened after the election and is directly connected to Trump.  Alt-reich bigots certainly feel okay to spread their hate now that Trump is POTUS in away they didn't while Obama was in charge.  

Finally, the Muslim Ban and indiscriminately rounding up Latinos and demanding the papers of dark skinned people do nothing to prevent terrorism or increase law and order.  These are acts of discrimination against minority populations."

"Contrast the views of a few Alaskan GOP ""Leadership"" with the opinions of the comments on this article and you can see why our country is in so much trouble. Ever since the voters in Alaska smote Joe Miller with the jaw bone of an ass the GOP leadership has worried that they have ""lost control"" of a minion.
Fully 51% of GOP voters DO NOT KNOW that the ACA they are using and "" Obama Care"" are one and the same. Trump says he loves the uneducated voter, this is why, it's so much easier to pull the wool over their eyes and give tax breaks to his donor's.
This vote failed for the exact reasons that the GOP has accused the ACA of for 7 years, done in secret, find out what is in it when it passes.
When the few ""leaders"" (not elected by the people in general) run the country their way that sounds like a dictatorship. That is even worse than the dread ""socialism"" we are told to fear.

"The Black Lives Matter movement is not to stir up hatred.    It is in response to injustice they experience living in our United States.  The reason the media focused on the remarks by the President was because we were shocked by his lack of clarity about the events in Charlottesville.    By saying twice ""by many sides"", he implies that nobody in particular was at fault.  Oh yeah, a liberal protester here, and a neo nazi there.....all the same.    No it was not."

"To be fair, Democrats play the race card every day, on every network, every single year. They have to. Their record of achievement with African-American voters - on poverty, on black-on-black crime, on education, on wages, on the unprecedented number of African-Americans on Food Stamps - is abysmal. As liberal black TV host Tavis Smiley said on HuffPost Live, “Sadly — and it pains me to say this — over the last decade, black folk, in the era of Obama, have lost ground in every major economic category.”


Anytime this record of non-accomplishment is raised, Democrats have a predictable response: the GOP blocked us. Their favorite line of late has been that “Obama inherited the Great Recession from George W. Bush.” This is known as The Bush Card, which is also used to explain ISIS, the growing debt and deficit, and more."

"Because black on black crime is the direct root of the police contacts and injuries.  Black shootings by the police are a symptom of black on black crime.  Gangs kill each other and sell drugs and other crimes, the police respond to those crimes as demanded by the community.  The police get no cooperation from the community and have to contact yet even more people to identify who is involved.  That contact infuriates those people and you get confrontation which leads to more injuries.  Is it not that straight forward, nah it has to be a bunch of cops who are racist."
"Hey Charles, sounds like some good advice, so, if you really care about all black lives and not just the extremely small amount killed by police, (usually due to their own decisions) why don't you use that 40 years of experience and go into the inner cities where bad choices are getting so many black lives killed daily and try and help? Or do you find it easier to just spew your racism here and bemoan the results of 50 years of dems ruling the inner cities? Do you really care about all black lives Charles?  Do you really want change? Or are you content being used and keeping up the racism? If you don't care about all lives then it's okay to continue with your hate, just please quit blaming others for the bad decisions you support that have failed so 
 many so miserably."
"Like all pro illegal immigrant orgs, the bishops refuse to say just how many illegal immigrants America should take in every year.

And the bishops also fail to mention that it used to be African Americans who held the jobs that illegal immigrants have taken.    This loss of employment has had a huge effect on Black culture in the U.S., and for the worse.    Nope, no mention of that in their bromides about the value of family.

What a coincidence that the majority of illegals are Catholic or come from a Catholic culture.   Not a coincidence really.   The bishops are just putting parochial issues over that of America's best interests, and quoting the bible to try to give it moral weight."
"Before you do that IDIOT and DISRESPECT thing, supposedly this is ALL for blacks killed by Police. THINK about the FACTS that ALL but ONE ( that officer sentenced to life in prison ), were killed while in the commission of yet ANOTHER FELONY, ALL RESISTED arrests, NONE HAD THEIR hands up, NONE NONE NONE, ONLY ONE had fewer that EIGHT prior FELONY CONVICTIONS, including the PUNK THUG in La. who was convicted of RAPING THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. Think of those FACTS."
"Yes, really. It's no secret that Hitler and the Nazis scapegoated Jews, created propaganda about Jews and capitalized on anti-Semitic sentiment that had existed for generations. Trump has taken the same road with ""illegals"", particularly Mexicans, whom he labeled criminals and ""rapists"". And in Trump's campaign, this ill-will extended to all people of color, including American citizens. Hello, he was endorsed by the KKK."
These shootings must come to an end. Police will continue to approach situations with heightened vigilance and twitching nerves if people continue acting like violent miscreants. Black lives matter will roar when a police officer shoots someone but it is silence of the lambs when these criminals act out in such a manner.
"You mean like when Ted Nugent threatened violence against Obama? Or when Palin put a cross-hair graphics over all Democratic campaign locations? How about the shootings of a doctor, in a black church, the Orlando massacre? etc.

Get real, the GOP and Trump's own rhetoric are far from blameless. In truth, until Trump, I've never seen our nation so much hatred, racism, and outright bigotry raising so much ugliness in dividing our country."

Today, it's all about ""What has my country done for me lately?""! Seems for these millionaire NFL players, and the NFL, which makes billions and which receives huge breaks and exceptions from our government that most corporations could only envy, apparently not enough!



Unlike Joe Louis, a man who an entire nation looked up as he took on Hitler's finest, a black man who endure much more racism that these NFL players will ever see, we won't have to worry about these NFL players being buried in Arlington Cemetery, they gave nothing even close to what Mr. Louis gave and believed when it came to America."

"""A lot of what is defined as apartheid crimes was actually a global fight against socialist expansion.""

This statement makes it clear that you condone and approve the criminal methods that were used by the apartheid regime against the majority of South Africans, who opposed the illegitimate rule of the Afrikaans-nationalist minority. You approve torture, murder, disappearances, poisonings... by claiming that these happened in defense against an evil threat. People like you will always find an excuse in order to justify their wrongdoings.

It's because of uncivilised and self-righteous bigots like you that South Africa makes so very little progress in processing and overcoming (in contrast to: ignoring and forgetting) it's past! 

You can thank the sell-out leaders of the ANC that you and your gang of criminals got away unharmed. You murderers deserve the Nuremburg Trials treatment! That's the only way to deal with ruthless torturers and mass murderers: capital punishment."

"Hi, John. I thought the immigrant was officially from Montenegro or someplace like that, although I also thought I'd read that he was Hispanic (Iberian?). The black guy from Juneau may have been innocent.

That was the basis for the Supreme Court's Furman v. Georgia decision, forty five years ago, getting everyone in the country off death row. An earlier decision that year, California v.

It was the Democratic Party who pushed for Jim Crow laws after reconstruction and who started the second KKK.  It was the Democratic Party who started the third KKK.  Hillary Clinton's mentor in the U.S. Senate was a Grand Wizard in the third KKK.

"‘Yes, they screwed up when they compromised on Reconstruction, over the vote on a presidential election, eased off and let the southern apologists institute Jim Crow.’ There was indeed Jim Crow and then came the Civil Rights Act in 1964.

I don't know what tax cuts are planned for ""the rich"" right now but the Bush tax cuts helped my small business and were tax cuts for ALL earners. Sure, the rich got cuts but they also got increases in capital gains and dividends. The middle class saw more of their paychecks. That is why Dems allowed them to be extended. Of course, he also spent too much and added to the deficit but we can't just tax that away by punishing success rather than creating value, not just reallocating resources."

Under Trump, expect inflation and massive price hikes across the board.

"Americans were generous in celebrating the election of the first (mostly) black POTUS.  Now that this failed social experiment is over, they have to deal with the new POTUS.  The extreme choice to be was a direct result of the extreme choice just on his way out. Obama left the new administration an awful mess.....both internationally and economically. Not to mention the fact that black Americans are angrier now than when Obama took office......shouldn't he have helped race relations instead of moving them backwards?"

This has become the left game plan, sell the celebrity President or PM, or go for the 'first Woman' for votes, always a catchy thing.

.
Except for the facts that they apparently weren't random and he didn't fit the usual definition of a ""mass shooter"". They were seemingly targeted for their ethnicity.

No, what we are witnessing is populism, period. Yes, its present American leader happens to be a narcissist, but that does not render the movement ""narcissistic populism.”

In all of these co-ed shelters there is very little supervision of behaviors. 
The systems that deal with the homeless are based on racism. When the Clinton crime bill and welfare destruction happened devastating the black inner city areas they then placed a large number of police in the area to arrest as many as possible, they do the same in these areas where the homeless are concentrated. Note the security guards downtown for the purpose of running off the homeless. The systems are not in place to help the homeless, they are there to manage the homeless who are the left over people they could not get or keep in the prisons."

You said that the USA would not exist without black and brown folks. And then you said it would be more civil like Canada. So you are suggesting that the black and Brown folks are why we are less civil than Canada. That just seems bizarre. And you also introduced the topics of race and slavery into a discussion about a Christmas parade. Weird.
"Actually you make a good point. If I were born Jewish, I would always be a Jew regardless of what religion or belief system I adopted or practiced. Some religions are synonymous with race or so they identify as such. But there are Christian Jews, Buddhist Jews and so on. People are persecuted for their religions daily, so they are NOT protected. Their right to choose and practice IS protected by law. While it is true that I can't change my (born) color as you say, I can change my sexuality on a dime if I desire. Until it is proven that people are born as an LGTB human being (with verifiable DNA or genetic science). Sexuality is simply a choice.Many folks have had gay experiences, especially in the 60's & 70's and it didn't make them gay, but many chose to be gay as a result of those experiences. So I maintain, sexuality is a personal self-view. That is the heart of the argument here. So being black and being gay are NOT the same thing. You feel they ARE and the law IS on your side."
"Pluto, god of the underworld, or Disney dog, all created by humans to influence other humans.  The claims of long term jobs after these short term, out-of-state workers and equipment dig, bury, and pollute the landscape will be proven as false as the true foreign market intent of the contents.  North Dakota will continue to borrow from their state-owned, socialist bank to fund the massive military police might to keep all of these unarmed, unarmored terrorists in line.  Arrest and torture some more women, old men, and children to try to scare off everyone who defend their land, waters, and human rights.  A black stain on law enforcement, county, state government, and a national government too cowardly to stop it.  Maximum protections for the Texas-based Oil Billionaire black snake as it thrashes across the lands and waters for maximum greed.  Greed from oil neither needed for wanted in a nation awash in it."
What a feeble attempt to reach beyond Robinson's typical black vote pandering.
"Again B/S. Most German soldiers fought for the motherland. The majority didn't care about exterminating Jews. Just because most southern soldiers didn't own slaves mean nothing. Official gov't policy of the south was that they were fighting to preserve slavery. Every southern soldier knew this, just as every German soldier knew that Nazi policy was the extermination of Jews.
 Tired of hearing about the tyranny the north was putting on the south. Read the writings of Jefferson Davis and he states the reason for session is to protect the Souths "" RIGHTS"" to treat black people as a commodity to be owned and traded and treated as an owner saw fit. Also without slaves the GNP of the south would be extremely lowered, since the large plantations would have to pay to have the agriculture crops worked. Since the souths Gnp was all most entirely agriculture it could not survive as a country without slaves. Your whole argument is revisionist history. Do a little reading"
"You got that wrong dude. Congress is full of senior citizens of all different races.

Hmn is this a good idea?"
"Yes, where was he when Black Lives matter was marching in the streets and screaming ""cops are pigs, fry them like bacon"", (or something like that). I heard crickets from the former President. How about the riots at Berkeley , when they rioted to protest a conservative speaker (to prevent her from speaking). Media was fine with that, and where was the former President? It seems like protests by one group seem to be ""OK"" (freedom of speech), while a conservative is not allowed to even speak. Are you ok with that?"
"Is Alaska and are Alaska Natives better off as part of the United States?  If the answer to that question is yes, then a statue honoring the man who made it possible seems fitting. And while Natives undoubtedly suffered from racial discrimination over the years, and in some instances still do, they have also benefitted from laws that recognize their rights (ANCSA) and programs enacted to meet their needs -- Native hospitals and investments in village schools, water and sewer systems.   Bennie Benson, a Native, designed the state flag. It should also be noted that the Alaska purchase was a small part of Seward's career which is distinguished by his lifelong efforts to eradicate the oppression of blacks (slavery) and his major role in preserving the nation during the Civil War.  On balance, I think he deserves a statute. But if denied, the next time I visit Alaska I can travel to Seward on July 4."
"At some point rationality is less important than gut feelings, and in my gut, I feel as I did in the 60's when America murdered so many of the left and delighted in electing Nixon twice. Electing Nixon may  have been through fair elections, but it stopped being my America, and started being rule by the anti-union 1%.
This is Putin's win. He will soon be able to invade Ukraine.
It is Netanyahu's win, he and his followers are already being quoted as saying the idea of a Palestinian State is dead.
This is a win for those who hate Roe V. Wade, and women's reproductive rights, or gay rights. It was won by shutting down American government, hating the black man in office for seven years, and making sure poor Americans didn't have jobs or health care. 

So those who delight in this election...a compassionless gloating crew...enjoy your time in the sun. We who hate Trump and how he won are frightened of you, and many of us would move out of the country if we could.

"Why are you so bothered by black wealth ? The way Afrikaners speak as if they do not give each other tenders perplexes me honestly.

Your assumption is always that it must have been stolen."

AfriForum has every right to protest imo, just like the Fallists have every right. It’s about how you go about it. Having said that, if Black Monday want to gain the support and sympathy of the nation, they cannot allow the old guard to display the symbols of the past. It will sink them."

"In 2014, median household income was reported as $53,657—statistically the same as it was in 2013. The same stagnation held when it came to the poverty rate, with about 14.9 percent of Americans, or almost 47 million people, falling below the poverty threshold of about $24,000 for the year.

The news was, of course, worse for minorities and women. The rate of poverty among blacks and Hispanics was well over 20 percent. Women, too, remained more likely to struggle to make ends meet, especially elderly women, whose poverty rate was nearly double that of men in the 75 and older age group. And though more women than ever are participating in the workforce, with 61 percent of women employed full time in 2014, their earnings remained about 79 percent of their male colleagues.

None of them were killed by Trump voters or police officers as near as we can tell.  Do their lives still matter?

This isn't a real estate deal to acquire a plot of land, or get a zoning variance.  

This is about international relations, world order, and long term trade, financial, military alliance, environmental, and diplomatic relations.

The Africans, Middle Easterners, Latins/Hispanics and Asians in the assembly all sit there looking at Trump as a categorical racist.  

Eastern Europeans sit there looking at Trump as a guy who is going to throw them under the Russain bus eventually.

"I agree with the broad thrust of the very important argument that is being made here. State sponsors of terrorism ought to be held accountable - that after all, is what the Bush Doctrine is all about.

It's necessary and urgent to put Pakistan in particular on the state sponsor of terrorism list.

Unlike many businesses who sell to them, I have not been bribed by Saudi Arabia and I am not prepared to turn a blind eye to any kingdom which sponsors terrorism.

The split in the GCC countries against Qatar is a case of the pot calling the kettle ""black"". They are implicated with the sponsorship of terrorism and it seems unfair to name Qatar without also naming Saudi Arabia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Whether we agree or quibble over the details of which countries ought to go on the list I agree absolutely that names need adding."

"Last year, there were about 19,300 auto thefts in Colorado, and only about 2700 arrests (14%).  It's difficult to find the conviction and incarceration rate.  It's a difficult crime to prove, and it's not considered to be a violent crime.  Most of them are plea bargained down and given probation.  We save our prison space for more serious violators and it costs too much to execute petty thieves.

Ah, the humanity of people like you.

We had a car stolen several years ago.  The cops eventually found it in Montbello.  We'd already settled with Allstate, but they made us come pick it up.  Had a young black kid, about 15, in the squad car.  A few months later, I got a letter from the court asking me what my actual damages were.  I answered truthfully.  We got more for the car from Allstate than it was worth, and the kid did us a favor.  Give him a break and maybe he'll turn his life around.  If he can hotwire a car and drive it off in under a minute, he has a future in auto mechanics."
"What you are really saying is that neighbours should have a veto - basically an arbitrary property right - over your ability to sell your property to the highest bidder.  
.
Have they purchased that property right?  No.
.
Is there any basis in law for such a right? No.
.
The idea is NIMBYism run wild.  The same basic arguments were used two generations ago to try to enforce ""covenants"" not to sell to black people or Jews.
.
Have we learned nothing from that experience?
.
If you don't like your new neighbours, or you don't like that they have received planning permission to adapt the property to a higher valued use, you are free to sell your property to the highest bidder, accordingly.

What your neighbour has done, most likely, is to make your property more valuable.
If the neighbour were imposing a negative externality on you, you might have grounds for complaint.  But you're gaining a windfall - and still complaining!"

"Even if eating meat gave us immortality, I feel unnecessarily ending the life of another precious living being is immoral. The law is on your side at the moment but denying women and people of color equal rights, for example, was legal at one time as well.

I doubt the life of any human is worth the unnecessary suffering and death of our animal friends. The key word there is""unnecessary"" and in almost every case killing others is now unnecessary in this modern world."
"China's ""cruel detainment"" is a step up from what happens in many other countries around the world, where government critics mysteriously disappear.

"I'm not frustrated, I'm at very low risk of being shot by police. Situations where objectively ""the suspect clearly and obviously attacked police"" rarely occur outside a vacuum. Life is messy, life is unpredictable. In every police shooting video I've seen thus far I could understand how the police justified using their weapon. In all but one video I could see how people took exception.

One trend that I've noticed in the videos I've seen is that the suspects tend to be very resistant to the officers. This alone doesn't justify being shot, but it escalates the situation significantly. In some its hard to tell if they are fighting officers or just trying to protect themselves.

In my opinion, the exclusivity of their message limits how much change they will affect. From what I've seen they will only assemble when a black person has been shot by police and there's room to question their tactics. It's their right."

tended to increase the supply of low-skilled, low-wage labor available. The Commission found
also that about six in 10 adult black males have a high school diploma or less, and are
disproportionately employed in the low-skilled labor market in likely competition with
immigrants. Evidence for negative effects of such competition ranged from modest to
significant, according to the experts who testified, but even those experts who viewed the effects as modest overall found significant effects in occupations such as meatpacking and construction.""

I find it inspiring rather than disappointing that so many across the NFL stood in unison with their ""son of a b"" teammates. 
I personally find it astonishing that people cannot accept a peaceful form form of protest and concern. It in no way indicates someone is less respectful or patriotic than you just because you stand and they don't. I actually find it quite disturbing that many people are perfectly fine watching and cheering for black athletes on their team - as long as they behave well - as soon as they have an opinion different then theirs and are out of line in their eyes, they go ballistic.

"The columnist is unhelpfully vague when she uses the word ""telling"", where she writes:

""British actor Mark Rylance made a few telling comments about the ways in which supporting actors actually often play in opposition to main characters and that OPPOSING WITHOUT HATING seems to be something women are particularly good at.""

I dunno, could the good Mr. Rylance's words not equally well be applied to many of the loud men in the Toronto and Vancouver chapters of ""Black Lives Matter"" and their ongoing crusades against the police?

In other words, is it really that ""telling"", the assumed boundaries of Mr. Rylance's verbal applicability?"
"your post just shows the bias ignorance that the left lives in,, of all the stuff that needs done THIS is one of the most important loser. what a great bunch of leaders finaly in the congress for a change.  the usa is getting fianly real change that helps unlike the bs nonsense obama and the dems rammed onto people no one voted for pal.  tits getting better since ridding the system of the government mandates and taxes etc means less costs for health insurance ,, but as usual when you use the term ""black guy"" you prove you are nothing but an ignorant racist bent on hate rather than facts"

"The reaction has absolutely nothing to do with Boxing.

It's conflating 'idiot' , 'scrappy' and 'Aboriginal'.

""We were looking for an idiot shifty Jew""

""We were looking for an idiot drunk Irishman""

""We were looking for a thuggish Black man""

These are racist statements.

"The Gasping Old Party can't win because they have alienated the vast majority of women, Blacks, Latinos, Asians, Millennials, LGBTs, the poor - the list goes on.  And this continues despite the 'autopsy' the party big wigs held years back that concluded the Republican'ts must have a 'bigger tent.'  So much for that. 

How shameful that Murkowski, Sullivan and Young are all in for Trump. That is proof positive that they don't listen to the people they are supposed to represent, and put party over all else.  They'll own that for years and years. Pathetic."
"“There is a profound misunderstanding of what race really is,” Harvard anthropology professor Daniel Lieberman said at an event the night after the presidential debate. “Race is a scientifically indefensible concept with no biological basis as applied to humans.”

That alone is a killer to an Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson let alone Black Lives Matters movement. 

Also most people are unaware that the term ""African American"" and  ""African American community"" is widely incorrectly used by many. The term “African-American” only appropriately applies to descendants of Africans brought to America as slaves. There are many, many people of dark skin color in American, some having African heritage but not all are descendants of those who were slaves.

It's way past time to start being a part of humanity and forget about using those childish crayons."

He is a Breitbart propagandist and is the main person that is helping Bannon in his campaign to get Pope Francis to resign or at least sidelined because Francis could successfully oppose Bannon's campaign of bigotry and hatred against brown non-Christian people.  More interesting to me about this story is that it was first reported in Lifesite News which is run by Burke's buddies.  It is almost like there is an alliance between Burke and Bannon and their allies on these things.
No I just read the article. I didn't know we were to include everything we ever researched. As for Eugenics and doing away with the black race that was Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood.
"Using places like Langbaan and Pok Pok as proof that Sen Yai should have no problem charging $11 for noodles is a mistake.  Langbaan and Pok Pok are black swans.  You can't use them as indicators of what's normal.  Pok Pok came on the scene with perfect timing, moving from cart to restaurant and garnering tons of press both local and national.  I see more Ubers in front of that place than many downtown steakhouses.  A good number of their customers go there to say they went to Pok Pok, not because they have a palate that begs for traditional and unusual Thai dishes.  Same with Langbaan (which has like 10 seats).

What they should have done was call it Pok Pok Noodle House to get some of those foodies to follow the brand in the door."
"No, you misunderstand, Larry. I'm not suggesting that we need efforts to compensate for past injustices -- I'm suggesting that we need efforts to correct for CURRENT injustices. Voting rights are still being denied based on spurious suggestions of voter fraud (which is virtually non-existent, except in the fevered minds of Republican operatives). Some Republicans have even been courageous (or stupid) enough as to admit that their efforts to restrict voting -- which disproportionately affect (otherwise legitimate) Democratic voters -- are intended to help Republicans win elections. Similarly, it's obvious that there is widespread discrimination against black Americans in policing and other areas. These injustices require attention, and won't be cured by hiding behind the notion that we're beyond race."
"President Elect Trump alrready proved he is on the right road to healing the black inner city problems.  He got 15% of the black votes, the most ever given a Republican.   I know it's not the huge numbers the Democrats have but in terms of healing it's a  great beginning, the wonderful american black community are paying attention."
"You have to look at this from BLM's point of view. In order for their organization to remain relevant they have to be the ""victim"". They have NO interest in making peace with police otherwise they would not have thrown their little temper-tantrum and demanded the police ban. BLM worldwide receives millions in funding. They have to create division and bully us so that, when we react, they can claim that we are the racist ones and are treating them unfairly. Then they still have a cause. BLM is a hate group and does NOT represent the majority of the Black community."
"The power SCOTUS exercises that you don't like are the limits on state legislative action. Madison wanted passed a 16th article of the Bill of Rights through the House. The Senate killed it and he did not fall on his sword for it. The 14th Amendment completed the Bill of Rights. They act because states victimize minorities, from blacks, to women, to gays, to Latinos, to immigrants to Catholics in Alabama."

"According to this site, there are only nine (9) black students at the U of O Law School.  I can see why they would tire of questions from very many of the other 357 law students or 67 faculty, much less the rest of the University of Oregon.

Of course, with 16% of the Law School faculty being part of a minority, a few of them ought to have a clue.  

And ""The faculty of University of Oregon School of Law is 53% women, one of the highest percentages of female faculty across all law schools (average: 41%)."" 

So gender bias ought to be understood by some of the faculty as well and give some insight.

"..and what percentage of cops are guilty of this???
A very very very small percentage.
Why don't we focus our energies on black on black violence in the inner city.
Far more people die from that than police violence yet there is no outrage by BLM or
any other national group. Why is that?
A 10% reduction in black on black crime would save far more lives than a 10% reduction in lost lives due to police misconduct.
And why is it that the BLM and other groups ignore the large number of deaths in black on black crime?  Because it doesn't fit their agenda."
Are the cops out there murdering black people? The media sure thinks so.
"I undestood that most mines are public companies in which shares, which anyone who can afford it can buy, are traded on a daily basis.
Why then do we need to legislate that X% of shares should belong to black people? Maybe they haven't bought shares because they don't want them.
What will happen is the 30% will be snaffled up by the already wealthy black elite who don't seem to be doing much about improving the lot of their less fortunate countrymen, so I'm not sure how this will help the folks in the townships."

"One day some years ago, my 4 year old son and I were taking an elevator ride at the shopping center. The elevator stopped, the doors opened and in came someone clad in black and face covered with a niqab. My son was startled, grabbed me by my pants and started screamin! That was enough for me. It took me and my wife a week to reassure our boy that the person in black will not come after him and that he is safe."
"You're saying that Trump doesn't lie? What?! We both reside on the same planet, so your reaction can't be explained by astronomical separation.

I can understand why you might dismiss Australian success with gun laws, but why cast its mention as a lie? You expressed an opinion; Sid expressed an opinion. If an opinion is a lie then it's just as likely that you must be lying, too. It would be better to explain your thinking. Australia's results are so extraordinary that I think it takes extraordinary logic to argue that such steps would have no effect in the U.S.

Sid's description of Trump's actions and words regarding Puerto Rico are also interpretations derived from facts, not fantasy. I can understand why you wouldn't agree with how he's stating them, but those things actually happened. Just take one - what was your reaction to Trump tossing paper towel rolls?"
"Far more rampant than any form of racist police discrimination is the plague of fatherlessness in the black community. Children living with their married biological parents are the least likely to commit criminal acts. It has been widely reported for years now that the out-of-wedlock birth rate among American blacks is over 70 percent.  Yet, when it comes to this grave matter, Colin Kaepernick and his NFL ilk are virtually silent.  

Far more rampant that racist police discrimination is the proliferation of black on black violence over drug turf.  If you really want to stand against something, pick something that really matters and makes a difference, not what you've been told by your groupthink echo chamber is ""THE"" issue."

"The vitriol presently directed at President Trump and his family is just a mirror image of the vitriol that was directed at President Obama and his wife Michelle. We can be opposed to the policies of those who disagree with us, but what we have now is directed toward persons and their identities. Conservatives never could get beyond the fact that President Obama was a Black man, despite his being raised in a Caucasian family, graduating from Punahou School and initially putting out his hand to them to work with him. The Kennedys were as wealthy as the Trumps, but they were not criticized by the press for their wealth. The Democratic elite is as race / ethnicity conscious as the Republicans. The agenda of both parties should be to generate policies which will lift up all those of those in need regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, age, religious beliefs sexual orientation, etc."

"also Roger the dodger the NFL commissioner should be fired, when the Dallas Cowboys wanted to wear a sticker on there helmets in honor of the Dallas police officers who got ambushed and killed by a black man in Dallas Rodger said you cannot wear those stickers because it breaks the NFL rules or when a player wanted to wear shoes that honored the 9/11 victims could not do that either so now he says its alright for these felon bums to take a knee to spit on our flag and country, time for the hypocrite American hater roger to step down as commissioner of the National Felon League."
"I replied to that in my reply to my own post (just above this post).  I'm curious why, in 2016, Trump only got 8% of the black vote, but in the key Southern State of South Carolina, he carried 26% of the black vote.  Why did that happen?

Nikki Haley, a Tea Party Conservative, won her re-election in 2014 for Governor of South Carolina with 56% of the vote in a state that's 31% black.  How is that possible?"
Why don't the Catholics move to Africa and the blacks move to Northen Ireland?  Then maybe we'd finally have a lasting peace.

"Keep the statues;  add the context. Add new statues to  honor the  large  numbers were denied their human rights and more than 50% were denied their civil rights.  Some people still are. Change came from hard work, endurance, and putting their life on the line. More change is needed.

Give memorials special consideration. Every person in the war, soldier  and civilian, free or slave, was someone's family. People are not infallible. Honor the dead person; learn from his choices.  Historical figures had imperfect lives. For scientists, it it's easier to honor the science even when the person was not always honorable.

I would agree Asian immigrants lower crime rates.

Only First Nation people have a higher murder and violent crime rate.

But the Rox are going to need to keep up this pitching with a bunch of kids and Chatwood, who is like Jekyl and Hyde.  I hope they can do it.

I was referring to the neo-Nazi's and the like with those trying to use violence to stop them. I'm not the Denver post or MSM - I don't link being conservative with hate groups. I find the BLM crowd to be just as racist as the KKK. Both are groups that divide.

Just saying to trust people that clearly have issues to not hurt anyone while they use the wrong bathroom is insane. It's like telling someone not to not wear a seat belt because you probably won't get in an accident anyways.   This is clearly about people with issues wanting to force their chosen lifestyle on others.  Nothing could be more simple---if your a man , use the men's bathroom . If your a woman , use the women's . If your confused as to what you are , check your own birth certificate or do a self check in front of a mirror  .  Problem solved.

When did He EVER discriminate against anyone?   Was his life all about fomenting hate against anyone?  I have not met many modern Christians who seem to even know who Jesus was and what Jesus was about.  And, if you read the Bible, the Torah, the Qu'ran, they all have one overriding principle in common.  They all say that God NEVER gave the right to man to judge each other.  In fact, that is a right God held back only for Himself.  And God NEVER says anywhere in any of the religious texts that there is anything wrong with homosexuality.  What there is, however, is room for people with their own prejudices and reasons for fomenting hate to interpret or misinterpret scripture toward their own hateful agenda.  They've used it to justify the subjegation of women, children, and people of color since it was written."

Some of his arguments about judgements on legislation  and the idea that people don't make mistakes and even take responsibility for them is flawed.

If you're a woman who has been required to do more than men are required to do in situations and there are no rules in place to demand you do it, all women would be ticked off.  Heck Senator Sanders said when he was on the campaign trail sometime ago on the west coast the families taxes would be shared in a day or so.  But his taxes weren't shared, and this years taxes weren't done close to deadline.  Secretary Clinton shared 30 years of taxes immediately.

The PM and his fellow one percenters are never going to have to compete with these new arrivals for scarce social housing, for black market construction jobs or find themselves in emergency wards filled with people who have never contributed a dime in taxes. So we will simply get empty platitudes about Canada being a land of immigrants and no stopping of the flow.

"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate.

"Of course Obama had a lot of superdelegates.  His surge started way before Bernie's (much smaller) surge.  And was way bigger (no surprise that Dems would be crawling all over themselves to jump on the first viable black POTUS candidate bandwagon).  

50 superdelegates did swap from Hillary to Obama later in the process, but that wasn't anywhere close to the 450 early-declared superdeegate lead that Hillary had over Bernie.  

Also, Obama and Hillary both occupied a similar lane in the middle of the Dem spectrum.  Bernie was in his own socialist lane (the far left of the party).  The only reason he even got more than the usual 10% or so for an extremist is because Hillary was such a bad candidate (the same reason that Trump beat her, in fact)."
"This is what I said: ""I feel her actions were an error in judgment....not a malicious act. I felt the cries for her resignation were unjustified"" I feel disciplinary measures, whether by the criminal justice system, public employers such as the U of O or school districts, private employers, parents or any other agency with powers to ""discipline"" should be appropriate and measured.  I certainly recognize that some (perhaps many) Black students were offended by Ms Shurtz's actions.  I've never said otherwise.  I've also said, and I repeat, I don't feel her actions deserved the cries for her resignation or dismissal...perhaps a letter of reprimand in her file or whatever....but, certainly, not dismissal.  Thank you for asking,  Gary Crum"
"Yeah. That's not what happened. So who is this ""we?"" And no, million shares of independent voters were plucked out of the process. And Hillary does not own the vote of African American voters, particularly those under 35. That is I false, disgusting narrative."
"Had he made this comment about an African American, a Latino or a GLBT, he would have been fired on the spot...it's still ok to make racially insensible remarks about Asians (see Colbert or Biden)"
Prog:   I don't hear protests about black on black violence.   But that's none of my business (takes sip of Chardonnay).
"Interesting how you ""perceive"" my comments. I did not say BLM had control over all Blacks. I said that a group of protestors shouting that we want dead cops now would be an example of inciting violence. BLM and many in the media do not glorify those that shout those things, then in the next breath, justify the emotion that creates the phrase. Since many on the left, you and BLM, are not happy that that an officer is facing a murder charge in a shooting incident in Georgia, then it seems that you would prefer that the officer not have any benefit from our system of justice. No long wait for the prosecution and defense to prepare for trial, No need to wait for a jury to decide guilt or innocence, he is guilty. Just convict the officer right now and pass sentence on him. From the way that you, BLM and many on the left say, it just seems obvious you would have no problem with lynching the officer. I do not call for lynching. Your statements and those of BLM seem to support it."
"HI DG!  

I'm re.reading w/I wrote you & it's this:

""these ARE the people who show up when most others would run. they DO protect. they DO save lives. targeting cops or targeting soldiers - just wrong. not to say they are top notch individuals, but as a group - they deserve respect. the shooter targeted a group - i’ll bet not one cop killed had ever killed a black person - or any person. eye for an eye? not the answer""

My take and I beg your pardon if this doesn't connect because I also thought that Icon and SD were saying the same thing is the focus was this contributors (the citizen) was so outwardly racist.  That said..

I think just showing up isn't enough....they applied for the job.  It is a highly stressful job no doubt but too many folks are acting out this guys racists words and that's what the focus was about.  I really appreciate your viewpoints DG/.  That shooting is worrisome just as much as all of the African Americans are being murdered.  I value ur comments DG.

"Disgusting. You think protesting cops shooting unarmed blacks is the same as neo-Nazis and the KKK?


Don't take this the wrong way, but is there something in your water?"
"I read McElroy's remarks and saw the playback (where there was audio).  It is wrong to characterize this as an anti-Trump event as it would have happened anyway.  Sadly, there was no audience participation, which may have broadened the opinions expressed.  There is a place for liberty in Catholic thought - without human freedom we are moral automatons.  That is not virtue, it is moral tyranny.

Carson does not have the self-respect to realize that he is getting the ""black seat"" at the cabinet table.  That lack of self-awareness disqualifies them (as well as the lack of experience in housing).  He should be at HHS, not HUD, except that he is fringe either way.

If the Spectator says something, I believe the opposite.  Francis is charitable, but sometimes the Truth hurts.  The right wing is never comfortable hearing the prophetic voice. Reactionaries hate prophesy."

There should be the same reaction to smearing Harry for his forebears than there is for smearing honest, hard-working blacks for the higher crime in their neighbourhoods they also have nothing to do with.

"You don't need to be a climatologist to do research on global warming.  I've been researching it for over 20 years and he is spot on.  We are headed for a world where scarcity of food and water, ecosystem collapse and mass species extinction will be the norm.  As I write this approx. 20 million people are dying of starvation in three countries in the horn of Africa due to drought which brought on famine.  This is real and it's going to get real ugly.  There are climate refugees all over the planet that are having to leave their homelands as they no longer can support communities.   Wake up, folks!  Denial is decreasing our chances of having a decent way of life for humans and all other life on this small planet possible.

"Thanks, ATF.  I see his suggestion as a two-sided coin, one side where any progression and inclusion of women is good and the other as one more way for women to be both separate and still not equal.  

Although racism and sexism in the US are still horrific problems, how much worse would they be today had voting rights not been extended to blacks and women, where all the provisions of the Civil Rights Act had been tempered so fully participatory meant ""advisory,"" where rampant racial discrimination was still legal in employment, educational, housing, etc., policies and practices?  I don't think the examples are extreme.  Discrimination is discrimination, no matter the traditions or rationales used to prop it up.  

I don't get why THEY don't get it.  What keeps them so freaking blind, even when men like this Cardinal obviously have valuable viewpoints on other issues (and even tangentially on this one)?  The obvious just eludes them, and it puzzles as well as infuriates me."
"What "" criminals "" have yelled racism to circumvent arrest ? From what I've seen the ones in the news couldn't yell anything because they were killed . Like Philando Castille for example ? Poor guy was pulled over for being black . The excuse the officer gave was total bs and he'd been pulled over for doing nothing another dozen times or so . But I guess he fits your description of a "" criminal "" . At least he has the right skin color apparently . 
  And funny how some people are so ""terribly offended"" by this protest all of a sudden . Players have been kneeling since last season and because Trump says something about it all of his followers are up in arms and they're "" boycotting "" the NFL . If they cared so damn much about disrespecting the flag then why didn't they walk away a long time ago ? It's because they really don't care about "" respect "" otherwise they'd demand their president show some once and a while ."

Yes, I'm sure that when businesses were told they had to serve blacks, you screamed in indignation. Many of those racists claimed that their racism was based on their religious beliefs. You display EXACTLY the same mindset.

And clearly you have borne a grudge for many years (something that you claim is wrong to do) because you once experienced a minor piece of racism at the hands of some blacks. Now, I agree that they were wrong to treat you as they did, but it should have made you consider the evils of racism. Apparently, itonly made you resentful -- an attitude you also say is wrong."

And do you honest believe these cops shoot these black men without some form provocation, and not just because of the color of skin. It was proven the shooting of Michael Brown was a justified shooting and to this day we still the ""Hands up Don't shoot"" chat. These protesters don't want justice, they want to see any cop who happens to shoot a black man, taken out and hung."

"I think we simplify why people cling to religious identity. In Africa, the ones who didn't have a strong religious identity were converted by the European colonizers. The Muslim population stuck to religion as an identity (nationalism came in much later, and is an amorphous concept). 

The ones who stick to their religion don't integrate, or more importantly get a modern education. That begins a vicious circle of social immobility, and sticking to religion. However, looking down on someone's religion does not make them less religious. Accepting them does. India, for instance, allows religious laws to apply for marriage and inheritance, if a Muslim chooses to (there are civil laws, which apply according to ones choice). 

Along with the vote, that is a large reason that ISIS has more members from most western countries, despite India having 180 million Muslims (France has 5 million Muslims, and over 1000 members in ISIS, India has 60; Canada has over 100, USA has over 300)."

   National anthems aren't sacred; human life is sacred.
   This protest against police shootings of African-Americans should have been done during Obama's presidency; better late than never. Shootings were happening quite frequently several years ago. Obama's hands were tied, his mouth was sealed, by Republican obstructionism (and likely as well by his unwillingness to rock the establishment's boat).
   Today, ""Take a knee"" seems like a protest against Trump. That waters down the effect because almost everyone's protesting against Trump.
  Further I doubt the commitment of multi-millionaire black football heroes to rocking the boat.
  But much better than no protest at all."
"I agree with Marissa Kerns on her take on the state's AJA community.  They do have a cronyistic setup, for sure.

Like blacks on the mainland, AJAs vote monolithicly, like about 90%, for Dems.  I don't think they do any research on who they vote for.  As long as the candidate has D behind his/her name, they vote accordingly.

Of course, the Republicans also are to blame as they don't have many candidates to offer.

Not sure about Hawaii, but other states prepare and send out booklets detailing each candidate's credentials and positions.  This info helps the voters make a more informed decision."

Those 2 groups metastasized into the Tea Party which did a bang up job at stopping Obama at every turn.  Couple that with the right wing scream machine and you had the perfect storm."

"Which historian has argued that significant numbers of black troops fought for the CSA? Where? Using what sources? You're making  a fabulously provocative claim w/out any sources. 

The only thing I know like that concerns a group of free men of color in New Orleans who tried, unsuccessfully, to enlist in the Confederate forces as a unit, The Louisiana Native Guards.

When Union forces took New Orleans in 1862(?) however,  the Native Guards enlisted in the UNION army. They guarded POW's in coastal Mississippi and fought at the Battle of Pascagoula . . . for the Union. 

Black Union troops fought heroically at any number of battles, often suffering horrendous casualty rates: Port Hudson, Fort Pillow, Battery Wagner, Nashville, the Battle of the Crater and others. 

Where did black CSA troops do this?

"True Doug, just as Prime Minister Trudeau and his Liberal Party were elected here in Canada.  We march to a different drummer here.  Possibly because we have protected our electoral process and fought against gerrymandering and the like."
"As for any survey, the challenge is self-selection. Even using a randomized method, participants have to decide to participate. A lengthy, somewhat intrusive (one presumes) interview about health and one's life is dependent on characteristics and qualities of each individual participant. Easy to mount an argument that individuals who have experienced much discrimination would decline the opportunity to share personal information with a research team. The team potentially being viewed as authority and elite. On the other hand, PEW research suggests it is actually higher educated blacks are more likely to report discrimination and perceptions of racism. 

HabFan410 raises a legitimate question experience and perception. Unless the experience is blatant, one must ask whether perception rather than an actual event(s) is being reported. Then again, a high level of perceived discrimination still indicates a problem."
What a joke. Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country. Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians. They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything. Pot calling the kettle black for sure. The manipulation and hypocrisy coming from the democrats is mind boggling to say the least. But we must understand they are drinking a kool aid that distorts the mind. Its called free lovism and situational ethics. Hail Hillary!!!!
"So if you wish to pick and chose from history that which supports your opinion, lease note that there is much more than George Wallace and Dixiecrats, there was much more going on whose remnants remain today.
Many Black people like Mr. Farrakan, a extremely educated man, one who was immersed early on in the refined areas of society, also an accomplished violinist among many talents, knew this as he sought to free his people from those chains, give them the pride of liberty over their own destiny and future. Mr. Farrakan is a racist in the view of many, but even as a charismatic anti-Semitic, he saw the psychological chains of slavery being put on his people. 
Many Blacks who are not racists arealso now realizing looking at their own people, especially the high murder rate which constitutes the majority of murders in America, the chains of poverty has become not only a means of generational enslavement, but a genocide of their own people, as they speak out."
"Obviously, as a noted scholar of the Holocaust, Dr. Marrus could not be a racist, so it is appropriate that the College did not sever ties with him. However, his failure to understand that these days certain things are not fit subjects for levity is still regrettable; but incidents like this, even without major measures being taken in response, will no doubt lead to greater public awareness of this within the affected community.

People don't get away with joking about the Holocaust these days, and no one should really be surprised that black people have feelings about the era of slavery too. Just as some of our sports teams are considering changing their names, now that (apparently) we've discovered that people of First Nations origin actually still exist and have feelings too.

There are times when I do feel that political correctness is taken to excess, but it's not excessive that we're simply realizing that respect is for all groups, not just those we're used to."
"Thank you so much Keala Kelly for providing a razor sharp critique of DisneyMoanaʼs colonialism. I completely agree with your linking of Disney's cultural imperialism to America's political imperialism in Hawaiʻi and other parts of Oceania. These interlocking systems of domination, as Black feminist Bell Hooks argues, and they are damaging to the well-being of all Indigenous Peoples. The U.S. occupation of Hawai'i is intricately linked to the destructive forces of militarism, tourism, TMT's desecration of the sacred Mauna Kea, capitalism, and cultural poaching. Mahalo nui for providing this insightful link."
"But according to the CBC, Toronto Star and the Globe & Mail, it is the fascists (the alt right) who are the most serious threat to western democracies.  Forget the Islamic terrorists.

"KalleJ, you throw a lot of insults - accusing me of being close minded, unkind, unmerciful and disrespectful.  I suggest that insults should not be part of a civilized discussion.

Exclusion does not promote inclusion; Black Lives Matter is a very divisive group.
"Here's a wikipedia definition of black humor for you.  It has nothing to do with racism. 

 ""Black comedy, also known as black humor or dark comedy, is a sub-genre of comedy and satire where topics and events that are usually treated seriously are treated in a satirical manner while still being portrayed as the negative events that they are. Typical targets are death, (mass) murder, suicide, blackmail, (domestic) violence, disease, insanity, handicaps, environmental disasters, famine, fear, child pornography/abuse, drug abuse, rape, castration, war, terrorism, racism, sexism, homophobia, bestiality and line-cutting. ""  Please note that ""insanity (mental illness) is one of the topics included.  

I spent 28 years teaching and counseling dysfunctinal adolescents and don't really need your condescensing comments relating to working with disturbed kids. 

 Additionally, if you intend to lecture me on ""black humor"", please first become familiar with its definition."
"Dude you seem to be really hung up on race, as are most liberals when they run out of factual and reasoned arguments, which is pretty much always. It's their get out of jail free card, so to speak.
Once and for all; millions of us, at least half of the country, the informed half, oppose Obama because he is the leader of a hopelessly radicalized  far left Democrat party that seeks to impose it's all powerful government agenda on the American public by any means. The Constitution is nothing more than an impediment to their aims. Obama and his ilk see themselves as our betters and as a matter of policy they have one set of rules for us and one set of rules for them. RACE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
I could give you a list of conservative black (and women)  leaders who dared to get off the liberal plantation only to be unfairly attacked in the worst personal ways. They couldn't defeat them in the battle of ideas so they take the debate to the sewer.
Any of them would dwarf Obama in a debate"
"Hello Charles. I for one have grown weary of the race card thrown at every opportunity. You have stated here that you vote for the dem. party because at least they give you the crumbs from the table. I'm going to put this out there for you. What are you doing to help the black community? What are the blacks in the inner cities doing to better their own destiny? There is not a single one of us who can change the past, we must look to the future and quit supporting failed policies. That needs to come from all sides. Just bemoaning about the failures we as a nation have done to our inner cities and race relations gets us nowhere, in fact it just keeps us stuck. Do you want a better country for everyone? Do you think then that since we see so many failed policies we should try something different? Do you think maybe quite a few folks can begin by cleaning up their own side of the street?  I know it is harder to do the hard work instead of just complaining about the past but isn't it time?"
"If a government official, acting in that capacity, preaches about the Christ, he is clearly breaking the law. If you don't know that, then you should go back to your law school and demand a retroactive failing grade in constitutional law. I'm sure that Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947) was touched on in that class -- when I took a constitutional law class, the professor discussed Justice Black's majority opinion at length."
"thanks for the dialogue.  Jim Crowe is not long gone.   People are wanting to keep statues that revere that stage of our country.  The fact remains that not only our financial institutions are structurally biased against poor people and blacks in particular, but the police and our drug laws and penal system are biased.   And Jeff Sessions is making sure they become more biased after some progress has been made."
"Where is the outrage? The ink on the newspaper is not even dry.  We all should be outraged by racist attacks and by the non-racist carnage occurring daily in our cities and towns like the black-on-black murders in Chicago, which rarely get reported in the media.  Why is that?  I think it is because the non-racist carnage is the new norm in America and of not much interest to many Americans whereas a racist attack such as in this story is of more interest and better for readership.  And why did you have to politicize it by suggesting Trump is not doing anything about it?  You seem not to know that primary responsibility for law enforcement in the U.S. belongs to towns, cities and states and not the Federal government.  Trump has spoken out forcefully about the carnage occurring across the U.S. and has urged local authorities to do more to fight it. What other political figure has spoken out about it?"
"Alan...baby....these are not conservatives.  These are your people, liberals, liberal jews, skin heads, blacks, black separatists,  lesbians, LGBTetc.  In other words every fragmented fringe group block of nut burgers balled up is your little party and they support a death cult that uses useful idiots (Palestinians) as their tool of choice to drive a wedge in Israel.   You wanted anarchy?  It's here, it's at your door.  Answer it....go ahead, answer that door."
"Politifact is not a reliable source, especially with respect to 19th-century US History.

Lincoln clearly wanted to deport blacks from the US after the War.

And Booth managed to murder the man who could have treated the South much better than the Bloody Shirt Republicans ever did.  Lincoln probably would have treated the South with charity rather than malice;  consequently, many of the problems extant today would not have occurred.

See his speeches also.  Especially in Southern Illinois Lincoln went to great lengths to express his general disdain for blacks. The political Lincoln tempered that view when he spoke to audiences in Northern Illinois.

The Emancipation Proclamation also showed Lincoln's political dexterity.  He used that decree to kept the French &

How come this country is the only country in the world where our police shoot mentally ill people? There are hundreds of videos from around the world where smart strained police take down knife-wielding people w/o lethal force. It makes me ashamed to be an American."

"I agree with Paul Racher however it's not a simple task ahead.  The Canadian government may have gotten the land cheap and not fulfilled its agreed payment but at the same time if the land hadn't been taken over it would be worth only a fraction of what it is now.  Without the change in land usage, Canada would have remained in value like many African or South American countries and we would most likely be being exploited by US, Russia & China.  How do we reconcile two very opposite understandings of land ownership?  I would like nothing more than to find a compromise that fits both First Nations needs and those of other Canadians but I don't see that happening right now. Breaking Canada back into dozens of individual self governing nations doesn't seem to be a viable way forward since we lose the strength of being one united large country. Plus many people are currently saying no because they want finality not ongoing payments and recriminations forever."

"<Your comments are ludicrous.>
They are. But there was always a method to this filthy, racist madness:
1. Claim falsely that Obama was not born in the United States, demand that he produce a birth certificate -- forcing him either to comply with a bad-faith demand or allow the lie to fester; then challenge the birth certificate.
2. Claim falsely that Obama was a Muslim -- forcing him to deny that he was a Muslim with the awkward (and utterly false) implication that being a Muslim is somehow a bad thing.
3. Demand Obama's academic transcripts because after all a black man could not have gone to, still less done well at, Harvard Law School.
There are scarcely words (at least printable ones) to describe how despicable are the ideas this poster is pushing."
"I am just amazed at the number of people who do not agree with you.

"Trump got a higher percent of the black vote in South Carolina than Nikki Haley got 2 years earlier.

While Asians were discriminated against and exploited, and the Japanese rounded up into internment camps during WWII, they weren't enslaved for centuries or subjected to a systematic regime of terrorism for almost 80 years, or denied the accumulation of wealth that enables communities to prosper over time. The United States grew wealthy on the backs of African slaves.

"""Not a good sign.""

Yeah, there's alot of ""Not a good sign(s)"" Starting with people who think the military somehow owns the flag instead of seeing it as a nations flag. These same people have never served ""My Dad was in Nam!"" ""My brother is in Afghanistan"" doesn't count as ""served"", yet that's an argument I've heard more than once. It's the 'ol ""I have a black friend"" so I'm not racist card. Second verse same as the first. They don't understand brother.

Above all the guy has class, something totally lacking in a certain GOP candidate right now."

"Has Nancy Pelosi come out and denounce the female legislator from Kansas who posted ""she hopes Trump is assassinated? Those who watch CNN, have they done an in depth story on this legislator, a Kansas Senator. Has the DP done a story. Have any Republican come out an denounce her?
 
Are those words ""hate""? Would that then be hate on the other side? So both side engage in hate, and violence, and intolerance, expect one side ALWAYS get a pass, and then decries how divided the country is since Trump was elected. Time for the media and Democrats to take a long hard look in a mirror, a long with elected Republicans. These are the sides the country is divided, they left didn't get their way, Hillary lost. Bigotry, is defined as ""intolerance towards those who hold a different opinion then ones self"" Who is intolerant over the election of 
 Donald Trump? This Kansas Senator? Pelosi? The media? BLM? Arfait (sp)? all the above."
"Charles ...not everyone looks to the government to pay all of their bills and supply them with every one of life's little pleasures ...pay their power/rent/daycare/buy their food/day care/health care. They also don't value their own lives based upon what the government thinks its value is. When rural people fall on hard times they don't start crying for another government program to take care of them ... they look at each other and they look first at themselves first. Secondly, rural people may seem poor to a stranger looking from outside but most of those families think they live blessed lives and even find a way to give to other people. Poverty is a state of mind and people are responsible for their own happiness ...not the government. Don't you see how the left uses black people every 2 years then kick them to the curb in favor of the next up and coming victim class ...Hispanics!

"You were lucky then. I grew up in both a small town and rural area of southeast MO, where the Ozarks met the Mississippi River bottoms. If you weren't WASP you were ignored at best and you don't  want to know the at worst.  My third grade school teacher was my Catholic godmother. My fifth grade teacher taught us about the evils of the Catholic Church and how it killed god fearing real Christians for reading the Bible and led prayers asking that we all come know Jesus. amen. There were at least three Catholic kids in that class.  In high school my advanced French class was made to sing a rather nasty song about a monk who broke all of vows and the various ways he did so.  Crosses were still being burned in the country and a barn or two as well. The neighboring county where my family came from, had no black residents into the 1990's. Any who tried to move in, even as hired help, would be warned it wasn't a good idea to stay too long...it was always understood too well."
"exactly, the US government fought the war to maintain the union. The 13th Amendment did not have the support it needed to pass when Lincoln used an executive order to free the slaves. He recognized that freeing the slaves would spell the end for the confederacy by enticing slaves to leave their ""owners"". provide more soldiers and general cause chaos in the Confederacy. In the absence of the slaves the Confederacy was doomed, The system of slavery had already ensure their demised but abolishing slavery just moved up the time line. The US government was right to maintain the union and prevent the death of a democratic form of government that was unique in the world and abolishing slavery was a tool in that endeavor."

"IRT Larry01: It is difficult to say it has ""worked out well"", for those who have not seen the salary increase, and especially for minorities. Blacks have done very poorly the last eight years. Those who have seen their insurance premiums skyrocket haven't dome well. Those who now have thousands of dollars in deductibles haven't done well.  The military is in very bad shape; that's not worked out well. Also, those who have been executed around the world because of JV ISIS haven't dome well. Finally, the last 8 years Democrats have lost over 1000 elected positions in State and Fed. Government, from majorities in Congress  to now an overwhelmingly Republican House, a majority Senate, a huge majority of Governors, and now the Presidency.  The polls all said we were headed in the wrong direction. In my mind, it's hard to say ""And the last eight years worked out well"".

"For reasons unknown, you seem compelled insist that the idea of voluntarily resettling blacks was not all but abandoned by the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, and you disregard Fredrickson's book as well. What is the point of your hobby-horse? What do you think it proves? Lyndon Johnson no doubt held segregationist views much of his life, and Barry Goldwater changed his views on gays because of one of his own relatives.

"Multiple names, multiple aliases. Read the story of the Edmonton Muslim man, kicked out for criminal activity, returned to Pakistan, changed his name, grew a moustache and quickly returned right back to the same Edmonton restaurant where he worked before.

Of course the restaurant owner, who sponsored the little darling BOTH times, knew nothing about this: until he got into a pay dispute with the fraudster, then shazzam, suddenly he looked familiar and the owner squealed on the immigrant. 

Canadian immigration officials floated a story about how the system worked when facial recognition software positively fingered the guy: after he had slipped through the tight security net for a few years though.

And just as Racists once denied that African Blacks or the Australian Aborigines were fully human, the same racist attitude goes on when it comes to Neanderthals. ""We"" always, it seems, want to treat ""others not like us"" ""different""....even when they really aren't.

"It was only a matter of time before endless terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists produced a backlash from the extreme right. But the hate is not confined to these two groups. A vicious rally by the extreme left in London recently showed masked thugs assaulting a protester who simply held a sign saying he believed in free speech. These are the same extremists who dress in black and trash stores in opposition to globalisation. 
Every sector of society has its extremists. It is up to us all to speak out when we see hate, whether it is from the extreme right or the extreme left, whether it is the promotion of hatred in a mosque or any place of worship.

"Russian operatives set up an array of misleading Web sites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior.
The sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook “retargeting” tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.
We could just as easily be describing an effort by the NRA or the RNC.
Except that it was a foreign government intent on undermining American interests.
Even if your put aside questions of collusion, (…and there was),

It is a reflection of whether people decide education is important or not so important. Money has nothing to do with it. Schools have not been chronically underfunded. The government gives extra money to underperforming schools and free lunches. And affirmative action is forced government bias in favor of black and Latino people. And at some point it will end. We still hear excuses for why some people are lazy or unwilling to help their children. There are a lot of programs out there. But they are based on a willingness to focus.

Do we want the country we proudly call ""the land of the free"" to regress to the point where the sign in the window singles out the people they don't serve? I certainly don't think so."
"Thanks for the thoughtful questions. The fact that Oregon is a leader in vote by mail and registering every eligible voter that wants to vote, puts black folks in good shape to vote in Oregon. I think a much better job of dealing with institutional racism is needed. We need to out law racial profiling. Housing and employment discrimination are still problems too. Many of the old Republicans like Hatfield were good on issues of race. The current bunch, not so much. I won't switch party affiliation this year. Defeating Trump is the most important thing to do this election. With Trump, we could be one tweet away from WWIII. Finally, we have to make sure the police protect and serve all of us. EPD is not the worst police dept. but they, like virtually all police departments, have more work to do to deliver equal protection under the law. Norm Stamper, ex-Seattle police chief, has written extensively on race and criminal justice system reform. I suggest reading his book and essays."

"The margins show more D's voted for the bill than Rs.
And that's with the Dixiecrats voting against it.
Democrat JFK called for it in 1963. Democrat LBJ  made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the bully pulpit he wielded as president, in support of the bill. Your assertion that it ""was a politically strategic move that LBJ et al supported once it was clear that blacks were going to be integrated and given the vote, anyway (thanks to Republicans,"") is a farcical lie. The Democrats controlled both the House and Senate by big margins. The Republicans couldn't pass anything on their own.

"Blacks have been marginalized for centuries in the US, arguably our own indiginous people have been as well - yet neither descended into the murderous cult that radicalized Muslims represent.  Many radicals are in fact - not destitute or marginalized. The difference is Islam itself - because of it's many interpretations, it is the ""enabler"" that provides the twisted justification for heinous acts. To what end? Who cares! The solution is starting to form but doesn't seem to get much play in the media - the solution is with the Imams. A cohesive organization of ALL Imams in Canada that publicly and continually  shoot down the notion of Jihad and terrorism - and to publicly accuse all terrorists of apostacy - of sullying the name of Allah.  Canadian Imams should have leadership that has the authority to monitor mosques, Imams and their teachings - in a helpful and respectful way. Can't speak for the rest of the world but it would seem that Canadian Muslims can fix things here."

Your statement that the institutional Church has always opposed exploitation of people is demonstrably false."

"Bryan, I've killed dozens of bears and captured and handled more than that. Never saw hate in a bear's eyes. I've seen curiosity, wariness, fear and desperation. Never hate. 

If you have 10 bears and kill 3 over bait, the remaining adult females can easily add another 3 or more by the next spring. Despite your protestations, as recently as 2014 Fish and Game has admitted that sport hunting and hunter-based control efforts, including bear baiting and even bear snaring, does not reduce black bear populations. The only effective way to reduce a population, so far, has been state employees shooting the bears from helicopters. Even then a black bear population will recover in a few years. http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=pressreleases.pr05292014

". . . the next ""black"" President, or the first ""hispanic"" President, or the first ""middle eastern"" President starts issuing executive orders bannning travel from West European nations.

Never know who from their countries might have clicked on an ISIS propoganda site in the past.  And, then, there's the Las Vegas shooter.  Where are his ancestors from?  Wasn't his evil the result of the stuff that cooked genetically inside of him?

Very simple.  

Thankfully, our Constitution disallows that sort of pretense of thought.

"But wait.  Americans mostly all believe that slavery is not so bad.  Around one percent of our entire population is locked in cages.  Just as in the days of black slavery, the many believe it is okay to deprive so many of liberty, lock them in cages, and control every aspect of their lives.  The Deady Hall issue is perpetrated by the media to distract from real issues of on-going slavery (disproportionately black) that exists right here today.  As with old style slavery, many justifications are given which the masses accept.  Even after we let these people out of cages, we label them as felons or sex-offenders and in so doing continue to control their lives as long as they live.  You think it okay?  So did the slave holders of the past.  I suggest cleaning up one's own house before carping about that of others."

"Funny you should bring up ""those people"" who planned to flee Trump's US.  

I ran across this quote from a letter Abraham Lincoln wrote in 1855 when the Know-Nothings (the American Party) feared for the country's safety due to the immigration of Irish Catholics.

“As a nation, we began by declaring that ‘all men are created equal.’ We now practically read it ‘all men are created equal, except negroes.’ When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ‘all men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.’ When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty—to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.”

Lincoln decided not to emigrate to Russia and stuck around to help ""negroes"" into the created equal category.  Unfortunately ""foreigners"" are still on the list, though we've managed to replace Catholics with Muslims."

"How Trump's Big Fat Racist Mouth Could Put Another Nail In His Coffin
http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/21/books/the-high-price-of-hate.html

Trump began his presidential bid with racist speech when he stated that Mexican immigrants were drug dealers, rapists and murderers

Then he called for a Muslim Ban because he believed that only Muslims could be terrorists

He attacked a Muslim Gold Star family and assumed that the wife was not allowed to speak simply because she was a woman when the truth was that she was overcome by grief

He claimed that African American communities are filled with drug dealers and murderers to the extent that people cannot walk down the street without being shot

He refused to denounce David Duke, the most famous living KKK leader

He started the birtherism movement against our first African American president, claiming that Barack Obama was not a U.S. citizen


He repeatedly shared anti-Semitic tweets during the campaign"
"Exactly! Nobody I went to school with had never heard or had any concept of homosexuality. In my early teens I was shocked to learn of sex between man and woman. ""My mother and father would never do that,"" I remember shouting out.
I learned about homosexuality later through men coming on to me. I encountered men who I would now describe as 'camp' but had no idea what they got up to. Something, instinct, sixth sense or Our Lord maybe, preserved me in my innocence from the advances I was subjected to. None of these advances were from priests or teachers I might add.
In school those picked on were as you say the fat boys, the smelly, the unathletic, the unusual, etc. Now this did not include all the fat, the smelly, etc, which means that personality also played a part.

Just as Corporations are ""individuals,"" I am simply stating that under the law Gays and African Americans (as an example of a race) are both legally equivalent classes or races of people. Therefore, mere sexual preference with regard to discrimination in the workplace is the same as discrimination against race or religious affiliations. I disagree with this idea because there is no proof that people are born gay as a black person is born black. BTW, region is NOT a protected class. Religious freedom is a protected activity under the constitution. You can worship whatever religion you want. I have no position on religious denominations rejecting individuals or groups based on race or sexual identity. I only know God loves everyone-I would like to think equally. Religions all have unique requirements."

"During World War II, African-American enlistment was at an all time high, with more than 1 million serving in the armed forces. However, the U.S. military was still heavily segregated. The air force and the marines had no blacks enlisted in their ranks, and the navy only accepted blacks as cooks and waiters. The army had only five African-American officers. In addition, no African-American would receive the Medal of Honor during the war, and their tasks in the war were largely reserved to noncombat units. Black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the Nazi prisoners of war.

It would take over 50 years and a presidential order before the U.S. Army reviewed their records in order to award any Medals of Honor to black soldiers. This war marked the end of segregation in the U.S. military. In 1948 President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, officially ending segregation and racial inequality in the military."
"Bravo to a 13-year-old writer brave and talented enough to submit her thoughts to the scrutiny of these boards....

... but I will comment on her framing the matter of racism as somehow a matter that one might not understand due to living in a ""privileged environment"" such as a particular neighbourhood in Seattle.

A child invoking the term ""privilege"" so early on in the framing of her argument is troubling. It appears clear (and saddening) that those who have educated her, at this young age, have managed to instill the mindset that privilege is the key to the ethnic/racial tensions in society. And surely applauding that perspective would be Black Lives Matter, who invoke it routinely.

I doubt young children are armed to say back to a teacher, ""I reject your focus on privilege because your privilege-focus overlooks much and is damagingly maladaptive to those embracing it"". And so they embrace the new scripture, young, and a new proselytization replaces religion in education."

"I prefer ASU research over Wiki research.  To many apologists are quoted there.

"It would be really helpful for her to explain more fully the conversation.  Is she saying that she was trying to describe the stories in the newspapers where this parent talked about racism and her/her child being called the n-word and that's when she used the word, or is she saying she couldn't remember the woman's name and she chose that pronoun to refer to her?  The former might be forgivable but the latter... uh, no. 

Given the problems in Georgina, she's probably used to using/hearing the word.  Let's face it, there are places not too far north of Toronto where black people are still referred to as 'darkies'.

On another note, she is 82 years old, its time for new blood on that board...maybe she can use her experience/ serve her community in a volunteer capacity if she cannot be a source of wisdom and leadership for said board."
"As a child of the sixties we fought for civil rights and equality. We had come out of WWII and Korea with the American blacks fighting our wars, relegated to second class citizenry, and came out of slavery to become as a permanent economic underclass. Affirmative action at that time was to give the black population a jump start to economic  equality.  None of us  could have imagined at that time how institutionalized an abused the program would become. I never though that some kid whose parents might have been born in Jamaica in 1972 could be the beneficiary of a program that was targeted to children of Americans who participated in our history and did not enjoy the full benefits of our society.  Sorry to say, I question how our previous President benefited when one of his parents wasn't American, was born to no one who was discriminated against in the  U.S. and benefitted from a program  not  designed as a y'alll come. I would like to keep affirmative action for those it was intended."

"Most Americans' understanding of western expansion is obtained from movies set in the west starring John Wayne?

If you believe that being lynched, shot, raped, starved, or otherwise terrorized by roving bands of thieves or railroad-hired thugs is romantic, well then, I stand corrected.

"Good post.

US investment from major corporations is pouring in, trying to get a cut. China is determined to be THE major world economic player, and they think they can do it without military intervention, with money and diplomacy alone. Russia is on board with the Silk Road deal, since it would skirt their own territories which are now poorly served. The US is losing big time, aside from our private commercial investments.

"""the racist Civil War general Robert E. Lee"" is a historically inaccurate portrayal.  Robert E. Lee was actually from the south but not for slavery but believed in the rights of States. He was widely respected by both sides for his treatment of prisoners and African Americans. 
  
If you look back and judge people by today's standards then even Abraham Lincoln who wrote before he won the Presidency that African Americans were inferior would be considered racists.  

No doubt a tough issue. Racism is a curse.  But how we treat and judge historical figures has to be tempered with and placed in context within the values of the day and whether they help progress the world to the values we agree on in today's world."
"The hype and media induced hysteria over the very small number of deaths by officers puts everyone at risk. All this for eyeballs and ratings.

"Sure there is plenty to celebrate. Nova Scotia has blacks that can trace their ancestory back more generations than most Canadians. There is record of black people fighting on our side during the War of 1812. Blacks were in Toronto and essential to passenger train service prior to the second world war. Carry forward and see the accomplishments of many blacks, for instance Lincoln Alexander and then just recently with a black woman on a new bank note.  

Ignore the lefties and celebrate. There are many, many black people for us to be proud of!"

The MPC is not racially representative, as you wish for - Blacks and Indians are disproprotionately over-represented.

Could you also please produce some original ideas of your own, instead of quoting quite irrelevant quotations from the likes of Fanon.

How about explaining what kind of detailed monetary policy it is that you want and showing how that would grow the economy, curb inflation, increase investment and reduce debt:GDP.
You could even share with us your Econometric modelling - I would be happy to critique it.

Zero or very low interest rates whilst inflation is around 7%? Explain what effect that would have on the economy in the medium and long term."

"Our first obligation is to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness. 

What would you tell someone in the antebellum South who said their conscience told them blacks weren't people and that it was their right to own slaves?  Would you still say our first obligation is to respect the conscience of others? Why or why not?

The unborn have immortal souls, but so does everyone else.  It doesn't make killing the already born morally justifiable.

So much of this mistaken autonomy of conscience that the CCC speaks of can be boiled down to, ""I decide for myself what is good and evil."""

You really would expect them to accept responsibility and apologise."

"“human dignity has no nationality”? This whole piece should ended with “for blacks” instead of “not discrimination”. A Nigerian comes to South Africa, applies for asylum or citizenship and gets it. The Nigerian becomes a Naturalized black South African. Nothing wrong with that right? Consider that this Nigerian will now get to vote, all the perks of a South African, he will get a job first and even have first option on tenders and business opportunities, his children will have first option to bursaries, sponsorship and even university accommodation and so on before any South African minority group. Not only will these immigrants help the ANC stay in power but they will help further economically side-lining minority groups. This is of course if minority groups aren’t exterminated by criminals and “normal crime” beforehand of course. This is why the ANC will welcome immigrants. This is only one of many strategies enforced by the ANC. If this isn’t a message, then I don’t know what is."
"Nobody is making the argument that the players don't have the right to kneel. I haven't seen or heard that at all. They're arguing that their boss should fire them for disrespecting millions of the people whose money pays their salaries. Like when the owner of Chick-fil-A said he thought marriage was a man plus woman type deal. Or the owner of Hobby Lobby said something to the same effect. Or someone didn't want to make a gay wedding cake. Or said something off color on Facebook. Or wanted to speak his or her political opinions at Berkeley, they wanted his book deal taken away. Now that you mention it, it appears that the Left is a tad jealous that someone is using their go-to tactic and it's working. 

Odd that a bunch of racists would idolize and buy and wear the jerseys of black players in a sport that is 70% comprised of blacks. Just a thought here, but maybe they disagree with the claims concerning the police made by groups like BLM. Maybe there are some numbers that support this."

Our country has been going about the drug epidemic all wrong incarceration and policing does not improve the drug problem in fact it has shown to make things worse look at the mass incarceration of young black males in the 90's because of our ""WAR ON DRUGS"".Throwing money at the justice system does not help either. I think we need to understand addiction. It is a BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL disease meaning it cant be attacked one way there is a lot of factors that have to be considered. Portugal has decriminalized drug use and treats addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice issue and it has shown to reduce drug use and drug deaths.
If it is a tax payer cost issue then all research show treating addiction as a public health issue is the most cost effective way."

"Ok, this has to stop! Why in a country that we are Free to believe what we want is this such a story? The President has stated his position and that should be the end of it. Whether we agree or disagree in this country people have the Freedom to believe what they choose, others may not like it but as long as no one is forcing thier beliefs upon you they have that Right. You can condemn the offensive beliefs but then let it go and rise above it and go on. I for one do not like these racist radicals nor do I like the Black lives Matter radicals, but my opinion is just that , My opinion. This tragedy could have been avoided if one of two things had happened, one- the permit to protest was not issued or two - the law enforcment divided the groups not ordered to stand down. We live in a Free Country, please quit trying to remove the history of our country , it is important, good bad or indifferent. As a society the mistakes of the past are important reminders of who we are today."

"Access to affordable electricity is written into the constitution, as is housing, so authorities are forced to comply and provide services to all, even though they may not recoup the cost of doing so anytime soon in the poorer areas. But to charge wealthy people more for the same service is not a solution, but just a shifting of responsibility that will create other problems downstream.

Far better to establish a cost + small % rate, limited to say R200 and give that free to every household  (no matter what your income or area), and increase it exponentially according to usage. Rich households will obviously spend more, and poor households will try and stay within the minimum. The City did this with water, and it worked rather well. 

To base it on the value of your property is just plain lazy, because you are not taking all factors into consideration."

Part of the unspoken problem is that black youth put these talented (but largely under educated) athletes on a pedestal.  They are the last people black youth should be striving to emulate.
Excellent article.  So glad to see Sec. DeVoss and Ms. Jackson of OCR taking a look at this mess and hopefully bringing some common sense and reason back.  Our colleges have become cesspools of progressive liberal agendas and this is one of the results.

"It would be interesting to see if more progress would be made if the protest was framed as ""cops harm/shoot/kill too many citizens"" rather than ""cops harm/shoot/kill too may African-Americans"".

No doubt the problem is worse for African-Americans.  But it's a problem for other groups too (particularly men of all races).  If it wasn't framed so much as a racial thing, I think it would attract far more support.  And the benefits would still flow disproportionately to African-Americans.

I think it is an unfortunate commentary that people are unwilling to stand up to anti-black racism.  But from a purely tactical point of view, I think downplaying race would result in more progress on the issue."
"Well, *someone* seems awfully upset that this stupid thing didn't pass. When are you guys going to figure out that ACA is not the terrible thing you think it is just because it is associated with the black President?

I dont know if excluding uniformed officers from the parade was the right thing, any kind of exclusion makes me uncomfortable; nonetheless, if I'd had been beaten to a pulp by a cop in a back alley, then had him/her lie about it in court, been carded innumerable times for just walking down the street, had my head slammed into the back of one their cars, etc. etc. etc.  yeah, I wouldnt want to be partying with them either...so back to the question WHOSE party is it?"

"Other significant differences that mitigate against a Mugabe style ""coup"" in South Africa has to do with historical roots.  

1. Zimbabwe has only one major urban conurbation; Harare ( population: 1.5m).  
South Africa has Cape Town (3.7m), Port Elizabeth/George (1.5m), Durban/Pinetown (3.4m), Johannesburg (4.4m), Tshwane (2.9m) and Ekurhuleni (3.2m).   
And 4 of these major South African metro areas are NOT ruled by the SACPanc.

2. The Shonas are dominant and make up 70% of the Zimbabwe population.  In South Africa 23% speak Zulu, 16% Xhosa, 14% Afrikaans and 10% English as their ""home"" language, in total only 63%; this represents a very diverse tribal/cultural landscape, in comparison to Zimbabwe. These tribal/cultural groups are also concentrated along historical lines across 9 provinces (one of which is not ruled by the SACPanc) and the 4 major urban conurbations."

And there are “poorly educated” Americans who abundantly express kindness and solidarity for Americans unlike themselves. Neither the elites nor the masses have a monopoly on qualities of character.

"I have mixed feelings about this. My first thought is that it's not a big deal to me if someone wants to kneel, whether it's Kap or Tebow. Seems like an overreaction by the fans and media. I'm a veteran and my response is a solid ""so what?""

But football IS a big business, kneeling is going to be divisive, and it's going to hurt the business that provides so much income to so many players and cause long lasting damage to the fan base when the NFL and the teams aren't the ones contributing to the issue. So why punish their colleagues and team owners by damaging the business that isn't involved? It's not a concussion protest. 

Players would do a lot more to the cause by working with police departments around the country, talking, donating time, or protesting on their own time. I'm just not sure how riling up the football fans helps prevent excessive force by the police on black Americans. There may be better, more productive ways of bringing attention to the issue."
">>Yet in the face of that disturbing evidence,

Okay, let's work through your proposal for comparison.

The retired atheist professor turns to the Jewish fellow and says: ""With those names in charge of things, aren't you nervous about the showers?""

The retired atheist professor has spent the last 40 years writing textbooks in support of civil rights for Blacks in America, documenting racist attacks and discrimination against Black folks there.

So, Lex, do you want that professor fired?"

The republicans have had everything in their favor to repeal or replace and they have produced nothing that even their majority can agree on, it is a travesty of greed, self-service and vitriol against a black president; if the plan was good they could have passed it by virtue of majority and the special rule they made for themselves. This is how poorly the republicans design, and execute their policies. The ACA is a good change, it could have been better if the republicans hadn't messed it up and luckily we have senators like Michael Bennet, who actually seek what is best for the American people."
"Why do Canadian Federal Governments think that Canadian taxpayer monies aren't for the betterment of Canadians.  I abhor the fact that taxpayer money can be freely tossed around on anyone but Canadians, without so much as a ""do you mind if we take your hard-earned money and give it away?"" Look around, J. Trudeau, our country is falling apart...not because people don't work hard enough, but because our government works even harder to take more money out of our pocket and give it away to foreign countries.  Why are the Canadian people putting up with this robbery?  You were only voted in because we saw no other option.  Better keep your bags packed because Canadians are fed up with this scene.  You promised CHANGE and SUNNY WAYS but what we are seeing from you are the same inside games that the CONS gave us for a decade."
"Rick, it is not spin, it is fact. As far as the idea that we have to make special dispensation for anyone who has been historically discriminated against due to whatever reason, we would be forever doing that for almost every ethnic group, from the Irish and Italians to the blacks and Asians. I prefer that all people be treated equally in every endeavor without regard to color, creed, religion or any other quality that defines anyone. Lastly, the republican party is NOT the party of racism and racists anymore than the current democratic party is. I do not think that highlight a persons race, ethnicity, background helps the situation because when you bestow special dispensation to one group, many of the other groups resent it and makes the situation worse. That is human nature, something that we all have to recognize and deal with logically. As a very smart person told me once, approach determines response. I should not have to explain that idea."
"Statistics and facts are not your friend if you are into the all black deaths are because of the police, mindset.  

The FBI statistics in particular show who is actually killing the blacks.  

Their assertion that blacks are convicted more often just because they are black ignores how many blacks are repeat offenders and how often their crime victims are also black."
Rosa Park was a true heroine because she was able achieve her goal without disrespecting the flag and country. Something Kap might have thought about doing instead of wearing those cops are pigs socks. Oh yea and that Black Power fist in the air thing doesn't fit well with many people.
"Madam, 
You cannot claim to despair of the future of journalism in this country if you rate eye witness accounts (notoriously unreliable) and anecdote....above a video recording.

I have also seen said full video and can state
1. BOTH children were girls.
2. The black girl is barely more than a toddler. Watching that man grab her (the action that catapulted the mum into a state of salivating rage) cut me deep, and I am not even a parent yet.
3. Violence against women and children should NEVER be tolerated.

This didn't become about race because the woman said so. It became racial because we opted to blind ourselves to the truth, believing ""witness accounts"" over visual recording. Perhaps Spur faked the video? How else do we explain this discrepancy, if not a double standard driven by our own secret prejudices? 

Actions always sleak louder than words."
Didn’t this mudshark and her nigger get killed by another nigger in a high drug area?? They were probably going to buy drugs. Oh well no big loss.
"How about racists who believe blacks are inferior and they should not mingle with them? Can florists, musicians and bakers refuse service to blacks?

SOrry, but you might not be aware that ""racists"" are not a protected class. And that's a good thing.

It looks like your prior reply to me was removed but no, I engage in no revisionism. Democrats booted the Klan -- this is a matter of historical record -- and the GOP welcomed them -- also a matter of record. This stuff actually happened. That makes you the revisionist in denying it."
Could it also include the possible progression: first a black President....then a woman.... My gawd the possibility of a black-woman-President?
"The US has freedom of speech too, but that is a freedom from GOVERNMENT persecution. Private employers can and DO enforce rules that include what players can and cannot say. The NFL rules require players to stand for the anthem and to not talk. The NFL has prevented past political actions such as the Cowboy's attempt to protes the killing of 5 Dallas Cops by a Black Supremacist. The NFL seems to turn the other way to leftist protest though."
"We have a crazy man who should never have had access to deadly weapons. He was motivated by an irrational animosity towards Republicans, it seems. That's this week's target. It could as easily have been Muslims, or Christians, or gays, or women, or co-workers (as just happened in San Francisco within the last few hours), or people of colour, or just innocent Americans going about their daily lives. The targetted groups are endless.

The common denominator is an inability to control access to guns in a way that adequately protects the American people."
"The left and the right are made up of individuals---some are intolerant and others are not.  One liberal does not represent all liberals, anymore than one black represents all blacks, one woman represents all women, etc.  Perhaps you should examine why you are so comfortable putting people in boxes instead of judging their words as individuals."
"linda hamilton. you don't like blacks, you don't like gays.. who do you like?"
"Palin only accomplishment was to lead the Tea Party to take the House, the Senate, and the Presidency, in eight years.  Which is far more that the Occupy Homeless Street, Black Lies Matter, Women Suffrage, and Prohibition all did combined.  

She makes Hillary Clinton look like a footnote in historical trivia."
"What nonsense. The ""all lives matter"" meme attempts to communicate that black lives are not the only lives that matter - nothing else. It has nothing to do with homelessness, or global warming, or other important but unrelated issues. You seem to be preaching that as long as there is any injustice in the world, nothing should be done about anything else."
You can read stuff like that in the Old Testament; that's why Christ reformed all that hogwash.
"Trump disparaged all POWs by disrespecting McCain's service in Vietnam. During the campaign he held a fundraiser for Vets but kept the money until the Washington Post shamed him into donating it months after the event. He assailed the character of a Gold-Star family who had the temerity to point out that Trump's proposed Muslim ban was unconstitutional and un-American. He still hasn't addressed the deaths of the four troopers killed in Niger and refused to release a generic statement of sympathy that was drafted for him in the days after the event. He promised a Gold Star father $25,000 and forgot the mail the check until it became public. He lied when he said he had called the families of every service member killed under his watch. 

He has never accepted responsibility for any of this. And you support him.

So tell us more about how the liberals are leading the, ""devolution from a rational society to and (sic) irrational me-first society."""
"I didn't see Linda Cohen and Rush Limbaugh's name of those who ESPN, has disciplined. Cohen was suspended because she commented that ESPN was being to political, for a sport network. And Limbaugh resigned from Count Down, same years ago, for criticizing the media for protecting black quarterbacks, from criticism. A media that told us it was racism to criticize a black president years later.

On CNN last week another black female sport report, Pam Oliver, said Hill was just expressing an individual point of view. Well isn't that what Cohen and Limbaugh did, or everyone of those mentioned in the piece, that either got them fired, suspended, or who resigned.  It's been reported ESPN lost a billion dollars, because of cancellation, and it appear Disney doesn't get it. Sport used to be a escape from daily life, however ESPEN has brought daily life to a Sports channel."
"Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do.

Video of the protests showed very few blacks and no dress noticeable muslims.
Clinton got 95 % of the black female vote and 68 % of the latino.

Its telling that these two groups were not significant participants in these protest marches.
Visual parsing shows that these were predominantly upper class females who could afford to travel to Washington where Trump only got 4 % of the vote.

Another very telling statistic.
Trump got  42 % of the female vote compared to Clinton at 54 %.

This is a typical gender based expectation.
But, among while female votes, Trump got 58 %.

These stats show that these protests were exclusively from the Democrat/ liberal elites.
This group has done very well under Obama,( doubling their share of national wealth )  with the lower 50 % being left with most of the debt .

Which is why Trump got elected"
"If the demands of Ndifuna Ukwazi don't make sense, it's because they don't make sense. This organization is an ANC front, serving a dual agenda: - 1) embarrass the DA administration of the W. Cape (which is open to embarrassment because of its socialist agenda + futile efforts to persuade black voters in the province) and 2) appease the Muslims in Cape Town by frustrating the efforts of a Jewish educational institution willing to pay top dollar for a property in Sea Point to operate as a school and cultural centre.

Whatever efforts the City makes towards affordable housing will never satisfy the agenda of the venomous Ndifuna Ukwazi. Best treat them as the facists that they are."
"It is amazing how stupid and cowardly tancredo is and he got elected several times.
He was a draft dodger.
He knowingly hired illegals.
Even when pointed out that he had illegals, he did nothing to stop it.
Now, he thinks that first amendment applies to his wanting to force a company to hire a group that is about racism ( the illegal aliens is a front since they only care about Latinos, and blacks ).

Have to say, that I hope he runs on constitutional or even the Nazi party. Both are applicable to him."
"You are wrong.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States

See specifically the segments on Native Americans, Black slaveholders, Intertribal slaveholders, Barbary pirates, and asian slavery.  

That ignored the virtual slavery of indentured servitude and servitude imposed as the condition of a criminal conviction. Everyone even slaves had rights (of one sort or another) and depending upon the area of the country those rights varied significantly (see NEW ORLEANS)"
"Obama took the S&P 500 from 700 to 2300 .............

"Despite the largely military audience immediately standing to show the proper respect for the lowering of the flag, Commander in Briefs Trump did not stand and show respect for the flag or for the military tradition.
He surrounds himself with actual military men, he boasts of 'doing the military so well your head will spin', but through his own actions and inactions, he disrespects the American flag and cherished military tradition while on base acting as Commander of the Armed Forces.
Wait for the outrage.
(…there won't be any, …there isn't a black target to point to here,
...just Trump, and he can murder America in the street and his followers won't care.)"
"Okay, I didn't read the entire essay.  I stopped about half way through when it became clear to me that her father raised her as a ""black person"" rather than as a ""person"", and imbued in her a racial tension that prevents her from ""fitting in"".

Over the years, I have worked with people of many ethnic origins, all having the quality that they didn't see themselves as of any particular ethnicity.  From the inside looking out, I can't see myself, just as they couldn't see themselves.  It was this attitude that made us compatible co-workers.  In fact, this essay had me to consciously recall my former co-workers, to recall what they even looked like to see if they fit the label of ""ethnically diverse"".

I suggest that this author try to wind back the clock to the 4-year age and start over.  The way we act influences the way people react."
Ernie Black = Seattle troll.
Lebrun James is disgusting! I used to like him but he stumped for HRC the biggest most corrupt politician to EVER run and called blacks SUPER OREDATORS and he trashes Trump?? I quit watching NBA because of him and the Seattle Seahawks version of the NBA-GS Warriors! They're friggn racists and I'm DONE! Only college football for me until......let's unite and boycott the NFL/NBA!!! ESPN is dying too thank the lord.....RACIST LIBTARDS
The Black Nationalist flag was flown by some at the rioting in Charlottesville.
You might ask Ken about all the screwed up projects he was involved in that cost the state billions - like calling the kettle black.
"Pardon my refusal to accept your authoritarian method of declaring victory.  This is a discussion, not a sports game with ever changing rules.
You made an interesting assertion here; you equate people whose ancestors were enslaved and have been subject to extensive discrimination by government to people who are participating in an activity.  Even if a person is homosexual, they are demonstrating that by conducting an activity in private.  They are not the equivalent to someone born with black skin and this continuing effort to equate the two is not reasonable.  I defend the right of people to engage in freedom of association, including same-sex marriage, if they choose to do so.  Note there is no requirement for such people to be homosexual; people can choose to marry for whatever reason they choose, including to provide benefits for each other if they want.  After 10 years, a person is entitled to Social Security survivor's benefits, a significant benefit."
"OK.  The slogan ""black lives matter"" is used to remind non-black people in the US that black lives matter just as much as any other lives.  Historically, in our country, we have chosen to devalue the lives of black people.  Responding to that slogan by saying that ""all lives matter"" (which is true, and what the BLM movement is trying to underscore) is, in essence denying the premise that the lives of black people are just as precious as the lives of anyone else.  
I don't understand why some find that slogan so offensive.  Why would the response not be: ""of course, they do, and we will do everything that we can to ensure that the lives of black people are accorded the same value as the lives of all others.""?"
"""Historically, this has been women, Jews, blacks, Hispanics and LGBT.""

And Catholics, too! As historian John McGreevy points out in his latest book, AMERICAN JESUITS AND THE WORLD (Princeton University Press, 2016): The Republican Party's anti-slavery program was coupled with an anti-Catholic one. The KKK targeted three groups, especially in the South: Blacks, Jews and Catholics. Can one forget Lyman Beecher's son, Edward, a well known educator and abolitionist, who, like his father, used to weekly sermon to warn his listeners of a Catholic conspiracy and one time even donated 4,000 dollars to fight ""popery.""  One of his anti-Catholic talks led to a crowd to burn down Boston's Ursuline Convent, with the local fire dept. refusing to respond to put out the fire."
"Top 10 racist Limbaugh quotes (continued)

[To an African American female caller]: “Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.”

“I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well.  They’re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well.  I think there’s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn’t deserve.” 

Limbaugh’s many attacks on Obama.....as a ‘halfrican American’, ‘Barack the Magic Negro’ 

“We need segregated buses… This is Obama’s America.”

“Obama’s entire economic program is reparations.”"
Kristi - I'm not sure where you read that I only think blacks are mistreated in my post? But Minorities are killed by police at a much higher rates in this country. Yes it is a racial issue and I don't know how you could skirt that when looking at the numbers.
"Native Americans held black people as slaves. My alleged great grandmother was taken as a slave-wife to a chief. One ancestor tried to defend a Protestant leader from the Inquisition of Charles von Habsburg who conquered the Aztecs. My Huguenot ancestors fled to America from the Catholics. Black Americans were drawn to Moses - the Abolitionist. I have proven Jesus was an Abolitionist who began the War of Liberation from Pagan Rome, thus, Pagans owned millions of slaves.  Judaism is a tribal religion that came out of pagan India. The days of the week are named after pagans. When the Jews lost the world war with the Roman Slave Master, Christianity was altered to appeal to Roman Pagans.  Did black slaves adopt the religion of their Native slave masters? http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/04/09/5-native-american-communities-who-owned-africans-slaves/"
Malcolm X.  Actually saved lots of black men in prison.
If the issue was black CEOs then he wouldn't have been on the council in the first place.  Race baiting has simply gone completely overboard.
"""This is why the distinction between Catholics and secularists is relative. Secular people are not a rigid block.""

if you create an anti-denomination of Secularists, you cannot act as if all secular people belong to it. You have to treat it as the small, minuscule group that it is, and treat it accordingly. They are not a threat to our civilization until we give hem power beyond their numbers."
"Since, as far as I know, NO gun comes off the assembly line earmarked for the criminal market, or the black market, or for criminal's friends and relatives who will transfer that weapon, I will stand by my original contention:  All guns in the hands of criminals or felons or fugitives have passed through the hands of ""law abiding gun owners""."
"Charles:  I agree with you.  I'm interested in your opinion regarding ""forgiveness"" in this incident.  I don't feel Ms Shurtz had malicious intent.  As I read her C.V., she seems a very decent person.  Posts from former students support this as well.  I've also read her comments and her apology.  You're an African American and you, not me, have been directly insulted my her actions.  How do you feel about forgiveness for Ms Shurtz's actions?  Thanks, Gary"
"Yup, cause black men never deal with stereo types about having too many children."
"I've probably read more news articles about the Trayvon Martin case than you have, Craig.  Martin was unarmed and walking home when he was killed.  His shooter stereotyped him all because he was black, out after dark, and wearing a hoodie.  End of story.  I feel sorry for anyone that's gunned down in cold blood; even if it happened to you, I'd have some sort of empathy."
"This has nothing to do with Canada.

Muslims import their sectarian violence into Canada. It was a born-Muslim Moroccan and a new convert attacked the Mosque.

"" ... Suspects identified as Mohamed El Khadir and Alexandre Bissonnette, according to court officials ..""

Islam, once a religion of peace, has become a mental sickness today. It has descended into sectarianism where the majority sect is excommunicating  anyone who does not agree with it, leading into senseless violence and terror.

Trump may not have any solutions, he has identified the problem alright. This attack is one more reason to keep them out. There are too many of them already. Do we want more of these guys here?"
"Unfortunately for Trump, Rudy Giuliani, a vicious racist himself, exposed the dishonesty behind the White House's claim that the travel ban is not religiously biased when he came out and described how the White House had come to him for help in disguising a Muslim ban as something else. The argument that the ban couldn't be anti-Muslim because it doesn't cover all Muslim countries is as absurd as saying that Giuliani, as mayor of NYC, wasn't biased against African-Americans because he didn't discriminate against African-Americans in Los Angeles too."
"Nothing of what you claim is in my post.  Nothing.  A black person is obviously black to all casual observers.  Not always, but the vast majority of the time.  This fact does not apply to homosexual people.  When a bisexual person engages in homosexual activity, does this make them homosexual or do they continue to be bi?  My point is that, really, it is none of my, nor your, business.  Unless you observe the activity, or if they proclaim their sexual preferences, you have no way of discriminating against the person.  Black Americans do not have this ability to hide their status."
America's 1/3 black president was all President Trrunp needed to get elected.
"Liberals got women the right to vote. Liberals got African Americans the right to vote. Liberals created social security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. Liberals ended segregation. Liberals passed the civil Rights act & the voting rights act. Liberals created medicare. Liberals  passed the clean air act and the clean water act. 

What did conservatives do?!
They opposed every one of those programs... Every One!"
"""Your country? How came it yours? Before the Pilgrims landed we were here.

"Obama certainly made some mistakes, but if you can't see how the right pushed division at every single opportunity you really haven't been paying attention.  They couldn't handle that he had won and did everything they could do to delegitimize him and to convince people that he was at fault.  What it comes down to, and it took me a long time to realize this, but ultimately it came down to Obama being a black guy.  Oh, the right in general couched their racism in dog whistles, but in the end they did everything they could do to divide this county. Their media machine, embodied in talk radio and the internet kept up a constant drumbeat of propaganda that talked about how Obama isn't a ""Real American"" or how he is a secret Muslim, or whatever crazy theory they could push."
True. It doesn't talk about the black UN helicopters who are taking over the USA. It also doesn't advocate that the Earth is 6000 years old.

"Good post.  My deep and long American history also includes adoptions, and was highlighted greatly to our family last year when my father did a genetic spit test : our previously 'english' heritage really was more German, along with eastern european jew and 'iberian peninsula'.  Why did we 'forget' our 'shameful' German backgrounds, easy :  WWI and WWII we served here for the USA.  Why was our darker skin 'iberian' forgotten : my family was full of racists, plain and simple.  Just watching an NFL game with my grandfather who I loved dearly, was sometimes very painful when he would go on and on about blacks who he did not call black but every derogatory name in the book.

America is a great place to be, freedom and liberty are here to stay.  It only took 2 generations to wipe out religion in our family, and as many generations to wipe out our racist points of view for at least some of us ... we are truly mixing pot Americans, and I wouldn't have it any other way.  USA! USA! USA!"

"This issue is ultimately about legally creating a third gender or class of human beings. Males, Females and Transgender-gay. Federal signs concretizing this law for bathrooms have already been created. The man, the woman (skirt) and the transgender half-skirt. This illusion has been achieved by making gender synonymous with race. Gay equals black-brown or the minority of your choice-they are the same legal identity-victims of oppression. Gays/transgender are now allegedly a race of people. Therefore as a legal recognized race of people they are liberally entitled to special privileges and Laws protecting them-special financing-affirmative action-job preference and so on. I personally do not believe sex or sexual identity should be elevated to the level of race. I have no issues with anyone's sexual proclivities, identities or desires. The same laws protect all of us. I prefer that we are all Americans and not hyphenated-Americans. 
There is nothing exceptional about sexual identity."

Transgender bathrooms? Really?"
"Martin, has it occurred to you that the relative paucity of Islamic terror incidents in China may have something to do with the relative paucity of Chinese involvement in Muslim affairs?  They didn't start the Iraq war, they don't support Israel, and they didn't use political meddling to steal oil.

Furthermore, if the Chinese have achieved what you say they have.....what is the cost?  Political prisoners.  A muzzled media.  Slave labour.  Torture.  More executions than all other countries combined.  Harvesting the organs of political prisoners for sale on the black market.  No freedom of speech or freedom of assembly.

The human rights abuses are documented and horrific -- and an affront to Western values."
"Florida is rather conservative.... but if the hispanic and black communities can be supportive, it might be possible to defeat Scott.

"LG, this time we disagree just a little.  

In reading the plaque, the onus of responsibility seems to be on the police and firefighters, fostering, I think, more distrust & hatred of police.  No mention of the fact the firefighters feared for their lives from gunfire coming from inside the house. No mention the bombing was not halted by the mayor - a black man. No mention the police were there to serve warrants & make some arrests - and that the neighborhood had been complaining about the activities at the house.

A terrible tragedy.  No doubt of that. Eleven dead and 60+ homes damaged/destroyed. But the responsibility for the entirety of the situation is not strictly on the police and firefighters. Should there have been repercussions? Yes..and hopes that tactics for dealing with such confrontations revamped. But the plaque should reference somehow that BOTH sides had a part in this tragedy."
"Trump “might know that, at 16.9 per 100,000, the rate of firearm-related deaths for African Americans in 2014 is tragically and unacceptably high, but not indicative of a war zone where all black people are subject to being gunned down when they step out on their front porches in the morning…. He might know that, although racial disparities persist in mass incarceration, according to 2014 Justice Department data, 94 percent of black males aged 30-39 were not in prison.”

"Good for you Hugh for making this point.  Looking back at 150 years ago, it's hard for us moderns to comprehend that slavery was the biggest issue of the day by far, and Americans were split on it...that it divided Americans from the beginning..... that it  often crushed the bodies and minds of its victims...... that young women were raped to produce more slaves....and it took a war  with over 600,000 deaths to finally end it.
AND what it meant that Mathew  P.  Deady was considered  Oregon's strongest slavery advocate......and that had he prevailed, Oregon could have ended up on the side of the South with destructive internal Civil War, much like Missouri.   Thank God Deady's position  was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters.

AND yet-- in  his later judicial decisions he was often protective of minority rights, especially Chinese, and in his personal life he showed no racism, with both of his bailiffs being blacks, and of course he did so much for Oregon and the UO....

"How many people dressed up as another race - afro, Chinese warrior, as a French maid, or tranny and all flavors of races in-between available at any Costume Store?   One might even argue that anyone dressing up as a zombie is insulting to the deceased.  

This is an outrageous overreaction by the RG and social media and of all places, and especially the UofO, for displaying such prejudice against their own respected faculty.  

Just goes to show that even in this severely closed-minded town that contains less than 1% of black minority, could possess such bigotry to attempt defend something they are so out of touch and uneducated about in their fervor to be politically correct about something so ludicrous as and innocent as a Halloween costume.

"I don’t need any history lessons from a Progressive.  It would be tantamount to Bible Study from an atheist.  Conservative and Liberal means nothing when compared to Right and Wrong.
Democrats not only were the Party of Slavery in the 19th century but the Party of Jim Crow in the 20th Century.  Republicans passed the first Civil Rights Act under President Eisenhower.  Johnson needed Republican support because he didn’t have enough votes form his majority Democratic Party to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  None of these Civil Rights Laws would have been necessary except for Democrats obstructing the rights of Black Americans (Jim Crow Laws). 

Blaming the ACA on the Republicans is a lie. Just because Nixon, Romney and a Republican think-tank floated similar ideas around, the fact is, it needed to be passed into law. The majority Democrat Party forced it down America’s throat without one Republican vote.
Check out California’s unfunded mandates and long term debt. Dead men walking."
"He needs to realize two things.
1) As a buisness owner discrimination against someone's sexual orientation actually is in contradiction to the Equality Act and therefore is illegal. This was upheld by the State of Washington. So sure, open the door for lawsuits. I am sure that those lawyer expenses will do wonders on his expense ledgers
2) The freedom he has to practice his religion stops when he is trying to impose them upon others. He is providing a public service as a buisness owner. He losses the right to say he will refuse to serve anyone, based on that. 

He also needs to understand that individuals in the community can also ensure that others are made aware of his bigotry and refuse to  patronize his buisness.  And if it goes under, I would shed no tear. He can then enjoy explaining to his creditors why their investment went under. 

And for those that say he has a right to serve whomever. Replace gay with African American or Hispanic, and ask yourself does this sound bigoted?"
"Another bonafide Obama op-ed.  Oh the outrage by the black community.  As if this author or John Lewis  or even Van Jones of CNN speaks exclusively for the black community.  I have seen many black voters interviewed that voted for Trump including a business woman mother of three interviewed by Lestor Holt on NBC last night in Monroe, Michigan.  She said it was ""all about jobs and Trump even though he was a real estate businessman in New York took the time to come to Michigan and address that"".  She further said that the Democrats neglected to listen to the concerns of the average voter.  Van Jones' ""whitelash"" racial biased meltdown on election night, Lewis' illegitimate president statement and op-eds like this do little to bring Americans together, something this woman in Michigan told Holt is needed.....and jobs."
"You are right.

I cringe every time I speak with Indians and their use of racial slurs. Caste System is based on race, lighter skins higher castes, and dark skin lower castes. Caste or ""varna"" in Sanskrit means skin colour.

The Indians think they are more beautiful thus superior to East Asians who they call ""chapta"" or ""flats"" because of their not so deep faces.  No other neighbour - not Russia, not Pakistan, not Iran think of Chinese as ugly or inferior. The Chinese are well liked and respected in all Asia except India. 

This Indian arrogance will not serve them well. They were defeated once because  of underestimating their foes, and this will happen again. Racial superiority never works."
Trump did not say fire black athletes....he said fire the sobs who refuse to stand for the national anthem.  If many of them happen to be black it's not him being a racist.
"Altercation is unlikely as both vessels were in a known traffic corridor. Both are equipped with collision avoidance systems. 
Presuming the cargo vessel was in the lane, I'm left wondering if the navel vessel attempted to overtake the larger vessel; and came up short. The black boxes will have the answers to our question."
You failed to address my points. When will black Americans take responsibility for their conduct?

"The mindset change is required from every South African. I have predicted collapse an apocalypse for the last fifteen years. It has come and I am afraid. I was wrong. In the end it was not ""their fault"". The fault is mine. My own intransigence to change and accommodation of others brought this about. I stood on the sidelines and felt only schadenfreude. I am at the cusp of seeing the destruction of the enemy and I feel only trepidation. No joy. We are in trouble. The country is not ready. There is too much ""us"" and ""them"". In the end we are going to need each other to save this country. 

What we are asking of the ANC members, is to destroy their own party. They are damned if they do and damned if they don't. Getting rid of Zuma will destroy the ANC. If they don't they will lose the 2019 election. I think they will lose anyway, but I do not expect them to go quietly into the night. For many, it is a life and death issue. They will fight.

Quo Vadis? indeed."
Bunk.  Obama got elected by black privilege and George Soros.
"As a multi millionaire why the display of pychopathic disrespect. The Clinton presidency was reverse Robin Hood and 3 strikes your out mocks baseball fans with their sport used to justify mass jailing of afro Americans, then new wars all failures, then huge Christians disproportionate deaths in pro Zionist wars tearing up the Mid East. MaryAn40 has a concept of top hidden leaders revealing their plan. In times of rising poverty we see that Clinton represents psychopathic neo cons and the traitors and psychopathic Christian haters is common among those above 100 million net worth thus wars and austerity on till perhaps more police more regime violence."

"Thoughtful article which made me think. Hadiya is quite proud of her gifted intelligence but that does bring along some challenges. Being a couple of years younger than my classmates made it difficult for me to develop social skills and 60 years later I still see that in how I interact with others. I also have a gifted grandson who was reading at age 4 and was helping kids 2 grades ahead of him with their math. But he had real problems fitting in. For me, it was not until I was at the Masters level when I learned to keep scholastic achievements very quiet in order to fit in.

I can see that Hadiya has experienced subtle discrimination, both real and perceived. I would encourage her however not to spend too much time playing the poor little me card while other people of colour succeed. That has happened to blacks in the US where Latinos have caught and passed blacks in average income."
I am unsure how one disagrees with black letter law.
"The Bahamas issued a travel warning to the United States on Friday, cautioning its citizens about police violence in the country.

“The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Immigration has taken a note of the recent tensions in some American cities over shootings of young black males by police officers,” the statement read. “We wish to advise all Bahamians traveling to the US but especially to the affected cities to exercise appropriate caution generally. In particular young males are asked to exercise extreme caution in affected cities in their interactions with the police. Do not be confrontational and cooperate.”"
"How exactly will this change now ? re : black men were three times more likely to be street checked

Will Estate lawyers be checked out more now as well ? As a woman involved in the province's legal community out there, we've been following as a result of her hubby being an Executor in Ontario for the past 3 years hasn't answered 1 question by the Eldest brother since his father died & his sister claimed his Dad was sending cash to Nova Scotia for them to fix their roof while his was leaking.
Not sure if the statements of accounts includes an insurance claim to repair the Dad's house before being sold to the sister so she could open an Air B&B while the Nova Scotia couple bought an Ocean going sailboat in Toronto & sailed it back up the St Lawrence.
Yet apparently they claim in court that they knew nothing of a Grandmothers Trust fund that has disappeared after coaching the Dad thru a Divorce & major cash outlay to here as well when the Nova Scotia couple were responsible for a prenup?"
"In the negative stereotyping of blacks, the media are complicit. They mostly show us blacks in conflict with the law. There's more to black lives than that, but it's invisible in the media. Being wrongly suspected hurts, especially when it is the actions of a few which cause that suspicion. Instead of blaming the police for trying to do their job, blame the people whose behaviour damages the community's reputation. 
No one has proven a significant rate of false convictions. So the solution to disproportionate incarceration rates for some minorities is not less policing but less lawbreaking. Community activists should explore what is needed to help their brothers obey the laws."
"Good for you Looking for checking out the data.  If you've found the current population you know California is some 8% black, Washington 5% and Oregon 3%.  Cal is at about three million, Wash about a third of a million, and us just over 116,000.  Way up from 128  (0.24%) in 1860!

You ask: how did those blacks get here earlier  if it was against the law?   Good  question. The answer, the law was only casually enforced.  The law impacted but did not eliminate ""free Negroes"" coming here.  (think of our earlier Marijuana laws) Only Jacob Vanderpool was evicted while George Bush chose to move to Wash to be free of such laws..

As Nokes notes in ""Breaking Chains""  (good book you should read ) there were up to 50 slaves in Oregon, again in spite  of the anti-slavery laws.  Regarding the exclusion laws he states ""But while the exclusion laws were rarely enforced in Oregon, the tragic legacy of the laws  was that they discouraged blacks  from coming at all. (p 171)"
"And yet you keep supporting the party that has failed you miserably. You have been taught to blame the right wing citizens of this nation for all your woes. You are very good at the blame game, you are very good at looking at the past mistakes of the nation towards the blacks but you are blind to doing anything other then complaining about the past. How will that change anything? I will ask you again, other then throwing the race card and whining about the past, a past we cannot change, what are you doing to improve the situation for the inner cities? I can tell you what you have been doing wrong, continue supporting a party that has used the inner cities for votes without caring about improving their chances for a better life. Wake up Charles, quit being used."
Racist ?- Please explain how a monolithic sovereign majority population can be racist? Who made the word racist up?  A pinko-commie sociology professor? Can't you think for yourself man?
"LOL! Yes, of course, ""apartheid made them do it."" 

But seriously. The signs about the true nature of the ANC were there all along. Torture camps in Angola in which dissidents were murdered, cowardly bombs and terror tactics targeting mostly black civilians, and the parasitic elite, such as the Tambos, living it up in London and elsewhere in Europe. Once a terrorist crime family, always a terrorist crime family."
"Gays and LBGT represent , at best about 10% of the population. If surveyed I'm sure the vast majority of tax paying public would agree with the police union.
As for calling Black Lives Matter an anti-racist group , that's laughable . That's like calling ISIS 's and Al-Aquada's version of Islam , a religion of peace. 
There are hate mongers complaining that BLM is giving them a bad reputation."
I didn't know that black people were still being oppressed. Wasn't Kaepernick making millions of dollars before pulling this stunt that led to his current state of unemployment?
"My kids team played Weld Central (and beat them) last year. Their experience was similar to the Manual experience described above. The black players were called the N-word repeatedly and other racially-oriented slurs. 

Racial slurs on the field have been pretty typical when playing Eastern Plains teams. I'll be happy to provide a list if you'd like."
"I agree with Trump that John Lewis should pay more attention to his congressional district and tens of millions of African-Americans he purports to speak for,

  Lewis risked his life for civil rights 50 years ago, becoming an icon. But like other liberals, what has he done for anybody these last 50 years?
   Supporting corrupt unpopular oligarch, Hillary Clinton, for president was a big mistake. He and other elitist Democrats have only themselves to blame for Hillary losing the election. Elitist African-American organizations like the NAACP and the Black Caucus, along with tens of millions of other African-Americans, should have supported the highly popular, uncorrupted, progressive Bernie Samders.
   Tens of millions of blacks need a genuine progressive who believes in economic transformation, free university, free health care, and equality for all oppressed minorities, not the status quo Hillary or Obama.
   Furthermore, all the polls showed Sanders beating Trump by a wide margin."
What you fail to realize is that Donald Trump has hired and cut paychecks to more black latino gay lesbian and transgendered people than all previous presidents put together.
"Oh yeah, it's also been time for CD to sit down and shut up too!  You are the biggest hater and worst racists I have ever known. Now you also show yourself as a sell out of American pride and a disgrace, to your own race.  No where else in the  world have  Blacks found such richness, greatness and power, and YOU diss it. Pathetic!  Do you see those kneeling JOCKS?  they are MULTI-,millionaires, I'm paying them to play a GAME, and they are dissing our flag. Ingrates, rich bass terds , they are indeed ingrates, like CD. jerk"
"maybeinoregon, I know several of her coworkers.  She is the BAD APPLE and there are a majority  that do not like her because she has chosen to hide behind her ""BLACKFACE"" philosophy.............Lane County should have terminated her many years ago, and they have valid reasons to do so, HOWEVER,  Lane County is running SCARED because of all of the lawsuits.  The jury's here seem to award big sums of money when the word ""racism"", OR  "" profiling"" is mentioned.  

In 1997 she sued Marion County over a racial discrimination issue and was awarded $243,000.00.    In 2003 she  sued Lane County and was awarded $50,000.00.  In 2015 she filed ANOTHER racial lawsuit against Lane County, and THANK GOD, she lost that one.  There is a profile here, and it is that she is using her BLACK skin to sue.  

When she won her previous  lawsuits,  that gave BLACK people, ONE  BLACK eye.  Now with this latest lawsuit, she has given BLACK people, TWO BLACK eyes.  

I PRAY she loses this next lawsuit.

motley??"
"Oh really? I've had death threats leveled at me on other platforms by the right wing. Oh, and constant ""jokes"" about shoving people in ovens from the same. I know prominent journalists, etc., get death threats and threats of rape (if they are women), especially if they are Jewish, black, gay, trans, liberal, etc.


In the past, I used to use my real name on various media platforms, until I started getting cons posting my real home address and remarks about visiting my family. I've had butthurt cons look up where I work, call there, and try to get me fired. And all because they were schooled by someone smarter than them.


Unfortunately, those behaviors were BEFORE that idiot was installed in the WH by the EC, now making these awful deplorables think they are now (even more) entitled to such behaviors.


I have never seen anything like that from the left personally. If they do, I in no way condone such behavior, as it has no place in a modern liberal country such as ours."
"He was not on a 'no fly' list. Or found by a court to be mentally ill. And he passed the background check according to the FBI.
The almost ten year 'assault weapons ban' which ended in 1998 'had no statistical impact' on murders according to the FBI and DOJ. 
And first you have to define what an 'assault weapon' is. Just being a black rifle isn't it!
With 22,000 firearms aiming at one window? Each person with a single California-sized ten-round magazine? 220,000 bullets? 
.
.




Yeah, I think that would have done it!

If just one relative of each of the 550 victims shot back with a ten-round magazine, that would be 5,500 bullets impacting the shooter's area."
"In retrospect, signing Desmond to a $70m / 5 yr deal was a big mistake.  He and Cargo are the Rox 2 highest paid players and both are big disappointments for the Rox so far.  When Parra & Dahl return, where will Black play Desmond?  Not at 1B I hope.  Reynolds has earned his spot there and unlike Desmond, is a bargain for what they're paying him.  Cargo & Desmond could well become 2 of the highest pd utility / pinch hitters in MLB."
This guy is a black communist activist if you ask me.

"Well I can tell you with 100 percent certainty that I don't think he should be accountable for Milton Bradley being a complete nutjob, and yet that was your #1 go-to example of how he mismanaged the 2010 Padres. 

Black's W-L record as a manager is not very impressive, but I never felt he had a lot to work with in San Diego. I will grant you, however, that the Padres are no longer fading in September now that Black is no longer at the helm."
"I don't think they will make an US American be pope. 

I would be happy to see Cardinal Sarah ascend the chair of Peter...and Cardinal Kasper live long enough to kiss his ring after the despicable comments he made about African Catholics. 

I thought it was scandalous no one from the Ordinariates or Eastern rites where they have married men with families as priests seemed to have been asked to chime in at the Synod. 

I do think the contradictions inherent in the Kasper interpretation of AL will ultimately fall under the weight of their incoherence. Francis might go the rest of his life without answering, but the next pope will probably want to answer. God help us if they put in someone like Cardinal Tagle though!"
There were 2 pot-dealing black males [most likely members/affiliates/supporters of Black Lies Matter] from St. Louis who were arrested recently who planned to sell the guns to gang members.

"tRump created the anti-tRump rallies, March.  Every time he opens his clap-trap he manages to create a new ant-tRump faction.  Glen Beck interviewed a guest that strongly suggested that tRump needs to be assassinated to make room for another rise of Ted Cruz candidacy; and Beck agreed.  How do you like those apples?  It's not just the Mexicans, Hispanics, Latinos, and blacks that are anti-tRump it's a growing population that'll have their say in the voting booths; if tRump manages to make it to the RNC."
And let's not forget 100-year-old Strom Thurmond who was a racists all his life.  Thurmond took his racism so far and deep that he fathered a black daughter.
"Mr. Atkinson, I agree with your reply. Indeed, all changes for the better. However, the state has poured vast amounts of money into worthless projects like Port Mackenzie, the Anchorage fish processing plant , KABATA, the black hole port of Anchorage and more while making piecemeal improvements to the Seward Highway.  Half the population of Alaska drives on that dangerous outdated highway. A death today, two deaths a month later, another three months later. Individually they do not garner attention. Cumulatively it is outrageous yet tolerated by our citizens and politicians alike. It is not a traffic enforcement problem. The Autobahn in Germany allows three times the posted speed of the Seward Highway without the carnage.  Fundamentally, the problem is the Seward Highway is a two lane country road, with gawking tourists and people anxious to get to Seward and the Kenai. The highway operates at over capacity with an assortment of heavy, slow and fast vehicles of all shapes and sizes."
"Eastman was the only vote against a bill to honor Hmong and Lao veterans.

"It's pretty obvious you aren't that close then, let alone ""very close"". That you haven't been invited over should be your clue that maybe the ""close"" relationship you think you have is a one-way street and your ""very close friends"" may think you're an acquaintance at best. Maybe your ""very close friends"" don't really enjoy your company and accordingly do NOT want you in their house. Maybe your ""very close friends"" roll their eyes behind your back when you attempt to use them with this ""Some of My Best Friends Are Black"" routine like you're doing now."
"“I love America more than any other country in the world and, exactly for this reason, I insist on the right to criticize her perpetually.” (James Baldwin)

45 loves America but wouldnt fight for it - how many deferrals did he get again.  On the other hand black men and women throughout the history of U.S. has gone off to war to fight for freedoms they did/do not have in the country they were fighting for - not unlike FNs.  Ali lost his licence to box, was stripped of his titles, and stood out the best years of this boxing career when he said

“My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America.  And shoot them for what? They never called me ni**r, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father. … Shoot them for what? How can I shoot them poor people? Just take me to jail.”

45 spent his deferrals playing tennis."
"According to the followers of the Teleprompter Jesus™, two term Obama was persecuted just for being black while president, so it comes as no surprise that the biggest news of the day for the anti-Trumpers isn’t the $110 billion arms deal with the Saudis, but a glowing orb from a Harry Potter movie. Secretly, they’re just angry that Obama wasn’t invited to touch the Magic Muslim 8 ball, after he kissed their behinds."
"You nailed it: it is a cultural problem. Rather than a culture of aspiration and discipline, the black community has unfortunately become embroiled in a culture of victimhood and gangsterism. It does not value those in their community who are scholars and thinkers, or those who have families and work hard and obey the law. Instead, it worships gangsters, those who abuse and deride women. 

We have heard the same excuses, blaming this country of that country. The raw fact is Canada never had this as a problem just three decades ago. It is an imported problem. Europe never had this as a problem but it now does. More police and gun control laws will not solve it, nor will more social welfare payments. Only a cultural change and a mindset change will stop the violence."
"Competence is a relative concept. There was a time the British thought the Jews made lousy military material. In the last 70 years no one has defended that idea!

There was a time when it was assumed that African Americans would never be good at baseball (okay, I got that from the movie ""Look who is coming to dinner"").

There was a time when it was assumed the Japanese would never be a modern country, due to their Shinto beliefs.

There was a time that it was believed the Irish would always be a poor country because they were lazy and unintelligent. Today their per capita is much higher than that of the British."
Did the black slaves have guns in your made up world?
"""The civil rights movement triggered massive rioting by the blacks, followed by urban blight and rampant drug use all across the US during the 60s and 70s.""

Right, that's all the fault of African Americans seeking their rights as citizens of the USA.  They should have just kept with no ability to vote, drank from the other water fountains, put up with the occasional lynching and stayed in their place.  Quite the ""tell"" your statement there...."
"Upon further thought, I'll summarize my point for all:
The claim that Lincoln wanted to send all blacks to Central America is a ""NEO CONFEDERATE"", claim.  The link to the article provided repudiates that claim.  Mr. Harris, the author of this RG printed opinion piece bases his thinking, beliefs, and opinion piece on what could be called a racist (NEO CONFEDERATE) attempt to have Lincoln support their racist views.  The RG in its desire to publish anything ""racial"", didn't even bother to check out Harris' ""facts"".  This is what our current trend of shoddy racial academics and journalism has come to.  Besmirching the single most important figure in our nation's history to end slavery and put our nation on the path to racial harmony."
"I am tired of those two groups pushing their agendas. Pride - Gays and Lesbians have achieved much by being on centre stage for such a long time. It is time for some other worthy cause to be given attention. Canadian blacks have imported the anti-police mentality from the USA. Yes, we all must work to ensure there is no discrimination, as we also recognize the need for blacks to clean up their communities which are often high crime areas - in this we support them. But, baring police from showing support for any group is unacceptable and NO PUBLIC FUNDS should be spent on supporting the parade."

"You paint with a rather broad brush here. I had been critical of Hannity and Bolling and others who saw nothing but a halo around the Gilded Toad's head during this election. But, the workaday men and women, Blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, rich and poor who did vote for him were looking out for their own best interest, which is all any of us do when making choices. You totally discount that they also have minds and saw that the choices given were rather dire. They didn't pick your candidate.

I have relatives who voted before Hillary. To this day we still speak to each other. I look at them and think they were misguided, but not bad people. Unfortunately, the way I have been treated and characterized by Hillary supporters is that we are evil people AND I DID NOT EVEN VOTE FOR TRUMP.

A very broad brush indeed."
It did. Partly because he upset the wrong people and partly because he's lost his q b swagger.  But not because he's black.

All of them Americans.  
As to blacks fighting for the south, I refer you to search Google:  Walter Williams, professor at George Mason University, Syndicated columnist and nationally known speaker.  Oh, yeah...he's black.  There are many sources describing blacks fighting for the South, including the likes of Horace Greeley.  You appear to be deficient in your historical knowledge of the War of the Rebellion."

"You will get no argument from me, other than a request to apply perspective. Those that died on both sides of the SA colonialist project opposed each other in their objectives - an internecine warfare, no different to the 20000 who died in the Zimbabwe altercation between Mugabe and Nkomo in the 1980's, or the equivalent death toll in KZN between the Zulu's aligned to either the IFP or ANC leading up to 1994. 
The perspective to be applied is the scale and depth of the massacre of European Jews - a people who were unarmed and at war with no-one at the time. 
If anything, black South Africans should identify more strongly with the Jews, as we were once the 'kaffirs' of Europe, more closely aligned to their own vile treatment by the colonialist enterprise."

Writing in Mark will only dilute the vote and guarantee a win for Lisa just as happened last time when so many Alaskans running scared from Miller wrote in Murkowski's name rather than voting for Scott McAdams. Any moral purity vote for a third party presidential candidate with no hope of even breaking 15% will be a vote for the most undisciplined, boorish, misogynistic racist ever to become the candidate for a major political party. Get over your self righteousness and realize there is no choice in this election for women, people of color and people who think rather than emotionally react than Secretary of State/Senator Hillary Clinton. You have fallen for the anti Hillary propaganda but need to get over it. Keep in mind the sexpot Jessica toon character from Who Framed Roger Rabbit when she laments, ""I'm not bad it's just the way they drew me"""

"This comment isn't helpful at all, and the five people who gave you a thumbs up approve a shallow statement.  Says a lot about them.  You'd expect someone who welcomes defiance of the law to say more than ""Well, it's immoral,"" and let it go at that.  Comparing harboring laws to Jim Crow laws is ludicrous.  Any black who knows history would be insulted.  No wonder you lost --- no credibility.  Always playing the race card, while thinking shallow.  You either haven't thought out why the harbor statute is illegal or you chose not to take the time to express your self.  Either way, the appropriate icon is ""sad."""
"Are you trying to suggest that one person is representative of the views and positions of the left? Thanks for the laugh.

Also, learn something about black identity Christianity, maybe have some black friends you're close enough with to regularly have dinner in their homes, then you might be able to make an intelligent comment about Wright. The short of it is, bombastic comments are used to motivate people to overcome and succeed. Every black kid growing up had an uncle, grandfather, or pastor, who made such bombastic statements as a means to motivate them.

See, you can choose to try to understand people who are different than you, or you can use misunderstanding and ignorance to try to score political points. But which you choose reveals your own character."

"It may be that people from these groups (poor, black, Latino, elderly) do not have the same life experience that you do where they fly often or have checks to cash and have to do it in establishments where they are not well known (i.e neighborhood store) or hang out in bars where they are not immediately known by name.
Having to show a photo id for any normal daily activity would be a new requirement and they were never at risk before of having their identity challenged because their name changed when they married or were adopted.
The failure to accommodate all of these and other circumstances in people's lives that are not like yours is the design of the voter suppression that discriminates against poor, black, Latino and elderly voters."
"Agreed. Why the Honolulu Star-Advertiser and other news media are turning a blind eye to the glaring weakness in UH football is a head-scratcher. Someone needs to have the guts to just straight up ask Rolo the million dollar question: Is the defensive coordinator qualified for the job?

Take these assholes out behind the barn and BEAT THE CRAP out of them!!!! They will not be happy until they have completely OVERRUN our Nation.

"I was comparing the African culture of the 18th century with  that of American culture of the same time period.   No, I do not assume all black people are genetically pre-disposed to tribal violence.   It is however what has been going on in much of Africa for eons.    There are some areas in Africa that have gotten away from it, but it is still common."

"It would be great if we all could ""ignore"" race as a criteiron for discrimination.  Of course that is not the case.,  Racism is ""alive and well"" in America today.  Since the election of President Obama we've seen millions of internet posts attacking him with racist comments.  On a wider basis, the use of ""code"" words and references is widespread.  Additionally, it would be disingenuous to claim the far too frequent kilings of black men by police has absolutely no racial component.  

Racial identity and ethnic membership are real and we don't need to ""ignore"" them like they don't exist.  We do need to quit using them as the basis for discriminatory actions."
"Mainstream liberal media were all stunned by Trump's victory in spite of their unceasing and relentless demonizing of Trump as being a racist, a bigot, etc. etc.

It appears that mainstream liberal journalists can not accept a presidency of Donald Trump ergo this so-called ""racism"", one of the very thing to demonize Trump during the election campaign.

But on the question - Why did people vote for Trump

Simple:  
(1) Build the wall  
(2) Renegotiate trade agreements 
(3) Drain the Swamp.

Racism?  

How can one even think of racism when Trump intends to tackle low income African-Americans and Latinos in inner cities in his ""Make America Again"" programs."

Where in god's name are you coming from? Under George Bush you had a war for WMD that was all about hot air and financial crisis that almost tanked the global financial system.

"The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, usually identified as the National Council of Churches (NCC), is the largest ecumenical body in the United States.[1] NCC is an ecumenical partnership of 38 Christian faith groups in the United States. Its member communions include Mainline Protestant, Orthodox, African American, Evangelical, Josephite and historic peace churches. Together, they encompass more than 100,000 local congregations and 40 million adherents.[2] It began as the Federal Council of Churches in 1908, and expanded through merger with several other ecumenical organizations to become the National Council of Churches in 1950.[3]"
"Obama's legacy is that he was the first black US President.  Whoohoo!  Look, he got into Harvard on affirmative action, and basically became the President because of affirmative action.  It proves that the US is not a racist society, on the whole

As for policy and effectiveness, he was a total failure and leaves America more divided than at any time in the last 50 years.  On the global scene, the US is at its weakest position since the Carter years."
"""The two reasons given for the decline are the ordination of women and the blessing of same sex marriage,""  
All that proves is that those leaving the Episcopal Church aren't any more Christian than those responsible for policy in the Diocese of Madison. Just like the so-called Christians who think it's okay to hate black folks and to ignore the needs of the poor."
"I think you are confused.  The issue was not on how big the cake was, or its flavors or even its style.  The baker refused to make a cake for this couple ONLY because of the fact that the cake would be used as their wedding cake.  Thats it. And just so were clear, this baker had a shop. Its not like hes some freelance baker/artist doing this stuff on the side.

The FACT is, if a straight couple had sat down with this guy and asked for the exact same cake this couple wanted, this baker would have made it for them.  The ONLY reason he refused to make this cake for this couple was because he does not agree with gay marriage.  Really its no different than people in the 50's refusing to serve a black person.  Many people cited the Bible for their reasoning for that as well....didnt make it any more right.

Do you really want to live in a country where people can refuse to serve you just because they dont agree with your personal life? I sure don't."
I don't live in Toronto but I'd recommend the city just let that era to fade to black.
"Oh boy i saw this and knew some heads would explode, for some reason we seem to have a trust of people even on the assembly who cannot think critically. If so many people ""died"" for his right to freedom than does he not have right to practice that freedom without criticism? Is he hurting any one? You can only practice the "" freedoms I agree with""? Yeah thats what they told black people after slavery, ""hey your free"" but don't vote, or use this bathroom or try to hold offiice but hey your free"".  The same people pissing and moaning lossing there colective minds would be singing a totally different tune of he got up there and knelt in prayer. Right? Think about it."

"I took the time to explore the BLM official web page. There is some pretty incendiary language there ""BLM is an ideological and political intervention in a world where Black lives are SYSTEMATICALLY and INTENTIONALLY targeted for demise"". I don't know if the Dallas shooter or Minnesota rock throwers are inspired by this- but I certainly can see how such language could inspire violence."
"Hmm...pretty much everyone in my immediate family is some degree of 'black'.  They all act differently.  Wife speaks with a Jamaican accent when she isn't speaking Spanish.  Or Arabic.  I get bossed around in THREE languages.  Grandson acts like a Tyrannosaur, which is what he wants to be when he grows up, and much to the annoyance of my daughter.  I take full responsibility for that one.  My son and son-in-law both act like hardworking providers for their families.  How does one act 'black'?  Does one take acting lessons for it from Sidney Poitier?  Ah well, congratulations for one of the most inane posts in this thread so far.  And that's saying quite a bit."
John you are so racist!! Thugging around oh you say that because they are black... quit with the racism if you actually were educated about anything in particular this issue you would know that many of these players have foundations that help their communities!!

I'm a law abiding person and it ticks me off when one group gets away with looting and destroying property nearly every time they feel justice wasn't fair.  Why does only one group of Americans feel they are justified in mass looting and destruction of property every time things don't go their way ?  Why do you call me a name for stating the obvious ?  In New York Black Lives Matters people were chanting they wanted police killed.  Obama told the nation "" police acted stupidly "" in the D.C. case which was code for all police are bad or to be questioned.  He implied they weren't the hero's they are for keeping us safe. How does stealing TV's and everything else they can grab like a pack of rabid dogs ( have you seen the security tapes ? ) make up for a a court decision they disagree with ?  What do you call them ?"
"Before Obama manufactured all this racism 70% of all American's said race relations were good, now it's less than 40%, what happened in those 8 years? The great divider created a class of Black Racists like Black Lives Mater to further his Marxist agenda is what happened."
"""... including the growing number of religiously unaffiliated people — care about our internal battles over the fine points of theology? Close to zero. ""

I really don't care if one is protestant or Catholic, what is the use of your faith in God when you just rather keep silent about Christian raping God in children? 
  
Clergies are obstacle for me to worship God now.   I thought that someone has to teach children and the spiritual children the rudimental teachings of the spiritual truth.  
However, if I have children now, I would not send them anywhere near the clergies who rape children and the clergies who stand silent while the clergy sex abuses of children are going on!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Held for five years without trial.

People find the KKK repulsive, shall we detain people in jail who want to join it?
Some conservatives find Black Lives Matter repulsive. Shall we indefinitely detain people who want to join it?
Some liberals find the Tea Party repulsive. Shall we indefinitely detain people who want to join it?
So, we call something a terrorist organization, and we can detain people without trial?

Racial politics will still prevail at the next election, for this the IFP has a major role to play in convincing the rural electorate as a corrupt free and good governance alternative. The DA to embrace and exceed all the populist policies of the ANC. The DA must be viewed as an ANC but without the corruption and poor governance for it to be able to attract meaningful black vote. The public face of the DA needs to change completely.
In the current dire situation we are facing, for all the opposition parties to come together and jointly plan and execute a strategy to relieve the ANC of power."
"How wrong can you be? Christianity was widespread in the Sudan, by natural evangelism, not forced conversion by Europeans, in the 2C (recall the first ""militant"" Christianity occurred post-Constantine).

Christianity has almost as long a history in Africa, particularly east Africa, as it does in the M.E. There were entire Coptic Christian kingdoms for centuries. The only ""forcible conversions"" by ""outside invaders"" occurred when Arab religious imperialists exported Islam, at sword point, in the 7th century. Islam has been systematically oppressing and killing Christians, animists and other ""pagans, since then, with the West, for the most part, not helping them."

"Jibberish. Plain and simple. The nut job in Japan was released after being deemed no longer a threat and promptly went out and stabbed 15 disabled people to death. Hinckley is a nut job, lock him up and throw away the key.

"Lets try this again.  No I'm not saying the women had racist intent.  In the case of the 3 black athletes the woman was black as well.
I don't think race played a part in the evenings events at all.

Part of the public will make a presumption of guilt/innocence based on race.   A part of the public will make a presumption of guilt/innocence based on gender.  Do you doubt that?   

The police on the other hand based their actions on the evidence and found it insufficient to make a charge.  Did you read the report?"

"Maybe you would be happier getting your news over at the CBC website.

The CBC's top-of-the-page stories now are on wild foxes in Newfoundland and a push in Hamilton for better transit.

The UK attack is item number 7 in the list as you eye down from the top of the page.

Do you think the CBC would have had that kind of low prioritization if this had been in the USA with a murderous American right-wing militia group and with dozens of black folks as the victimized casualties?

The CBC's coverage was certainly prominent on events such as Trayvon Martin (Florida) and Michael Brown (Ferguson). Indeed, you can read Ferguson headlines in depth even days and months after the event at the CBC, such as ""Michael Brown shooting commemorated 1 year on"" and ""Michael Brown shooting and Ferguson aftermath timeline"" and ""Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson speaks about Michael Brown shooting"".

Canada's media does not under-report US gun events, they simply choose ones that fit a wanted narrative."

Sounds like Akima policy allows women to be fired but not male executives.  Quoting from the WaPo article Akima failed to fire a male director who violated company policy:
=====
As she was monitoring Facebook this summer, she found a public comment by a senior director at the company in an otherwise civil discussion by one of his employees about Black Lives Matter.

“You’re a f------ Libtard a------,” the director injected, using his profile that clearly and repeatedly identifies himself as an employee of the firm.

In fact, the person he aimed that comment at was so offended by the intrusion into the conversation and the coarse nature of it that he challenged the director on representing Akima that way.

So Briskman flagged the exchange to senior management.

Blacks want respect but cannot show any respect for the flag.
"It appears that the Knights are repudiating their vows and forfeiting their claim to be a religious order, in favor of their identity as a medieval military order.  Fair enough.  The pope should acknowledge that they are not a religious order; he should dispense them from their vows, or clarify that the vows have no ecclesial significance; he should withdraw their patron and all clergy attached to the Knights; he should exclude the Knights from participating as religious in liturgical celebrations; and he should suspend or withdraw diplomatic recognition while the Holy See and the Knights work out whether or how they relate to each other going forward. It appears that the Knights are a cult, not within the church, but opposed to it. Perhaps Cardinal Burke will find himself more at home in that cult than in the church."
"1) Nobody has told me the answer is 8 and certainly not you.
2) What exactly does ""otherwise"" cover in the law...does ""otherwise"" cover everything. If you think so...again you are wrong. Please stop telling me 4+4= 10
3) You told me two days ago the Baker cannot be compelled to make a political statement. I told you yesterday that a picture of the grand cyclops of the KKK IS NOT POLITICAL.
4) Anti-discrimination laws don't target speech, they target the act of discrimination against persons. There's a difference.""
Yes...there is.. that is why a black baker cannot discriminate against a skinhead who walks into his shop...like many of us have been telling you for about 36 hours. Try again Patrick.

"Mass muderers of any kind are a grievance.
We can jail them, but we cannot torture them, nor can we send them to another country knowing they would be tortured.

"It is surprising that, as a mixed race person who spends so much time thinking about her race, the author identifies as black.  Based on her own words, the author is as black as she is East Indian. Why doesn't she identify as mixed or simply identify as a person."
"I think that Neil Degrasse-Tyson had the best response to this kind of argument. He pointed out that when he was growing up, literally no one in his school or larger learning environment encouraged his interest in astrophysics. Instead, because he was black, his teachers kept pushing him towards sports. He was telling this story in response to a question about the lack of women in the sciences. The upshot of his response was to say that before people began making categorical statements about how people are biologically different, we need to know that social and environmental factors are really controlled for and are not decisively at play. That argument continues to apply here. It may be true that different kinds of biological factors affect the disposition and interests of men and women in general terms. However, we need to construct an environment that allows for individuals to make their own choices. Generalizing about groups of people discourages those exceptional individuals."
They tell stuff like that while aborting thousands of black babies.
"“I prefer someone who burns the flag and then wraps themselves up in the Constitution over someone who burns the Constitution and then wraps themselves up in the flag.”- Molly Ivins

I couldn't agree more. Our nation has never been perfect. If we are to continue our uneven progress towards our ideals, we simply must protest our failings, as we have done for generations - Civil War, unionization/worker rights, women's suffrage, civil rights, Stonewall/gay rights, free speech movement, anti-war movements, environmental movements and, lately, black lives matter. Sadly, most of these movements and protests are repeats of attempts to rectify our American Original Sin of slavery and racism. We're slowly, unevenly moving forward, but only because of people like these fine SEHS students. 

Bravo, and excellent response from the principal."
"Mote.  Beam.  You proceed according to the ""perception"" that a single pregame interview sums up this man's life, without any substantiation whatsoever.  Since I never watch TV except when it's beamed at me in airport lobbies, I have no opinion concerning said interview, but have seen too many such interviews of myself, family and friends chopped, spliced and rearranged such that the final footage made us appear to have said the exact opposite of what we actually said.  Reason my Iraqi brother-in-law stopped giving interviews at the start of ""Operation Devil's Storm"".

Having said that, what's fairly safe to conclude--whatever your claimed or real ""identity""--is that you don't feel vulnerable to the types of threats to which me and mine, and black American athletes, ARE vulnerable.  Do I find your identity ""interesting""?  Nah.  Irrelevant.  That's because I'm not a 'racist', in case you haven't figured that out."
"Another Liberal old world political hack not coming to terms with the people deciding that Washington's ""business as usual"" politicians had to go. Starting at the top.

"Ahhh - the irony.

There was a post election study of voting patterns between 2008, 2012 and 2016 showed that significant numbers the black community that voted for Obama simply stayed home in 2016. The proponents of Russian collusion would prefer that you did not read the assessment.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voters-who-stayed-home-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/

Bill Clinton did say of Obama in 2008: ""A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee.”  

I would wager that if you asked the average black American who was perceived as more racist, Trump or Clinton, the answer would be very close. But only because the media hits Trump much harder."

"Hugh -

You are criticizing slavery - the most severe racism.  We can all agree with that - especially as it applies to the history of much of the nation. 

But what part of  the kidnapping of blacks, the inhuman conditions afforded them, the murder carried out against them or their use as ""animals of pleasure"" was actually carried out against them here in Oregon - by the generation that created the University of Oregon and paid taxes and donated money and livestock to the building of Deady Hall? Or by the generation who, over thirty years after the Civil War, named the hall after Deady. 

The answer is not one one-hundredth of one per cent.

Instead, the majority of early Oregon voters made Oregon a free state and many went to war wearing Union blue."

I suspect it's easier to engage in hairsplitting about how Donnie is not exactly like Hitler or Mussolini, or what is different about right wing authoritarians that support Donnie vs. those that supported fascists of the past, rather than confronting what your party has become, and either working to FIX IT, or find another party to affiliate with - I think to ignore it is to put our country in peril, and so I won't ignore it, and I WILL NOT stop speaking plainly about it, no matter how politically incorrect you and others like you seem to find it.


BTW, many of the skinheads, Breitbarters and 4channers very much want those they consider the enemy (gays, blacks, Jews, Hispanic, Asian, non-xtians, union members, and ""liberals"" - meaning, anyone who does not give full throated support to their Idiot God, including ""cuckservatives"", to be subjected to the worst that the Third Reich had to offer."

"Thank you for this incredibly relevant post.  It is this vital point you raise (the passing of the NDAA of 2012) that consistently gets lost in this topic by Clarence Moriwaki, Tom Ikeda of Densho, and others.

Obama, with bipartisan and nearly unanimous support (including from then Congressman Jay Inslee), passed this law that allows the president on his say so alone... to have the military secretly arrest an American citizen or legal resident in America, without charge or trial, and secretly hold them in a black site prison anywhere in the world.... indefinitely.  No due process.

Yet Clarence, while quick to mention Trump and his fears, consistently praised Obama and Inslee (who he worked for as special assistant) with no detectable (that we can find) rebuke for what they did with the NDAA of 2012.  Obama even defended this unconstitutional power in court against the liberal plaintiffs Chris Hedges, Dr. Cornel West, Noam Chomsky, and Dan Ellsburg.

Why the silence?  Never again?"

"No I don't speak for black, I speak as someone who has watched the black families  being destroyed because of their victimization attitudes. I am speaking as an individual who has read about 70% of the black births are to single women. I have also read over 50% of the murders are being committed by 13% of the population (black population) of the country. I am speaking of the 27% unemployment rate of black youth. Each and every on these issues are somehow being blamed on ""Whitey"". Maybe it is time for the black community to look inwardly instead of blaming every thing on ""Whitey"""

"I command the author wrote this article but to me racism is racism and there is no lesser or ""casual"" form of it.  All I can say is living in Canada for many years as an ethnically Chinese person I did had my fair share of racism encounters and sometimes I did receive especially rude treatment and I tried not to think because it was due to me being a Chinese-looking person but I supposed it could be the reason as the author suggested.  Canadia often like to boast about being a multicultural and tolerant society but all of that is just hollow rhetoric when people of color still receive so much racism in society and that any suggestion racism is a serious problem in Canada would often met with such dismissive, angry or even more racist responses."

As long as Pride is willing to allow itself to be dictated to by the racist hooligans at Black Lives Matter, and shun a police presence because BLM is somehow against police, , then it does not deserve public funding of any sort.

How do you make that assumption when people with  guns are allowed to kill children and other humans.? How do you make that assumption when the US Government has propped up an illegal ISRAEL since 1948 as it seizes in a brutal fashion Palestinian land. Civilized countries leaders do not give $38 billion to ISRAEL for weapons to further oppress, terrorize the PALESTINIANS and neighbors.

Many blacks hate the cops for putting them down and killings while the same things can be said for why some cops are the same way.   When does the circle break?

Mr. Miller was also honored for his heroism and to call him the ""BLACK guy"" and use him to make a point is really low .  If you think this is not a racially based remark, why was black in all caps."
Yes.  They fought and died so that black athletes have the right to protest racially motivated police violence.  We live in a Democracy...not a fascist police state.  So stifle it..!!
"Hello Dante,

Um, no.

The sentence: ""He voiced support for business owners who choose not to serve gay and lesbian clients""...

... um, no, that sentence emphatically does NOT accurately reflect his quoted statement.

His quoted statement could be paraphrased as: ""He has voiced support boycotting businesses seen by opponents as promoting a gay agenda in advertising"".

That is NOT the same thing as only saying ""voicing support for business owners who choose not to serve gay and lesbian clients"", which implies that folks are not allowed in the store and are refused service if they do walk in, along the lines of black segregation decades ago.

This is a matter of clarity in journalism, not a matter of interpreting the Bible. You are conflating matters."

"Agree. As a southern-raised conservative Christian who believes that God made all of us equal in our humanity, I find it very easy to understand why blacks would be deeply offended to see the Confederate flag.  Its defenders say it doesn't stand for racism, by those who fly it are not especially marked by their passion for equality, are they?  They say it stands for a noble cause --- resistance to Northern Aggression and the Right to Secession.  But what was the cause of that cause?  Slavery.  And that flag, if it ever had a noble significance, completely lost it during the civil rights era, when it was flown as an express symbol of resistance to the Equal Protection Clause.  It's meaning is clear enough, and it offends.  Agnikan is right:   If this flag DOESN'T offend you, you need a history and an ethics lesson.  And a lesson in basic Christianity and the meaning of empathy."
"Imagine if this had been done by a dark-skinned man with a foreign name from a ""Muslim country.""  Trump would probably hit the launch codes. This is home-grown terrorism of the worst sort, and most people will shrug and say, well, what can you do? The Second Amendment cannot be questioned! Really? The Constitution once said slavery was O.K., and that was changed without destroying the Republic.  The Constitution once said only male land-owners could vote. That was changed, and still the Republic stands.  The Constitution was once amended to prohibit the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating beverages, then amended back again, and STILL the Country did not descend into anarchy and moral turpitude.  I think we can survive a little tweaking of the Second Amendment without undue alarm. Every other civilized country in the world seems to be doing fine without continuing to live in some fever-dream of the Wild West that never was.  America's love affair with bang-bang must end."

Besides, I was often being really ""snotty"" and provoking her.  ""Whatcha goinna do about that?  Huh?  Huh?""  Technically, it may have been domestic violence, but we really couldn't hurt each other.  We were too evenly matched.  But that was just us.  I believe that physical violence against a measurably weaker partner should be heavily sanctioned ... and that excessive, especially mean-spirited, verbal abuse against an emotionally weaker partner, be they either male or female, should be classified as Domestic Violence also.  Note:  Both of us were 24-7-365 open carry, and never even once, thought about taking our arguments that far."

"""Clearly aggravated""? Did we watch the same video? She was calm and didn't raise her voice at all. She wanted to know why she had been stopped and why her tags were run - completely normal response.

""We pull people over all the time just to check if cars are stolen"" is a weak excuse. If that's the truth, why didn't he just tell her that to begin with? And in any case, she's a well-dressed black woman in a nice car, it's obviously not stolen. If he didn't have the tool he needs to measure window tint, he shouldn't be eyeballing it - he should be fully equipped for his job and he should be carrying his card on him at all times. The issue here is that cops need very little reason to stop people and that's why racial profiling is such a problem. There needs to be more regulation and clearer protocol for traffic stops."
"Absolutely.  I'm just thinking about the availability of those other resources. If your first resource is contraception, and there isn't much in the way of secondary resources, or much sense that society has any dignified use for you or any children you may choose to have, it's not a huge leap to think there's a whiff of eugenics around that first resource. I think well intentioned people can easily miss that, and fail to appreciate how that can contribute to the understanding that little value is placed on the lives of poor people of color. 

Birth control is fundamental to women's equality, but it will not achieve the equality of poor women of color.  It just won't. It opens up worlds of possibility to women who do not belong to the underclasses, but those worlds remain largely closed to the rest, however many children they do or don't have."

"So Ryerson thought  a particular way in his time.  I agree that it is so important to understand the time and why he and others thought the way they did.  The good he and others did in our history should be examined as rigorously as the mistakes and problems encountered over the actions and thinking of the time.  Yes, Ryerson thought of a seperate school system for a group of people.  We see remnants of those thoughts in Ontario today so does the idea in general work?  After all, Ryerson did not set up or operate the residential schools.   More recently, all Ontario governments have maintained  and supported the Catholic separate school system and also advocated for and implemented separate black-centric schools."
"Looking for solutions2--  While I found nothing  to confirm Joseph Lane was ever a slave holder, I did find some extraordinarily interesting material on Lane for which I am enthusiastically grateful to you.  As I have no time at the moment to digest all this, I'll be very brief:
First, that Oregonian opinion piece with the link here does claim Lane was a slave owner and cites  several sources to back him up, such as the Oregon Encyclopedia and Wikipedia.  However, I can find NO place where they  actually state Lane was a slave owner.  

However, there is a reference to the idea that some have claimed Peter Waldo, a young black man who lived with him on his ranch was a slave.  This linked to a fantastic source, truwe/tina, on Southern Oregon History.  This has an incredibly extensive list of historic  items on the complex relationship between Lane and Waldo, much of which was new to me.
Thanks again LFS2, you've given me much to ponder."

"I think individuals care more than our governments do.  When I think of the conditions inside that country--the starvation due to mismanagement and corruption, the state sponsored--or required--of family members spying on each other and reporting the smallest infractions that often lead to death sentences, horrible work camps, it makes me ill.. A satellite map of the world shows a black hole at night where North Korea should be.  And that fat psychotic killer with the bad hair killing his own relatives in the most horrendous ways is absolutely sickening.  The North Korean people will never be able to mount a revolution due to being absolutely repressed and brainwashed. Heard an inteview with an escapee who had been forced to kill his own mother.

"""most Canadians have an attitude of live and let live..."" And, more to the point, they--and most of us--think so!

1. Good to let more Muslim refugees in next year.
2. Hey, it's a free market economy!  No government interference in the real estate sector.
3. We gotta take Mosul, and if that means turning ""advising"" Canadian Forces into ""shootin'"" Canadian Forces, so be it. 
4. Legalizing pot is A-OK.
5. Let Black Lives Matter dictate Pride Parade rules. It's racially prejudicial to do otherwise.
6. We shouldn't investigate what Muslim teach in Mosque classes.  It's their right to teach what they want.
7. A very low rate of police department ""unfounded files"" sexual assault files is very good. 

See?  I believe most Canadians pick and choose their live-and-let-live moments--and your moments may not be mine."
"Trump simply can not go a day without lying. He has corrupted and debased the Presidency and American culture to the point it may never recover.
Instead of the howling from conservative Caucasian preachers about a black President being the 'Anti-Christ,' Donald Trump has become the most evil, divisive, selfish, corrupt, untrustworthy Machiavellian figures in modern history.

These preachers and their so-called 'religion' never got past the color of the President's skin. Ignorance and ineptitude are natural consequences of bigotry combined with fear."
"The point is if everyone is getting equal opportunity? Canada is a lot better at providing equal schooling ot the rich and poor (this has been shown in the recent article called ""Education Superpower"" which was about Canadian school systems).

I believe them to be AntiAmerican, Unconstitutional and Terrorist Organizations and they should be treated accordingly.

"""Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.""

I think it is outrageous for the writer to make this claim.  Lead poisoning is tolerated because by and large it is invisible and is not routinely detected.  Until a few years ago, copper pipe used to disperse water throughout our buildings was joined with lead containing solder.  Probably most houses in the country have lead in their pipes.  When water is not used often lead from the solder can dissolve and reach appreciable concentrations.  

The big thing about lead is that it takes really high doses to produce obvious symptoms.  To some extent low dose exposures are not obviously connected to harm.  The whole subject is controversial.  Run your water a bit before drinking it to flush the high lead content out."
"At first. But after that? Black and Green can co-exist, but, yes, the weaning has come."
"You know, Jesus railed against the Pharisees because they were hypocrites.  They lived by the ""letter of the law"" doing things like declaring their wealth korban (dedicated to the temple after their death) so that they didn't have to provide for the upkeep of their elderly parents.  He didn't condemn people like the rich young man who came to him saying he lived all the commandments; in fact, the Scriptures say he looked at him with love.  Jesus said he did not come to abolish the law.  The Scriptures tell us the true Christian is the one who loves his brother and keeps the commandments.  How is it loving to ""accompany"" someone who is living opposite what Our Lord himself preached?  The one who divorces his or her spouse and married another is committing adultery."
"""What do we want dead cops, when do we want them now!"" This chant are others of a similar nature have been heard and recorded at several BLM marches...five Dallas cops were killed at a BLM march, for BLM to then condemn someone for taking this very action they, at the very least failed to control, is hypocritical. For Obama to invite them to the White House was simply him, once again raising his middle finger to law enforcement, and law abiding Americans."

"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States.
.
His latest refusal to stand for the anthem -- he has done this in at least one other preseason game -- came before the 49ers' preseason loss to Green Bay at Levi's Stadium on Friday night.
.
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""

Wife says ""What do we do if they come towards us?""  I replied ""We run.""  Wife says ""We can't outrun those bears.""  I said ""We don't have to outrun those bears, we just have to outrun these two,"" while pointing at the kids.  Wife and I giggled, then the littlest one looked at the bears, then at me, and stuck out her lower lip, saying ""I don't think that's funny at all.""  Which just made us giggle even more.  We then moved off to a safer distance."
I'm guessing there were at least some number of players who didn't like or didn't agree with Obama. Did the team make sure those players got to show their unity? Its amazing after electing a black president twice and having black attorney generals for 8 years this country has more racial division than ever. So who's fault is that? Kap took a knee during Obama. What was Obama's response? The statistics don't lie - blacks kill blacks. Blacks kill police officers. Six police officers were shot in 3 different cities in August. What was the players response to that? The message is bogus - there are more successful blacks in this country than any other time. Check out Heather MacDonalds piece on nypost.com. Those are the real facts and the players are only serving to distract from them and the problems left by the Obummer presidency. You had the presidents full attention last weekend and instead of going to the table to discuss your protest you flip him the bird. Frauds!
"the nfl and team owners have not spoken out against kapernick's to protest racism by not standing for the national anthem.  he was not suspended by the SF 49ners nor did they ask him to refrain from doing it.  hence, this shows that they approve of the behavior.  so if the owners and nfl do not see anything wrong, then why should trump impose himself, it is none of his business.  the nfl is a private business and they can determine what they want to do.  the only reason trump intervened is because black players were involved, showing his racist attitude.  why do you think he did not immediately try to help Puerto rico - because most of the people are Hispanic or black.  he ignored them and their need for assistance for a week and a half and only when he was called out for his ignoring them, then he decided to do something.  trump is racist and bigot. it has been proven over and over again.  what is the non-literal meaning of SOB?  there is none."
"When was that? Probaby way before the huge changes that have occurred since then, so that women are now half or more of classes in medicine, law, accounting, finance, etc. Just not some areas of STEM.
 
You can't compare the situation 30 years ago to the one now, where women are highly encouraged to go into STEM.

Blacks now are over-represented in certain sports, who is calling for parity?"
"The reason for targetting black drivers was obvious: they are less likely to have lawyers (that this led to it having racist outcomes is a definitely true fact, even if it's unlikely the motivation was race-hatred [the main enforcer of the scheme was himself black]). 

There is an on-going court case over that, and it seems likely that the town will be be slapped severely enough to stop this method of revenue generation - but it took many years to get this far.

So yes, we should move police authority to the local (or possibly provincial) government level, but in doing so we must take care to preserve critical oversight systems - and possibly even avoid localising them at all. It may actually make sense with local-run police to keep IPID as a national-level organisation - which all of them are accountable to."
"You are blaming the poor for their poverty. Benefits make them unpoor if you count them as income. Granted, people should be paid to go to school, both in and before they get benefits and instead of special income maintenance benefits, the poor and the middle class should all get a universal tax credit of $1000 per month per child wages or other benefits.  Prison for trivial drug crimes and bad segregated schools ruined the black family. Bussing probably would have prevented this."

"That's out of context. Clinton got more than 90% of Black votes. If you read trash, your brain becomes trash. There was no conspiracy. Politics is hardball, that's all. Bernie didn't lose significant votes because of any Clinton campaign tactics. Clinton won because more people trusted her. 

When are you going to write an intelligent comment? Something that shows common awareness of reality, and not some propaganda you've been fed?"
Allie has a point for some there is hatred of military presence in Hawaii and some might be targeting them because of their race.  The murdered serviceman was African American.
"True. Still, I would like to see responsible journalists ask him the question and get it in video format, preferably. 


See if he can answer it without the fake news spin of talking about Obama or BLM, or anything else off-topic , and just get one of them - for once - to act responsibly. 


I'd love for at least one of the cons to be questioned about their role in dividing this once-great nation. Trump is a symptom of a multi-decade effort, to be sure. But still, it'd be responsible to ask him on the record."
"""We might very well suspect that the law enforcement personnel in Euro-American North Dakota who drenched the Native American water protectors with water cannons in sub-freezing weather and injured many of them have been encouraged to be as tough as they like consequent on the election of a bigoted racist pro-oil pro-pipeline climate-change-denying bully for president.""

What a bigoted statement.   The Dakota have so much as said they will not leave by peaceful means. The immediate looking to the race of those using water-cannons on those disobeying a court order is almost amusing.  But has Mr. Caponigro even checked the race of the law-enforcers?  Does it dawn on him that some of them may have been black, hispanic, or even Indian?"

You speak of an integrated school, but from your statement it is clear that you are fine with any or all neighborhood families being thrown out of Ainsworth (""redistricted"") so long as you are not affected.  The worst kind of hypocrite is the one that does not even realize it.

BTW I am brown, so don't bring your racist BS argument here. Can you reconcile your statement with the fact that the Ainsworth SI program has so few minorities? Why are you so opposed to making the program more inclusive?"
"1 - It's in the article.
2 - Define ""many"". A majority of black voters still favour Democrats.
3 - I didn't know there was a ""Liberal"" party in the US of any significance. And it's pretty ironic of you to post this claim while providing no evidence yourself.
4 - Evidence?
5 - Are you suggesting that should be enough to keep these ""uppity blacks"" satisfied?"

"And who would the unbiased sources be? Federal bureaucrats who gave 90% of their political donations to Democrats, whose party leadership cares more for acquiring reliable blocks of voters than in doing what's best for Americans and America's fiscal stability? I was a Democrat. And then I lived in two inner cities and witnessed first hand what I came to see as self-interested political leaders who only stop by every other November to pick up the votes of inner city residents. I've read that (Democrat) Patrick Moynihan warned his Party that the way they (LBJ and Congressional Democrats) were structuring welfare would destroy the Black American family. For his troubles, Senator Moynihan was roundly castigated by his fellow Democrats. And now we have millions of fatherless children in our inner cities (the illegitimacy rate has tripled since the War on Poverty began). I have been reading the Los Angeles Times for years. If the paper is not a pro-illegal immigrant echo chamber what is?"
"And roughly 15% of the population are black. That sort of gives new meaning to those numbers. Also, you're clearly not educated about the NFL and you should stop talking about things you don't understand. Their protest is in no way a breach of contract, and as a private employer, the NFL and it's teams have made it perfectly clear through statement after statement there is no requirement to stand for the national anthem. I don't agree with the protest either because I think it's mixing personal and professional affairs, but you're just reaching by suggesting it breaches their contract."
"I've said from day 1 this was a person who attempted to murder Mayac. This entire stupid assessment of a bear and moose attack is smoke. I mentioned the spot as a high crime area parking lot now. NOT a ""Park"" for families anymore. I guess the Police and other F&W ""know"" what's best so we should just shut up and stand in line, and let them go shoot more ""problem bears"". Good thing a black person was not involved, or they might have just went and found one in the area."
"A lot of false promises made by both parties, that's for sure.    i think Bill Clinton was/is well liked, not because of his official status, but because he simply likedI being around black people.   It's not always about money.    Not all black want or need assistance, but all would like basic human respect.   The Clinton and Obama's have both moved comfortably around black Americans of all incomes.

Generational poverty is really tough to break for anybody, racial bias just adds to the already tough position of a child born to poverty."
"What's the rush on this?  

Legalizing doesn't cut out the black market.  They just offer newer/different strains, higher potency or mix it with other drugs.

Cannabis legalization results in increased traffic deaths from driving while under the influence.  We don't even have a reliable method to do a roadside test yet!!

If the cons are able to roll back net neutrality, they will be working to dismantle everything about what made the Internet great, and they may essentially break the Internet, making it the plaything of huge private tyrannies only, and killing off future innovation - at least in the United States.


I know that many cons are so racist as to want to wipe out every last bit of the black President's legacy because they are so very hateful and twisted, but they should know net neutrality existed since the dawn of the 'net, and Obama has nothing to do with it. Much like the concepts in the ACA, but that fact doesn't change their mind on ""Obamacare"" much, either."

  But I do know once in power Obama could never have been mistaken for the successor to MLK. During Obama's 2008 campaign, his speeches made liberals weep with hope. When he won the presidency they wept for joy. And during his eight years they wept in sorrow and rage as police gunned down black men in the streets.

"About a year ago I saw a short segment on ""Diversity"" in IT. Not too surprisingly the manager being interviewed described ""Diversity"" as a strength and gave an example of a black IT worker being able to solve some problem. 

The only thing was, as I was listening to this, I thought, 'Yeah, that's pretty much what any competent systems analyst would do to solve this problem.' And there are a lot of things you do in IT that are simply 'problem solving', such as debugging a report to determine why a number in a report is wrong. And regardless of what your background is, you'd probably go through the same steps. 

It is when the 'Diversity Advocates' start pushing the party line to the point where it starts sounding suspect that I get turned off."
"anniec, thank you.  I think it would not be good for all of Christianity if it were ""under one roof.""  In fact, I suspect that the number of different Catholic groups will continue to grow, recognized or not.  I think of groups of Catholics who accept women priests, or Catholic churches that recognize LGBT marriage.  The Catholics who worship there still consider themselves as ""Catholic"" even if some other Catholics don't and the official RCC doesn't.

I would think that some cultural differences in Africa, Asia, Latin America, among Native Peoples here - if incorporated into how they practice faith and even into some differences in what they believe would actually make Catholicism more ""at home"" within those cultures.  I am thinking of cohabitation in Africa after parents have arranged a marriage but before the bride price is paid - a practice that seems to work in their cultures but would not/does not work in others.  Why not recognize this?"
"Eugene knows next to nothing about racial conflict in this community.   It isn't that prejudice is hard or low in Eugene, we just don't have a significantly sized black community of residents.    Our prejudice is never challenged outside of our normal ideological/partisan battles.   CMD is clearly offering a negetive stereotype and the bias is clear.  Even at that, one foolish comment by CMD has zero effect on meeting the challenge in racially diverse cities(black in particular)."
"You lost me at the 'racial-pandering' bit, AC, but then you seldom make sense when it comes to 'race' anyway.  But by all means, tell us what you meant by that.  Were the black Union troops somehow incompetent or 'inferior' according to you?  Should they have been relegated to cooks and stewards for the officers, as they would be in the US military only a decade or so later?

Sorry, that wasn't what contemporary observers had to say about the matter.  Were it not for the 'colored' troops, it's likely the Confederacy would have won the war (instead of subsequently achieving a 'victory' of sorts via infiltration and political treachery that continues to this day).

I believe it was in a letter to Karl Marx that Frederick Engels observed the Union was doomed to defeat without black troops, and if they refused to conscript them ""...they'll get a hiding, and they'll deserve it."""

They see it every day and their own experience forewarn them of what to expect and who they are at greatest risk from. Your son is collateral damage in the collapse of black urban culture.

"Yes, it was interesting and more than a bit ironic  how he chose to make comments about anti-Semitism while he was at the Museum of African-American History.  It would've been more relevant had he spoken specifically about Islamophobia, particularly since many slaves brought to the American colonies were Muslims.  Apparently the connection didn't occur to him -- probably because of his own Islamophobia.   Sad!"

Thrown into jail one night and stood in front of a judge who handed me my punishment and said. If I did not do it I would be arrested again and would be put in jail for 3 to 6 months.

I'm all about people getting along or leaving each other alone, respecting boundaries and belongings, and agreeing to disagree. What I've personally experienced and seen is a mainstream popular black culture that has embraced those things listed above that I — and all decent people — despise.

"Father Peter Maher was parish priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church Newtown in Sydney's inner west for twenty plus years.  At his Thanksgiving Mass on Retirement just a few days ago, his homily was a beautiful tribute to the inclusive community that has been built at that parish and his thanks to all in the community.  He talked about the growth in awareness of ways in which we discriminate, or ""othering"", seeing those who are not part of the dominant group as ""other"" - to use Mikulich's story line, as Muslim, farmer, African American, Jew.  And as Fr. Peter says:  ""These and many more are not the ""other"" to be feared and kept at arm's length, but people to be included and honoured and valued as sisters and brothers.""

It is well worth reading to see what can be done in a parish community when this ""othering"" is recognized and addressed as part of the faith journey.  The homily is here:  http://newtownfaith.blogspot.com.au"

"The point you are missing James007 is that the mass immigration that has been championed into Canada the past several decades has been politically and ideological in concept. It is not need that has championed this constant mass inflow but rather the formation of ethnic entities that serve as voting blocks in the future for political parties in power. This is precisely why Liberals want a constant flow of Muslim migrants to form additional and larger ethnic enclaves in major cities to do what they do best. And that is to stay together, stay non assimilated and dutifully vote for the party that let them in.  Trudeau changing citizenship requirements to three years residency is all about the vote. Shake your head once and then shake your head again. Reality is what it is. The result has been the mass formation of disparate and isolated ethnic enclaves with no relevance to one another or a cohesive nation. That is our future according to Liberals.

"If he condemns their group(s) by name he would also have to condemn BLM, Antifa and whatever else was out there.  He said ""many sides"" which covers the mess impartially.

But what he did....he was only 13 years old, I doubt if he even fully understood.....so even if I think he should taken to a wall and shot (metaphorically), I can give him a pass for what he did as a kid.

Many of the people were under the false promise that the government would take care of them, because of Social Security, and they didn't have to do anything themselves. Liberalism has destroyed the black family, with it's false promises. In the 60's only 20% of black families were headed by a single parent. Today that number is 70%, and it's the flag and the National Anthem that's the problem. Government is and always has been the problem. The government doesn't solves problems, it creates the problem, and then magnifies the problem by fixing it. Think Health Care."
"Thanks to Google, I have found that many developed countries have some version of B-BBEE, wee procurement policies are directed at benefiting/uplifting the minorities usually, usually black people as an acknowledgement of their historical deprivation.

Finally, as within other areas, there are no monitoring systems or capacity, just like with the social grants and RDP houses."

The Pew Research Centre survey of American Muslims found that 59% believe that following the Quran and Sunnah is essential to their identity as Muslims. So that includes the punishment of stoning  adulteresses, and don't even think about fornication! Although the Islamic Supreme Council of America helpfully points out that the standard of proof for an accusation is so high that it's hard to get a conviction. Africa contains 1.25 billion people. In Pew's survey of countries with Muslims, most wanted Sharia as the law of the land (1 country @ 35%, 2 @ 47%, the rest 50% + up to 86% in Niger). As a convinced secularist, I think that I should be wary of irrational, absolutist beliefs and the believers."

It'll be a different future, but there is a future."" Sr. Teresa Maya, LCWR president-elect, as quoted by Soli Salgado  Latinos have and do not deny their Black identity.  “The Lord, your God . . . befriends the alien, feeding and clothing him.  so you too must befriend the alien, for you were once aliens yourselves in the land of Egypt” (Deuteronomy 10:17-19).  “Praise the lord, Jerusalem” (Psalm 147:12a).”  That’s us, the Faithful, here.  “But that we may not offend them . . . You will find a coin worth twice the temple tax (that the Faithful have to bear from the present lawyer-laden hierarchs destroying victims, as they coverup sexual abuse by stressed-out priests)  Give that to them for me and for you” (Matthew 17: 27)"

Fr Orobator makes another point.  These women will come from the same African tradition he did and they will have a very different conceptualization of God.  They will know God in both a female and male context and will have experienced powerful women spiritual leaders.  Traditional spiritual traditions are no where near as male dominated as traditional Christianity.  It may be that the theology you seek will come from the African women he is mentoring and empowering.

"Glen,

Practical.  Practice.   I had men working in Gary, Ind. who were robbed at lunch time. Mexicans, robbed by Blacks.  The robbers told the Mexicans if they told the police, they would come back and kill them. As we had an obligation to finish the contract, we did the right thing. We shut up and went back to work.

That is practical.  The police couldn't reasonably be expected to protect the men and neither could I their employer.  Neither could the power company we were working for do anything to protect them.  They had to protect themselves.

Obviously, work assignments like this in Gary, Ind. have to be temporary.  Who would want to move in and live there permanently? 

 The answer to all this is the 'shine' girl's answer. ""Me? I am a good child""
Until and unless the robbers repent and reform, their town (fellow man and woman) will suffer under their exploitation.  There are no institutional solutions, apart from the institution of the family."
They boycott the inauguration the same way many black voters boycotted the election. They didn't vote for Hillary just as they didn't vote against Trump. Then they  complain their voices aren't being heard.  We do in fact hear their voices. But it is up to them to make up their minds.

"Obama would have gotten nowhere with his policies were it not for a corrupt, lapdog press, an ideologically driven academia, and an American idol pop culture that only cared that we had our first black president. Republican opposition to his policies has been a sad joke on the people that gave them two landslide elections. 

This president and his party have only one goal as far as immigration goes and that is to flood this country with third world dependent people that will eventually gain citizenship and vote democrat in perpetuity. Sad thing is that the next generations will not really know what was frittered away by this generation as they pay off the credit card that was run up just to make this president look good and keep the current population docile. You refugee/ immigrant supporters need to look closely at what's happening over in ""enlightened Europe"" for a glimps of this nation's future if you don't get a clue. No one has a right to come here. Hey, how do ya spell glimps?"

"""Companies in the highest quartile of racial or ethnic diversity are 35 per cent more likely to outperform those in the bottom quartile"" Anybody know where she got this? I don't believe her unless ""outperform"" is measured by self-reports rather than the bottom line.      
Ironic how she prefers a product made in relatively homogenous environment: ""I like German engineering"". German and Japanese companies are far less racially diverse and have stronger emphasis on ""fitting in"" yet are more efficient, competitive, and cohesive than more diverse organizations elsewhere.
I wonder how well she would fit in at a law-firm of mostly blacks or south-asians, epecially when it came time to leave work early for ulitimate frisbee.
 The author argues for more objective selection procedures based on merit, which I agree with, but she contradicts herself when she then praises BMO's affirmative action hiring, which is ultimately a form of discrimination that leads to unjust outcomes for everyone."

Police officers that shot civilians are tried like any other citizen.   Data also shows police violence against black men is actually rare.   The current narrative stating otherwise is false, simply to promote an agenda.  the real crime is the perpetual poverty facing blacks.   27% of the US is black, 13% live in poverty.  That is what should be addressed, not taking cops and turning them into scapegoats.

"Christopher Columbus was a man of his time. Sure what he did to the Indians were wrong by our standards today but they weren't so wrong by his standards back then. And yeah, Columbus didn't discovered the new world. I think the Vikings, Chinese and even Africans or Romans may have beaten him to the punch. And Indians immigrated to North and South Americas long before from the Asiatic continent. But Columbus did discovered the new world for the Europeans and opened up this world for the Europeans and their descendants. People like Elise are here because of Columbus and if she think Columbus did wrong, she can pack her bags and go back to Italy. Without Columbus, she won't be here. This is liberal hypocrisy at its worst. Condemning a man from a different time period, but yet taking advantages of what he did. Birth of the  United States is a direct result from actions and behavior of Columbus and his kind. If Columbus was wrong, our nation was wrong....Elise, aren't you pack yet???"

"The Deady Hall renaming drive teaches us something important.  Just a Oregonians were blind to the evils of traditional slavery 150 years ago, modern do-gooders are blind to current evils.  Today, 1 percent of the American population has been enslaved in the prisons.  Blacks and minorities are disproportionately represented.  A few are there because they pose a serious threat to others.  Most are there because Americans still don't get it when it comes to respecting fellow humans.  Those who expend energy on the dead Deady issue, apparently have no problem with the enslavement of so many, this time in cages where every action including excrement is monitored and controlled.  The blindness of the many to current atrocities and the focus on those past that no one can do anything about is so representative.  We still do not respect our fellows.  Start with current practice which can be changed.  The focus on the past is cowardly and empty."

"Ross Coen - People from that time as well as historians have made that generalization. I suppose some North and South regretted the demise of slavery. Lincoln, before becoming president, reportedly made the statement that ""Slavery is like holding a wolf by the ears, you can't hold on and you can't let go"". This is not a time when people in the country should become reactionary and forget compromise. History can't be undone. Good men, all of them Americans, fought and died for the Confederacy for reasons as legitimate as those who fought for the Union. By executive order President Lincoln decreed that all Confederate veterans were to treated as Americans. If this can't be reconciled, then the country will be torn apart again.

"Andrew there are many South Africans that are very grateful for the stand you took, and for sacrificing your career (and home) because of your integrity.

Shame on them for forcing their best members out of the country. It is amazing to me that you still seem to hold a place in your heart for an organization that has essentially become an organized crime syndicate. Is it not time to let go?"
These black players are really ungrateful for all we've done for them if you ask me my opinion

Your high and mighty ""principles"" aren't worth shit when you're dealing with the reality of a disjunctive choice between the two major party nominees in this election cycle.

It's also beyond condescending for you to tell black people who does and does not deserve their votes - I'm pretty sure black people are fully capable of figuring that out for themselves and voting accordingly."
Yes let's keep an eye on the Black Lives Matter movement which is a nonviolent movement.  One can't blame gun violence on the Black Lives Matter movement when they are anti-NRA.

Gallop pioneered the anonymous phone poll, asking the same questions of people regardless of  race, income or occupation.

Everything you have stated about Mr. Trump was well known and discussed prior to the election, just as Ms. Clinton, we had 2 real choices, and America decided on Mr. Trump.

Andrew Loku was picked up by officers an hour earlier and accompanied safely home, an hour later he's endangering the lives of his neighbours and refuses to follow simple instructions by the officers on scene. Bottom line, if you don't comply, you are putting them in an impossible situation and yourself in danger. In this case, albeit a tragic outcome, this was justified use of force without a shadow of a doubt. BLM's insistence that this case was somehow racially charged will only further discredit them."

And the police? The media lies about that too. Remember ""hands up don't shoot?"" The lie spread by CNN, Denver Post, WaPo, etc. That never happened. The ""black community"" time after time rallies around the most despicable people that were in the WRONG. 

I don't need to talk to someone to find out they're wrong. I see plenty of evidence of that every day without subjecting myself to hearing it in person."
Trump is exactly the president America needs today. With our country being taken over by illegal aliens and cities protecting the criminal aliens we need a tough man in charge. Not a softy like the last 8 years. Now we have Seattle trying to enable the heroin epidemic with safe injection sites. Can you see anything good coming out of this? The goal of the city should be to get people off the drugs not make it easier to stay on them. I'm hoping the Feds put a stop to this along with the sanctuary cities and illegal pot sales. We now have a president that wants to follow the laws of our country.
"Except people 'hated' Bush because he's a moron whose administration, among other things, deliberately misled the American people to invade Iraq, a 9-year boondoggle that cost the lives of thousands of coalition forces and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and at least $2 trillion in American treasure. People of all political stripes may have (rightly) questioned Bush's intelligence and competence as a leader, but I don't recall anyone on the left asserting that he was a Kenyan-born muslim and an illegitimate president. Bush was disliked for being an imbecile; Obama was hated for being black."

"While Prof. Lowenstam would be a worthy namesake, and would honor our  neglected Humanities  program, I would suggest a more appropriate name for this  ""Dunn"" residence hall would be that of Mabel Byrd, the UO's first black student,  who was herself  forbidden  to live in a campus residence hall:

  ""After graduating from Washington High School in Portland in 1914, Mabel Byrd made history as the first African American enrolled at the University of Oregon. Byrd matriculated at UO in 1917 as a student majoring in economics, and spent two years on the campus prior to transferring to the University of Washington in 1919.

While at the University of Oregon, Byrd was the only black resident of Eugene.

 Link to text.  It's DemocracyNow w/Goodman and at about 17:00 in the full show (not the link above; that's a news capture.  Anyway, this former NY Detective, African American, had an emotional moment that just moved me so deeply.   He was speaking of all of the killings and videos of racist killings of black men/boys, children...and he just couldn't talk.  I think I saw he even got embarrassed cause he was fighting the tears.  It was an extremely powerful moment because he really loved being a policeman and he is struggling.  For his people.  If you want to view it here's the link: http://www.democracynow.org/

EXCELLENT and very informative segment"
"If you don't like it here go back to Africa or wherever you came, or were taken from.  My ancestors in Eastern Europe were also slaves but instead of whining about it every day as an excuse for my laziness and n0t paying attention in school I have moved on.  I am in control of my life - not the past.  Time for people to grow up and live in the present.  BTW, blacks in the US have it far better than blacks in an black run country in Africa."
"(Part two of two)  Three times the LORD says, “you shall do no sort of work” (Leviticus 23:7, 8, 36) according to the weekday Lectionary.  The NABR has it heavy work.  Looks like the NABR is trying both to exclude politics and the moral tension between politics and truth.  “Sing with joy to God our help” (Psalm 81:2a) as happened at the Black Congress XII, all the while recognizing the dastardly politics of racism.  “Is he not the carpenter’s son” (Matthew 13:55),  Liturgy of the Word, Reading 405, Friday of the Seventeenth Week in Ordinary Time I.  Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are not howling at the moon, or as Psalm 81:4 puts it “Blow the trumpet at the new moon at the full moon, on your solemn feast.”"
"The irony is stunning.
99% of the posters think BLM has no business making themselves heard. 

This from a society where your largest minority has to appeal to the United Nations to have their human rights respected by their own government.

Where hate crimes against minorities are committed at a rate twice as high as in the U.S.

Where the group making up only 4% of the general population makes up 25% of the prison population, a rate far in excess of blacks in the U.S.

Where kids are killing themselves by overdosing on drugs at a rate twice the murder rate of NY.

The only reason to have this post deleted or even give thumbs down is because you don't like reading it."
"It’s just a weird series of coincidences based on his not knowing any better that he hired a bunch of Nazis to his staff, won’t distance himself from the Klan, hired Kobach and Hans von Spakovsky and Jeff Sessions and his only governing principle is overturning everything President Black Man did.
Really, it’s sad because he just means well and is in over his head."
"Just to clarify, the petition is not calling for his firing from the university. It is asking that he not be a senior fellow at Massey College, which is not an academic position. He is not employed by Massey College.  Also, if the title 'Master' used at a table where black people are sitting would trigger the 'same ironic thought' in most people,  then it's time for a title change, no? Many universities have disbanded the use of the term, including Harvard. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/qa-on-changing-house-master-title/"
"This is good! Now a dialogue can start between Toronto police,  BLM, and the LGBTQ community to resolve the conflict between these groups. The police and the LGBTQ community have come to a better understanding over the years now the LGBTQ and police need to work at being more inclusive of minorities and work on eliminating the racism that is so prevalent.

This is only a starting position for resolving differences. The Toronto Police will be in the march again after a year or two."

"I am completely, in opposition to your theories that flags and monuments to apartheid, or, to any other 'isms'  in past history, be destroyed.   You are continuing, to over-protect a population which, so far, has failed in achieving, any success of its own.  Witness the ANC.  And the crazy mad destruction of statues of Rhodes, etc.   Which simply, obliterate,  the history of the country.  How? Are we going to be reminded, of our history, if all symbols of that sometimes, hugely, destructive past, are destroyed.  Are you encouraging,  a repeat of all that same racism, corruption, this time in favour of the black population? 
If, you witnessed the walk of Pope Francis,  (Papa Fransi, as we call him),  at Dachau, near Munich, Germany, where the man walked alone, lost in grief and contemplation, of the awful past.  You would realise, that flags, monuments, are constant reminders,  please note,  of our past, and where we no longer wish to go.  Remove them, and repetition is inevitable."
All lives matter not only black. Time to put any color in its place if they break the law.

"Very well said.  I have never seen Ms. Khan express most of the ideas her detractors ascribe to her.  Interestingly, The Guardian hired an outside firm to analyze their readers' comments.  The data indicated that when it came to news and opinion articles, negative comments were disproportionately high for articles written by women, people with brown skin and ""non-traditional"" names.  Sheema Khan hits all three of those categories!  Often, rather than respond to her content, people pop off with remarks about the evils of Fundamentalist Islam, the terror of Sharia Law, the horrors of multiculturalism, and how ""those people"" just don't integrate (I recall the same being said of Italians in the 60s.)  I find her columns often insightful and have never once seen her attack Canada; many of the posters are simply tilting at a brown, female, Muslim windmill.

Cue the frowny faces!  :)"
"We have been providing bombs, weapons, Intel and even refueling American made Saudi jets on their way to drop American made weapons of destruction on Yemen. And now we act outraged that someone shot a missile at us? Give me a break. We are creating over there today, the enemy we will be fighting at over here tomorrow. 

The age of the Oil Wars are over - we are now a net oil exporter. We don't need Arab dictators anymore than we need African dictators or Asian dictators as our ""friends"". We never really needed them in the first place - it was the Big Oil company folks who did. 
Military alliances should be reviewed every five years to determine if they still are worthy of our defense dollars and soldiers lives. Blindly backing dictators has backfired in our face every single time. When will our leaders learn?"

For myself and apparently many others, we no longer give a crap about the blacks or their grievances.

"Substitute ""black"" for ""gay."" How does that sound? 

From all my experience with gay friends and a family member, I am convinced that people are born with a particular sexual orientation, thus created by God to be the way they are.  (Facing all the historical hatred and discrimination, who would choose to be gay??)

The Catholic Church doesn't need to compromise. It needs to pay attention to almost fifty years of scientific studies on homosexuality. 

Currently, the Church's position on the subject is as ridiculous as its treatment of Galileo.  

Using a verse in a 3,000-year-old document to understand and legislate on human sexuality  is in the same category as all those Catholics --including clergy-- who supported and justified slavery and Jim Crow because of Paul's epistle to Philemon."
"Is there distress that the nation is divided or just that this division is now so visible?  The debate has not made this any worse. ""Black lives matter"" is a statement that since the first black slaves arrived it is obvious that black lives do not matter, nor the lives of indigenous peoples, nor the lives of the thousands who are killed directly by the American war machine and the hundreds of thousands killed yearly in the perpetual conflict zones which are fed by the military industrial complex. Sounds all conspiracy oriented until one takes the time to ""fact check"". America has become a police state, with ominous state surveillance of everyone, where one can now be jailed for expressing one's opinion. It has become a theocracy, with a military indoctrinated by fascist evangelical ideologues, and a civil base ready to let loose on the new ""minority"" to target for persecution and exclusion - American Muslims. Like it or not, Trump is America, and Hillary is hardly a substitute."
"Oh Geraldine, would that the Founding Fathers had conceived of such a group as ""business owners"" and understood their need for protection!

Civil rights protect IMMUTABLE characteristics. Choosing to become a business owner is the choice to accept public accommodation. You can't choose to be black. You can't choose to be female. But you have all the choice in the world whether you wish to engage in the grubbiness of public commerce. 

(What an insult to those who have suffered -- even died -- for the right to worship according to their own conscience to sully their memory with some cockamamie insistence that worshiping Mammon is worshiping God! Blasphemy.)

BTW - there is no ""gay wedding cake"" anything. There's just a wedding cake. Mr. Phillips has a right to withhold ""expressive intent"" (that's inherently a very narrow matter) but he cannot just refuse to sell wedding cakes to whole classes of people."
But 16 blacks lawfully shot by cops across the whole country is the real problem
"Charles a few fact checks, Hickel was voted in with the black line ballot, put in place by Bill Egan.
Wally was picked by a central committee and had to meet the three year Republican party member requirement.
 This black line ballot (Egan's), had the stipulation that your vote was discarded if you crossed the black line running down center of ballot.
 Republicans on one side of ballot, Democrats on other.
Wally immediately removed that ballot, to align with the 47 ballot initiative, which wanted all candidates on same ballot."
"WTF????????????????? Just another reason along with their lopsided justice, crappy food (used to be the best burgers in Town not any more), pathetic service, (last time I went to Spur a year ago it took three waiters before I got one that spoke English I could understand), to boycott them. This proves that they do not care 1 bit for the safety and well being of children, they do nothing when kids get slapped, but shout at a black person and BAM your banned, and now they let kids into smoking areas............ DISGUSTING."
"Actually he required it in the Old Testament.   If a woman was accused of adultery she was given a drink called black water.  If nothing happened she was considered innocent, but if she aborted, she was considered guilty."
"We will see, but I tend to agree.  What Trump is covering up is his business contacts in Russia that are likely in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which his kids could go to jail for.  It is up to the Special Counsel to prove it.  

Hillary sprung her own trap by not making Booker VP (yes he is neo-lib, but not more than Hillary and would not alienate any Bernie Bots who are not already lost) to edge the black vote in the four key states she lost and by not immediately attacking Trump when he brought up partial birth abortion, which is already banned under the U.S. Code (she could even promise to support it, she would not have lost any female voters), and by showing how much the pro-life cause is an electoral exercise, not a movement to really do anything for the unborn.  She would have then got the same percentage of the Catholic vote as Obama and would have won."

For comments that are no more uncivil that what you just posted.
I once received what I call the ""black box warning"" for calling civil a comment that had four d's in a row. That was the total comment.
The Civil Comments algorithms are arbitrary and capricious.
Plus, I've heard that some partisans on both sides rate ""uncivil"" anything they disagree with, which warps the algorithm's learning process.
You state your opinions strongly, but so do I. I don't consider your comments uncivil, although I didn't read any comments on Libyan refugees."
"This is a long over do step toward providing equal protection under the law. It has taken 150 years to get to this point. The data will help improve policies and procedures. I appreciate the effort. When I came here in 1975 to attend the UO, the EPD kept a photo book of all black men that were in town more than a week. It was found by a black student interning at the EPD in the 1980's. My picture was in the book. I was stopped within a half hour of arriving. I was on foot, having arrived by air."
"You might want to edit that.  ""Fun"" may be the only thing California doesn't have restrictive laws against.

More than half of the gun deaths in this country are suicides, and the European and Scandanavian countries have comparable suicide rates; they just tend to use different means.  Of the non-suicide deaths in this country, over 55% are black on black and 17% are Hispanic on Hispanic in the urban centers, mostly related to drug activity and gangs.  Outside of the inner cities, gun crime in the United States is among the lowest in the world.

Show me one of your safer countries that is infested with Crips and Bloods, who don't, by the way, come by their weapons legally."
"How far are you willing to take your argument? 
A democracy is a place where the majority rules. No? So if 7 out of 10 Canadians and 87% of Quebeckers object to face covering garments worn by even a few women do we then not have a good argument to ban such garments?  
Not because we don't like the fashion aspect of them, but because this majority argues that the niqab is an expression of oppression and backwardness in our open society.  Today there are few in Canada, but taking Europe as an example where many city suburbs look more like Kabul than Paris, Brussels or Rotterdam we should be careful.  I'm old enough to remember when  women had to wear a hat to church and a black veil after family deaths and I for one don't want any of even that back.  
What is often ignored, and what to me is repulsive, is seeing some muslim families out for a walk with dad and sons ahead sporting their latest  shorts, Ts and sneakers while mom and daughters trail behind in head covering long garbs."

"The Loving v. Virginia case, which struck down miscegenation laws, was consonant with the 14th Amendment, and quite predictable, given the text of the Constitution.  You have not shown the error of my statement that the framers of the Constitution never DREAMED that the Amendment specifically intended to relieve blacks of racial discrimination would be used to REQUIRE the States to alter the universal definition of marriage.  

Your ""delight"" with the S.Ct.'s decision is consonant with neither the Constitution nor Catholicism nor Christianity.  Your delight is with the result of a rogue, lawless decision.  That's not American."
Orange is much more diverse than brown or black.  Embrace it.  Trump is America's first orange president.
Don't ask me to respect MLK day or any other honoring the black community until they decide as a race to clean up the hood. It starts there and builds. It's been a hundred years and billions of dollars and we are still having these issues? They can and have been just as successful and respected members of our communities as any of us. There is a problem and THEY need to address it within.
"Sigh. You were happily stating ""facts"" earlier but have yet to acknowledge that you were wrong and that both children were indeed, little girls - and his was a much older and much bigger girl. 

Most of your ""facts"" from earlier, are in actual fact, total and utter crap, and I'm afraid they paint you as racist and misogonistic. You can respond, but I will no longer raise my blood pressure by engaging with a person who cant tell right from wrong, and feels a man is justified in behaving like Nico Viljoen did because a woman ""may have"" sworn at him. I sincerely hope you are single and childless. 

Good day Le Negra. Blessings be upon you."
"You make at least three significant mistakes.  First, you say:  ""Every time one mentions some crime done to Black people, the response offered is that they deserve it.""  That's not even close to true, nevermind an acceptable minor overstatement.  This country is still rather conservative, and certainly I spend most of my time in conservative circles.  But except among the most virulently racist, I never hear anything close to ""they deserve it.""  

""Families would be strong, if the parents were proper parents.""  You say this as though it's ridiculous to believe it.  It's not.  In fact, it's generally true, which is why we try to raise children who will model on good parents.  In general, proper parenting leads to strong families.  

""What were the actual harms of Plessy v. Fergusson, and in what sense were they materially made right by Brown? (They weren't.)""   Wrong.  The actual harm of Pleassy was that the law itself allowed discrimination against Blacks.  Now, after Brown,

"I didn't make any comment one way or the other about the actions of the police officer. 

The other posted said the NRA was racist because they didn't jump to the defense of ""the black man that legally possessed a concealed weapon.""  I simply pointed out he didn't legally possess his firearm."
Got to love Trump.  No more red carpet from the Kenyan illegal idiot!  The illegal Oidiot has no roots in this country from his black half.  We need to deport him too!
"No, Art. I didn't ""meat"" that.  Admit you're lying again, or merely delusional, unless you're willing to post a source for your most recent nonsense. Most Secretaries of State are Republicans. In Kansas, home of that skunk Kobach, the KS SOS, he has Kansas City, Wichita and Topeka, somewhat ""blue"" cities. He couldn't find but about three cases, all Republicans, of fraud, despite years of his McCarthyite ""investigations."" He even accused one frequent voter of being dead. The guy, who had just finished mowing his lawn, said he felt dead, but wasn't.

Given that you're a proud Son of the Confederacy, I understand how you're bothered by black people voting."
"Any rational examination of the last 8 years will show a USA in much better shape than before. Unemployment is now about 1/2 what is was, the stock market is at record levels, the housing market has almost recovered in most of the country, we are no longer in direct battle in two unpopular and potentially endless civil wars, crime is down except in certain inner cities. other than a few domestic lone wolf attacks, inspired but not planned by international terrorism, the US has been relatively safe, and our military is unquestionably the strongest in the world. Obama Care, while suffering startup pains, and needing fixes, has generally been successful. Obama has been highly cautious and polite on race issues, but he is a moderate Democrat of Black heritage and proud of it. There has not been even the slightest hint of scandal in the very classy Obama family. Why all the anger and doom and gloom?"
"James this sounds like a call for armed insurrection, so how would you feel if black people shot a cop or two every time some gang of cops shoots a black guy because they could tell from a helicopter he was on PCP, or he reached for his wallet to identify himself at the demand of the police, or was leaving a party, or playing music in a car, or ""driving too slow"", or looked like a suspect from last weeks blotter "" wearing black T shirt, blue jeans and tennis shoes,5 ft 10 in, 180 lbs, 25 to 40 yrs old"", or they were just scared?
Many major film plot's are of a marginalized person making it to the top, Richard Prior in 'The Toy"", the slave revolt in Roman times led by............., Jesus Christ fighting the Jews and Romans, 300 Spartans against Darius I or II, The Magnificent  7 or 12, MLK, Cesear Chavez, Hitler. This stuff is not what changes the world it's the little things people do for others, the good Samaritan, struggling to uphold the Constitution, lack of hate."
"is it the same BS though? is it really the same as Black Lives Matter? you're really reaching here Frank. And I'm coming from a place that believes she's received too much backlash, but you're making some pretty terrible equivalences here, otherwise you have little to understanding about privilege."
"You got two, one at least whose political agenda required it.  I'm justified in concluding based on the fact I referenced family and you referenced ""google"" which of us is more credible concerning this.  That would be me, in case you were wondering.

""So you have two types of Negro...And during slavery you had two Negroes. You had the house Negro and the field Negro...When the master would be sick, the house Negro identified himself so much with his master he'd say, ""What's the matter boss, we sick?"" ...it hurt him more for his master to be sick than...to be sick himself. When the house started burning down, that"" (house) ""Negro would fight harder to put the master's house out than the master himself would...The house Negro was in the minority. The...field Negroes were the masses. They were in the majority. When the master got sick, they prayed that he'd die.  If his house caught on fire, they'd pray for a wind to...fan the breeze.""

"Again, I never said you did. But there are plenty among both the so-called ""liberals"" and ""conservatives"" posting herein for whom censorship as a debate tactic. What's disappointing to me--and somewhat astonishing--is that you seem to think the Democratic Party is ""revolutionary"". If I misunderstood you, I apologize.

You've certainly misunderstood me. I'm not sitting on the fence, I'm want to kick it down. It's rotten through and through, and it WILL fall. The only question is how disastrous will be its fall.

My position is the opposite of ""approval""--it's rejection of BOTH factions of neo-fascists. And I say so as someone who fully recognizes that the current version of your quote is ""first they came for the Blacks, then they came for the Muslims"". My family is both.

Since Killary KKKlinton has for the last DECADE promised to deploy nuclear weapons against Muslim countries which won't bow to the Zionist entity, why should we see her as any better than Frumpy the KKKlown?"
"Good on Curry.  Too often this man has used (black) people as props.  I recall the visit of the presidents of the HBCs -historically black colleges - who reported  after they left that they felt used for photo-ops because there was nothing of substance discussed, they were misled about the reason for the meeting. 

BTW, I hope every black/brown player takes a knee at every game- college, high school, NFL, etc.- for the rest of the reason.  Let the so-called president of the U.S. continue to call their mothers b****s."

"Let's go through some of Cal's points:

""A liberal is a liberal, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.""  If you think Hillary is a liberal, just go ask a Bernie supporter.

""When it comes to accomplished conservative female leaders...Ronald Reagan's consequential U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.""  
But not so long ago Cal said this about the UN:  ""The United Nations is a monument to man's misinterpretation of man. It is a humanist shrine to man's impossible goal of living at peace with one another.""  Consequential?  How?

""Otherwise, they would have applauded the advancement of African-Americans like Gen. Colin Powell, Justice Clarence Thomas... and conservative women like Sarah Palin""
I wonder how Powell feels about Trump?
Clarence Thomas - we should applaud L. D. Silver?
Sarah Palin - sigh...

""The left gets away with these kinds of smears because they largely control the media and the message.""
Yet here he is published in the ADN, and a regular Fox contributor to boot."
"Yes, many in the South did claim and still claim that their discrimination against Black people was/is Bible based.  I don't know what they cite - in part because I never even tried to get in a Bible verse back and forth with a Biblical literalist - useless.  Equally, true I would have lost any such battle since my religious upbringing  didn't include memorization of vast sections of the Bible.  I was raised on Catholic catechism and good manners.   

I think a modern society has to have some rules about how far someone with strongly held religious beliefs can go in expressing those beliefs when that impinges on the freedoms of others.  And that includes how far bosses can go in a business that serves the public and hires people of different/no religious faith.  Think health insurance and LGBT marriage. 

How to reconcile fundamentalism with individual freedom and opportunity is what we are trying to figure out."
Why? The only difference between you and a black woman is what you see. The rest is made up garbage. Stop rolling around in the garbage.
"That's right!  Live and let live!  So we need to allow pedophiles to do what they will because we want to live and let live.  We need to not discourage people from killing each other because we want live and let live.  We want to let people kill all Jews, blacks, Christians, etc., because it's what these people want to do and we want to live our lives the way we want to!  I think life would be so much better if we subscribed to this philosophy!

The problem with you saying we should subscribe to this philosophy is that it's absurd.  It's too simplified a statement.  What do you actually mean when you say this?  There have to be limits for society to be able to function!"

"I value Obama for his efforts to mostly keep us out of new foreign wars.  The economy would likely have progressed about the same regardless of who was president.  The jury on Obamacare is still out.  It did nothing to control costs and even left alone would likely be unsustainable because of the rocketing costs.  Besides, just look at the family recently highlighted in the RG basically begging for funds to support their child's skull fixing operation.  The child was identified as being insured by Obamacare.  It was also important to have a partially black President."
"I applaud you for wanting to be buried with your neighbours.  :)   

I think we should ban all denominational cemeteries period.  God/Mother Nature  or the Divine Source must be appalled that we need to feel separate. 

To the writer don't forget that Canada is swiftly becoming a secularist society, so people will become uptight about such moves, just as there is a big movement to stop funding for Catholic schools.    I am not a fan of secularism as I think it leaves out an important part of the equation for humans....

In time Muslims will be accepted....you are putting in your time to be accepted; as horrible as that sounds it is true... just as the French did, Catholics,  Irish, Jews, Blacks, etc.....  Muslim's appear to be the latest to undergo this and one thing not in your favour is your desire to remain more distinct than the rest (schools, head scarves etc.).

I can 100% guarantee you right now right here that your children are going to need therapy after having been raised by you.
Yeah, and fathers raping their daughters used to be normal too. But things change. 
Women used to not be able to work LGBT people used to be locked away in institutions were they would get their brains fried, and black people would get lynched. But obviously the bad things eventually stop.

Not sure why this is such a controversial issue.  I know veterans who support the protest (i.e. they fought for the right for those to express themselves) and vets who think the whole thing is silly and disrespectful.  In the end it is under two minutes that this freedom to protest occurs.  Why all the fuss over two minutes?  Sigh!  Remember that the original intent of the protests were to bring attention to police violence and harassment on African Americans.  Which is a problem in this country that needs to be addressed - its intent was never to demean veterans who fought valiantly for the right to protest.
Might as well face facts and move on.  Not only blacks are discriminated upon. Make the best of it.

The context was completely left off.

"As a HART Rail Consulting party I attended a meeting on Tuesday about how the histories around each station would be presented. There was barely ANY mention of the very rich Hawaiian history of the Ewa Plain and Honouliuli. In fact the HART Rail plans to focus on Japanese Internment as the primary historic feature of West Oahu, Ewa Honouliuli. It's the victimizing of Japanese thats the history feature...
.
Then as we move to Waipahu, there isn't any mention of the plantation era, ranches, numerous springs, shark goddess, it's Quonset Hut 33 where apparently a few black sailors
were involved in the ""Honolulu Race Riots"" of WW-II.  A small footnote in WW-II history because the CENTRAL FOCUS of HART Rail Station ""history"" - more VICTIMS of RACISM is what rail rider tourists will learn.

The few Hawaiians attending the meeting asked why there was little IF ANY stories about Hawaiians - particularly positive stories of people, places. Hawaiian history NOT important,

"The worst thing is that the supposed ""patriots"" like trump and those so incensed by seeing black players silently and peacefully protesting racial injustice during the anthem that they are claiming to boycott the NFL, had no thoughts of boycotting the NFL because of players who commit violence against women. 

Jerry Jones threatens to bench his players if they don;t stand for the anthem but he had no problem hiring and playing Greg Hardy the wife beater. And he fought hard to prevent the NFL from suspending Elliot the girlfriend beater (though yay! he lost).

I didn't hear any calls for boycotts when Jamis the rapist, came into the league. How long did Sebastien Rapeykowski play without a peep from fans? How about Big Ben Rapistburger accused twice and bought his way out with settlements. No boycotts for him. 

Seems like a poignant commentary on our nation. Violence against women? Meh. Black men protesting? How dare they!"
"So why not  make a motion to reduce racism and religious discrimination, including blacks, chinese, jews. muslims, etc.

"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.

 Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.” 

Ungrateful is the new uppity. 

Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans. 

Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of this weekend but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
"Except no cops got punched, so there's that. What about the Black therapist in Miami who laid down on the street, with his hands up, telling that cop he was not armed, and STILL got shot?  Did he deserve it too?"
"Deliberately misgendering a trans person while using all caps to do so, is offensive not just an opinion. It is equivalent to purposefully dropping N bombs when speaking about a person of color. This is not a matter of ""opinion"" it is a matter of human rights.

As to the Confederate statues, they wrre never really to celebrate Lee or whoever else but to warn black people who the real bosses are.

"Regarding your schadenfreude at people who ""don't comply with police instructions . . . "", what can I possibly say?   Good for you?   I have no idea how to respond to that.   Nothing like superficial framing lacking any measurable context loaded with emotional value-laden BS, is there?

I find the entire practice of overbooking to be more than questionable.  I agree with black dude, and the people at United took zero responsibility for the fact they created a situation that routinely requires someone's travel, and very likely someone's work, and possibly someone's life to be disrupted, sometimes quite seriously disrupted, even damaged.   They took zero responsibility for creating the mess in the first place, and I find the fact that they were indifferent to the individual's own professional and personal needs to be morally reprehensible.  

But we aren't where we are - having trashed the entire planet - because human beings are so good and so smart."

"If witness testimony related there was gun fire and a black man ran from the crowd, should they not stop black men who were nearby and fit the description.  Ignore them simply because they are black and may feel inconvenienced?  Is it now any time a black man is questioned about an incident it's done out of racism and deceit?  Had you been in that crowd, you wouldn't want the police to identify and arrest the shooter.  Do you think they just announce themselves?  Hey, it was me, not that black guy.  This world is going a little top heavy on labeling any encounter racism and profiling.  My vote is for the cops to just say screw it, they can pick your dead body up after the fact and label it an accident, save not to insult anyone."
"Indeed the election of President Obama has seemed to divide our nation regarding race.  However, what it's actually done is bring the ""closet"" racists out from the shadows.  There have been millions of racial slurs against President Obama posted on various sites.  Some of those sites,  it seems, are dedicated to giving racists a forum for spreading their hatred.  Some, Xavier, attempt to use this forum to vent their anger toward African-Americans and President Obama as our first Black President.  Then, when those persons are confronted on their slurs and degrading comments they accuse others of having ""thin skins.""  Refusing to accept racist and hateful comments doesn't represent having a ""thin skin.""  It represents having a semblance of human decency. While President Obama is appealing for a ""ramping down"" of violence and violent rhetoric, you, Sir, and others continue and even escalate your hateful speech.  I find that very, very sad for our nation.  Have you no decency?"

The thing is it should be accomplished by recognising talent early and developing them. To enforce a racially biased system from the top-down however, without developing from grassroots level is not sustainable nor effective. More should be done to develop young sport stars and thats where our failing economy, government and dysfunctional schooling system is failing our children"
"I'm far less concerned about my safety on the light rail in PDX than I am on the streets. Ten people are slaughtered per week just in Oregon, a substantial increase over just a few years ago. 

Also, the fatal stabbing a few months ago could have been prevented if the Portland cops would have arrested the killer the day before when he assaulted a black woman (who maced him). Unfortunately, the PPB says it won't pursue a potentially dangerous suspect until back-up shows up, so they let him waltz away from his crime and return in a more lethal state of mind. (I have my suspicions that the PPB simply won't take crimes against people of color or cyclists seriously and that's why they let the violent racist go, but that's not an easy case to prove.)"

"I agree - Obama was no more than a dream, a sick fantasy that implied that an unskilled, untried black man could actually do something good for the country (not just make people feel good for electing a black person) and he failed totally.

Now we have switched trains and so far, the track is looking clear and we are moving forward. If the hypocrites would sober up, accept their defeat and quit attacking everything he does they would likely find out we are on a far better path - obviously they are afraid of that..

"I stand up and furiously applaud banishing a garb which has been used to ensure women are viewed as non entities on the street.  This is nothing but cultural misogyny  oppressing a woman's human rights  under the guise of  theocratic approval.

Some countries so far have banned: Belgium, Bulagria, Italy, Cameroon, Niger
and many more to follow suit!

Their holy book offers no specific guidance on female clothing. Its pages contain no mention of the burka or, for that matter, of the other varieties of dress that are now associated with Islam, including the hijab, or veil.

When the Taliban captured Kabul and seized power over most of Afghanistan in 1996, they made it compulsory for all women to wear the burka.It was the rise of the Wahhabi and Deobandi traditions which spread the burka to areas where it was previously invisible, including West Africa.

"Interesting, too, is that Mormon college grads are so high, the highest, with 85% attending weekly services compared to Mormon high school grads -- 66%. Evangelical Protestants are high, too, with 58% going weekly compared to 55% high school grads. Black Protestants are similar -- with 59% of college grads going weekly to 52% high school grads doing likewise. Among Catholics, 45% Catholic college grads go to church weekly compared to 39% high school grads. This suggests -- all the more -- that Christians should be for universal education of some sort."

It's a feature, not a bug with Trump and his voters were at best ok with his illegal racism and segregation or, in the case of your Trump loving allies, Richard Spencer and David Duke, they see it as his best quality.

How low the GOP has sunk. The GOP is now the George Wallace party. The GOP is now the party of anti-black segregation. Is it any wonder why 95 percent of black Americans don't vote Republican? Every chance Republican voters get, you keep demonstrating to black Americans that they aren't welcome in your party or, given your choice for president, in your neighborhood. When you vote for an anti-black segregationist, you can't even pretend to respect black Americans anymore so stop saying ""respectfully"". You don't mean it. Racist segregationist party elects a racist segregationist. Doesn't sound very ""respectful"" to me."

"Too bad Saunders accepts Cemil Aydin‘s misplaced notion of “race” to sensationalize what is otherwise an interesting discussion of the history of Islamic identity. From a biological perspective, race cannot be applied to physical variation among Homo sapiens because there is a single human race. Race, as applied to humans, is a deeply flawed social invention reducing biological variation to the twin variables of skin colour and geographical ancestry. 

To apply it to religious variation in order to portray Muslims as despised underdogs only adds confusion to the debate over what it means to be an adherent of the faith while unfairly labelling non-Muslims as knuckle-walking racists."

Second, while synagogues have suffered from vandalism and bomb threats, at least four US mosques were outright destroyed by arson.  US Senators lined up to condemn the bomb threats but were silent about violent attacks against members of other groups.  Why is anti-semitism treated as especially bad?  Why did the authors mention the black American who made 8 bomb threats, but not the Israeli man who made dozens?  Why is criticism of the policies of Israel (or acknowledgement of their nuclear weapons) so politically incendiary?   I wonder how much of that hypocrisy and favoritism ironically leads to the vandalism and swastikas."
"I really doubt that ""since they were only after Catholics"" that it matters.  Why should they U of O have a monument to ANY member of the Klan?

Isn't that a lot like a ""non-violent Nazi?""  If you support the Klan, you are a racist.

As far as Deady goes, he was a racist, sexist, elitist.  Why, if the U of O claims to be ""inclusive and diverse"" would they fight to keep either of these ""monuments"" on their campus?  Again, if you were a person of color, and paying exorbitant tuition to go there, what would you think?  I would think that ""Hey this place is openly racist. It's not like they don't know.""

They didn't need their government's morale compass to stick it's needle into their pockets, poke out some dough, & DICTATE to them that they should Care, they just Cared all on their OWN. --- You commentators here patting yourselves on the back cause our CAn. Gov. decided to dip into everyone's funds, when we don't even know how many dollars of that will actually end up in the 'right' hands, as opposed to in the hands of bureaucratic bozo middle-men between us and those African women... If you want to donate FINE, do it! It's an INDIVIDUAL's right -- why shame others into patting your back!!"

Yes, antifluoridationists do deem facts, evidence, and peer-reviewed science to be “empty badgering” .  This is precisely why you all remain so completely uninformed on this issue.  

Since you so obviously resent our challenging and correction of the mounds of misinformation posted by antifluoridationists then simply stop posting it and we will gladly go away.  As that will, of course, never happen, you probably should just get used to us.  The days of comment sections after fluoridation articles being nothing more than cesspools of antifluoridationist hogwash are over.

"Ha.  It's about Brandon Marshall losing endorsements and the NFL rating tanking.  HYPOCRITES!  Read the attached article and tell me again how the police and brutality is involved in this?  These player protests are a joke and show how racial politics by the Left, Dems, MSM has polluted our society.  I do not hear anyone of the aforementioned groups going into the cities, like Chicago, and bemoaning the killing of Black men by black men or trying to raise up the black community in this Country.  These Players feed this narrative and do not even understand they are being used as pawns.

"A year and so ago, Naila Keleta-Mae was praising the art of the spectacle.

https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/black-lives-matter-is-dramatic-unsettling-and-inconvenient-thats-the-point/article30758467/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&

Politics as spectacle is destructive. It inflames emotion rather than stimulates reason.  One time moments of superficial drama as opposed to the construction of a long term process of engagement and dialogue.

So while I agree Trump is the sad stuff of spectacle, I suggest Naila Keleta-Mae reflect on the spectacle of those she praised. When one promotes the environment of spectacle, don't be surprised when that becomes the operating motif for all. You too become just another symptom of a deeper disease in civil society."
"Working from that human-created script just like the black pastors perform each Sunday as they pass the collection plates to enrich their own lifestyle.  Like Prevo, living large on tax exempt largesse gleaned from the gullible dupes based on an invisible power unseen and unheard by anyone ever.  Duplicate ideology to Il Duce Trump for the gleaning of the brainwashed idolators willing to cut their own throats for a laying on of hands and false promises to allay any life reality.  Leaders of the Old South Slave religions still keeping their parishioners in line to lead them into the tiny hands of the new Plantation Prince."
"Steve,
This was the party of Lincoln, the party that mustered more congressional votes than the Democrats to pass the equal rights amendment, the party that championed free trade, opened up China, argued for a fiscal restraint and celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall. It has morphed into an ethnic Nationalist party. Is this the backlash from having elected an African American President?"
"You ignore the fundamental hypocrisy of NAACP that solely and exclusively advocate for blacks or ""colored people"" (the same 19th C. descriptor used in 1909 and continues). The organization has zero to do with any other Americans. The fundamental crux of ""inclusion"" is to embrace other people. Like Pacific-Islanders? Native Americans? Asian-Americans? Hispanic/Latinos? Bi-racial? Multi-racial? Undesignated? Get the picture? 

Are we talking about income inequality, access to education, job opportunities or the like? Oh, only for ""CP""? The U.S. has the lowest social mobility for people in the middle-and-lower economic classes since the first Gilded Age. When the NAACP or La Raza or the like show up for their ""exclusivity"" we all lose. Tens of millions of Americans are mired in poverty and transgenerational poverty. Good thing we only look at their skin tone. I guess that's why the NAACP has offices on NA Reservations or Guam/ASamoa/PR?"
"Should create several foundations to take advantage of tax deductions to help downside blacks with college scholarships, civil liberties court cases, start up business support, health care hospitals, doctors, insurance support, etc. Have other rich black athletes contribute. Help your fellow blacks get out of poverty, poor education and schools, and gun violence where white government bureaucracies are useless."

"Why do we keep giving out money. The economy is strong. If you can't afford rent you're living beyond your means and/or living in a neighborhood that is beyond your means. Let's stop the handouts. What is more egregious is that if they are spending $150 million to help 300 households, that is $500,000 per household. Obviously that can't be correct. But, then again, that is how government works. Does any government ever notice that the most healthy and well run governments are fiscally conservative and not cesspools with handouts and spending? Denver needs to stop attempting to be like every bankrupt city back east."
"No, you are right, they were a group of greedy Europeans, but then the rest of the world were greedy too.  Africans sold their own people into slavery.  The Arabs facilitated the African slave catchers. Everyone was greedy, callous and indifferent.  But, for all other nations, except Canada, they have got over it.  We, on the other hand seem to enjoy the hair shirt and flagellating ourselves, trying to rid ourselves of what the Eastern intelligentsia have deemed out colonial past.  Why not say; 'Yes, we know it was wrong"" and get on with life.  There is a lot to celebrate about Canada, so forgive our fore-bearers their sins and get on with life."
"Did you mean that the old flag was meant to be a racist symbol? If so you'd best brush up on history as that flag predates apartheid by 20 years. In fact black South African soldiers fought the nazis under that very flag in the deserts of Egypt during world war 2. It has become associated with apartheid in the recent past but was never conceived as ""an apartheid symbol"". The afrikaner nationalists actually hated it when it was first introduced in 1928 because it featured the hated union flag of the British. That said I do believe that it really has no place being displayed in any public space outside of a museum due to the aforementioned modern association with apartheid."
"A protest by blacks now?  Um, not sure that's true, but even if it is, good for them.  I served to protect everyone's rights in this country afforded under the Constitution.  If a segment of our nation feels it's not being treated fairly, then they can certainly say so peacefully.  In this country, you can sit/kneel during the national anthem and not be punished for it, even if this government is trying to influence private industry to do exactly that.  If it's private industry's decision to allow their employees to do this, that too is allowed.

Too bad, so sad.  Trump needs  to grow a pair."
"""Neither Dunn nor Deady were alone in their racist views. Deady’s thinking was in line with that of most Oregonians at the time of statehood."" 

A some what disingenuous statement, ""in line with that of most Oregonians"". Deady and Dunn were active among the democrat party of Oregon. From what [limited in detail] research I could piece together other KKK members referenced as having some association with Deady and Dunn likewise were democrats. Maybe part of the answer is in Black Lives Matter needs to bill the Oregon Democrat Party for reparation."
"Dolan's 'wisdom' (prideful choice) re: personal participation on Black Friday is deplorable. IMO Trumpelthinskin and his morally bent minions will be laughing at the ridiculous spectacle of the festooned Cardinal pontificating about wisdom to a callous, corrupt dictator. Many others like me on the Day will be appalled. To the legions of Catholic walkaways, hereabouts and elsewhere, if they even momentarily notice Dolan's puffery, it will be 'ho hum, church business as usual.'"

"Black Liberalism Collective, LOL. What are they trying to liberate from themselves? The positive discrimination, the government handouts, that everyone walks on eggshells around them and caters to them?"
"The anthem is a song. The flag is a piece of cloth. Their significance is what they represent.  Until the late 1860's the flag represented constitutionally entrenched slavery of black Americans.Now it represents a society where de facto racism still persists to a great extent.

"With enthusiastic community support, the city of Eugene fittingly passed a resolution declaring the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Why? Because Columbus Day represents the brutal genocidal ethnic cleansing of the Americas.  
Yet what was our community's response to University of Oregon's ""Israel block party"" where the brutal genocidal (still ongoing) ethnic cleansing of Palestine was not condemned but celebrated? How can Arab or Muslim or Palestinian students feel safe at our university when UO-affiliated Jewish organizations hold a ""block party"" celebrating the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine and promote the IDF? What would it take for our community to understand that Palestinians, including refugees, might feel the same way about the flag of Israel that Blacks might feel when they see the Confederate flag or that Jews might feel when they see the Nazi Party flag? Has allegiance to Israel, a country that bans return of refugees it has created, replaced theology?"
"I think the media coverage of the protest had all but fizzled out, but there was still about 8 or 10 players engaged in the protest, and really, how many more were there at its peak? The fact that Kaepernick does not have a job is a constant reminder to black NFL players (and everyone else who follows the league) that the racism issue is alive and well. I think the issue will continue to flare up regardless of what Trump does or does not do."
"""Liberalism is what smart looks like to stupid people. ""  That's pretty good Dogs Out.  I'm going to give that some thought. I liked the bubble wrap on the Willamette thing too.
Figured this story would generate a lot of comments. We live in a very unforgiving country. People seem inclined to think the worse about each other these days. What she did was pretty stupid, maybe she is a ""liberal"", and thought that ""I know these people and they know me"" so there is no way they are going to think I mean any disrespect to Blacks or that me wearing this costume will be perceived as racist.  Sadly mistaken on that.
I have no idea who this person is, what they think or otherwise, but to judge a person for one dumb act and to label them as a racist based solely on this one act is wrong.  This can be a teachable moment as they say. People could use this as a way to discuss race, why they feel the way they feel, what the future should look like, etc.  Condemn the act but forgive the person."
"Thank you for raising this issue Donald. Yes any item listed in ""Community Voices"" contains editorial content and reflects whatever biases the writer has. As to your other comments I have been around, having worked on these issues for twenty years and dealt with hundreds of sex workers, mostly street walkers. Black, Hispanic, and marginalized people, doing street based sex work, were a major component of the event discussed.  I also work closely with a variety of local outreach agencies with decades of first hand experience.  No one of these people would agree with your statement that the human trafficking problem is ""huge"". Tiny would be a better word. That does not mean it should be ignored.  However, laws passed to deal with it have been drawn broadly and in fact attack a long list of harmless people.  Sex workers support targeted laws that deal with abusers and not with others whose only crime is engaging in conduct someone considers immoral."
You ever wonder why the MSM doesn't spend significant time interviewing the other 3 families who lost loved ones in Niger. Because those families will tell the truth about what happened. If you think the Big tweet phoned that family to denigrate them your dumber than a stick or that Congress woman. The Big Tweet should have said to MSM please call the other 3 families and see how I talked with them. The Big Tweet says and does stuff that is bizarre but on this one he is right on.

"The problem about Gigaba now is how, as an obviously dishonest and crooked minister, is he going to interact with investors and convince them that South Africa is a good investment destination. How is he going to convince them that their investment will be safe in SA when he, together with his deputy minister, is one of the looters? South Africa is more in trouble than we realise. Right now whatever he says cannot be taken seriously simply because of who he is, no matter how sensible he may sound. The South African economy will remain on a free fall for as long as he is in charge of our fiscus."
"Liu Xiaobo is too famous. If he was able to travel abroad his bad treatment in a Chinese jail would be a black eye for the Chinese government. He can and will speak out against China.

"So, who are Hawaii's homeless?  Perhaps mainland homeless scraping up enough for a one-way ticket to paradise's streets.  But, really, they are the born and bred goodly locals who cannot even afford one-way tickets to Las Vegas, California, Oregon, or Washington.  Of course this growing dark population will trend to crime.  Certainly, frustrated politicians will contain them in camps far away from upsetting tourists, schools, businesses, and soccer moms.  Camps will be parceled apart to avoid risk of a competing united society (like prisons) having its own governance, enforcement, and social culture.  While we publicly emote and wail over the homeless plight, we financially ignore this inevitable future as we do global warming.  Instead, we continue relentless risks and zero-sum games like throwing tax dollars at Rail.  We drive up property values and their taxes, export more locals to Vegas, and import rich outsiders to fill vacancies.  We settle on legalizing homeless camps."
"Apartheid's architects did claim that Apartheid was 'for the benefit of black people'...and yet it clearly wasn't...similarly, though Communists may claim to be motivated by equality etc., Communism when put into practice has, without exception, resulted in millions of deaths and widespread misery...so, one might say there are parallels."

"Thanks for the info. With nothing else to go on, I would agree that what they did was to be condemned. Still, it is an isolated incident.

Wouldn't it be fair, though, to say that ""some"" who were interviewed found it amusing? Can it be stated as objective fact that they all felt the same way? And is it not also possible that some who found a dramatic representation of an assassination amusing wouldn't necessarily feel the same way about a real one? (After all, there is a difference between bad taste and psychopathology.)

This is how overblown generalizations get started -- ""All conservatives are bigots,"" ""All poor people are lazy,"" ""All cops hate African Americans and vice versa."" I just don't find such judgments helpful."

"That's an obvious setup by liberal parents. Like a 7 year old (in 2013) would be paying attention to politicians. Besides, many diseases are inherited or due to diet or other activities. Why do you think your doctor asks for your family history and other habits? This is just another way liberals do more harm than good in the black community."
"Remember the big muscular cop that worked at a school and threw a slightly built young black lady and her desk across the room? And for the horrible crime of refusing to hand over her cell phone! I had a lady, whom I used to admire; try to justify the violent assault on that child by that cop. I know damn well if it had happened to one of her grandchildren she would have moved heaven and earth to get that cop fired and punished. Yet, because the child assaulted was black, she it trying to excuse the behavior of that jerk in uniform. Yes America, we are full of racists! They are your friends, family, and co-workers! What are we going to do about it?"
"As readers will recall, the black martyr, Michael Brown, committed strong-arm robbery after getting stoned;  then proceeded to walk down the middle of a busy street with his lying (hands up, don't shoot) accomplice;  when a policeman asked them to move to the sidewalk, Brown assaulted the officer and tried to steal the officer's gun;  in the struggle the gun discharged in the officer's car;  then Brown left the car and ran away only to come back and charge the officer;  Brown was shot.

After the incident, the officer had to go into hiding because of numerous death threats;  later, after an investigation which revealed the above-noted facts, it was determined that the officer acted lawfully.

The ""protests"" referred to in this column also included rioting where black mobs looted and burned numerous stores.

Brown has become one of the many ""martyrs"" of BLM as well as figures like Colin Kaepernick."
"Maher is the perfect person to do just the opposite of what he does and says.  He is the model of what NOT to do.  Funny?  Yeah, he is very funny sometimes.  But he hides behind his being a ""comedian"" whenever he goes too far and gets in trouble, which is pretty often.  His racist comments recently about blacks is just one of many things he wished he never said.  Atheist, socialist, racist and hypocrite is the way to describe him in my opinion.  I'll bet he was pummeled as a kid by just about everyone, even the girls.  I can see him running all over the school playground with a bunch of people wanting to kick his butt for saying stupid things!!  On his show if the audience doesnt laugh at his sick jokes he gets mad.  LOL!  That says it all in my opinion."
"Sessions will get the nod as Attorney General. Sessions prior life in Alabama was not a bowl of cherries but he hasn't demonstrated anything that could construed as racist. I think the better term would be "" politically motivated"" that was unfair to the black people. He did threaten to lock up those 3 black protesters for a very long time so yeah, he used it as a tool for intimidation. We'll see what kind of spine he has while in office with Trump as president."
"I used to do a bird mortality count for Coast Watch at Shi Shi and one of the women in the group had her van broken into while she slept in it. The young braves were drunk and tried to talk her into going to a party with them. She agreed, then ditched them as soon as they got back into Neah. 

While picking up litter at Bahahobash Point I came across a group of six young braves, one of whom wanted to fight me immediately. A young chief saved my life likely by saying he liked that I was picking up trash. If I hadn't had that big black bag of garbage in my hands I might have been in that car. There's lots of anger out there, and justifiably so, but I don't go out on the reservation alone anymore."
Walt Weiss could have done just as well - and without all the hype Black has received this season.
"That's not true.

""Republicans have cut deals with opposing black Democratic state legislators to create majority-black districts. By packing black Democratic voters into a single district, they can essentially ensure the election of a black Congressman or re-election of a black state legislator due to the packed concentration of Democratic voters. However, the surrounding districts are more safely Republican in areas like the South, where white conservatives have increasingly shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party in national elections in the last four decades.""

""Bipartisan gerrymandering refers to redistricting that favors the incumbents in both the Democratic and Republican Parties.

"Trump said during the election, Chicago has been thoroughly democrat for 30 years: sheriff, mayor, police chief, school boards, and most of the public services are Democrat / black controlled.

"I do not go to the game to be subjected to players or others taking advantage of me as a captive audience, paying a lot to be entertained, not to be subjected to a few players deciding to use that  forum for their personal political views, whatever those views may be. I keep hearing this is their right. What about my right. Can I go to the stadium with others and protest like the players do or would I be thrown out of the stadium?

How about Michael Bennett's lies about what happened to him in California when he said the police held a gun to his head and they stopped him because he was black etc. The video of all of it showed he ran from the police and was held for about 10 minutes until they could determine he was not the gun bearer that had been reported to the police. No gun was held to his head or any other part of his body. He said he was fearful for his life. Also, not supported by the evidence. Yet he sits in disrespect claiming his statement that blacks are mistreated."

"""According to Ms. Clinton, minorities will stick together but women won't – which explains why Barack Obama could be elected but not her. ""Race is a much more motivating factor for voters than gender is,"" she told Matt Lauer.""

I find this comment telling.  For the first time, Clinton implied that it was race that resulted in her defeat.  Millions of registered Democrats not voting.  Obama supporters.  A critical voting bloc that failed to show up in spite of Obama frequently on the campaign trail attempting to rally support for Clinton.  Was it the black African male placing pressure on black African females not to vote.  Did other women voters of colour face the same pressure? This would suggest a conspiracy or social pressure to prevent this from happening as seen in war torn areas of the Middle East where women are on a lower status of humanity.

The issues of intellectually unprepared clerics, for example, is true of those in the Philippines, some parts of Africa and India as well, but that is not an unknown and the bishops conferences in those countries are starting to focus on the issue (Cardinal Tagle, for one, is very concerned about it).   I am more positive about our crops of ministers, both men and women, and the great influx of the laity in the roles of ministers and theologians and canonists.  This is why most religious are not overly concerned about our future: we see emerging models of new health and strength and spirituality, and a breaking free of the church-imposed shackles places on so many (women and the laity).   There is much to be hopeful for."

How did I ""look like a Nazi""? Because a lot of people know someone of ethnic German background when they see them."
"Where are you on the scale 0-5?

5 - (true believer) - Man-made Climate Change – catastrophic – need to tax CO2 and redistribute money to poor countries to help them deal with the issue

4 - Man-made Climate Change – harmful – need to lower global CO2 through regulations and by subsidizing low carbon technologies

3 - Man-made global warming – somewhat harmful – need to find ways to adapt and continue to study

2 - Some global warming – partially man-made, partially natural, but not significant enough to cause concern  

1 - Some global warming – natural causes

0 - (denier) - No global warming"
"Stop letting such a thing as your skin colour define you.   You are not marginalized unless you think you are.   I certainly would never marginalize you nor anyone I know.   If you were invited there because you are black that is wrong and you should have said so, if you were invited there because you are a promising writer with obvious talent....way to go!!  :)  I hope you blossom into a magnificent writer that can also speak about 'all' people and not define yourself to such a silly degree by the colour of your skin (it is a form of racism and you notice it in silly groups like BLM).    

Just so you know the victim business is exhausting for the rest of us...believe me.    Sorry your father had to deal with such a racist country and be kicked out for not being black enough.   That is wrong.  Just be wonderful you."
Better article nobody would make: Can Black American fix their relationship with America?
"This response is so sick it should be funny. But it is actually prophetically scary.
I am ""inflaming the anxieties of the vulnerable and marginalized"" when I warn them that the big bad guys who hate them are on their way with sticks, stones and cudgles.  Next comes ""Strange Fruit"" for muslims as well as blacks. 
Remember the term: ""state sponsored terrorism"".  No longer ""over there"" but ""right here"".  Stand now people - ""should, woulda coulda"" is no excuse; turns no clock back.
If ""you"" are Jesus in time Church, that time is now."
"Gave you a ""like"", EKBlack, although I take exception to your characterization of Obama's strategy as "" incredibly sensitive but confused, milquetoast approach"" to terrorism.  Really?   Black Ops and drone warfare is milquetoast?  Incredibly sensitive?  Hundreds of innocent civilians killed abroad because Obama STEPPED UP drone warfare initiated by Bush?  I would say it was ""politically motivated"" for sure--hey, a low-risk substitute for ""boots on the ground"" which nooooobody in the U.S. wanted any more."
"Today showcases how some liberals are the worst of the worst . Legislators boycotting a ceremony because they disagree with a person's position on issues is as low as it gets . John Lewis is the head dirtbag. He calls our president-elect a non-legitimate president.  When Trump fights back saying he ought to spend his time working harder on his home district that is hurting--poor John Lewis plays the victim . Typical liberal.   Though Trump won't do it , if i were him I'd look for payback and make a list of these poor losers and cut funding to their districts.  When Obama was asked about the boycott he could have called on these legislators to act as one America on this day--but true to form Obama sided with his black legislators and refused to comment. Today there is new hope for America . If Trump is able to do for America what he has done for himself and family---we will all become great again.  Just imagine an America with peace and prosperity for all.  Trump has a dream--our dream."
"In other words, you don't want to explain why you aren't a racist.  But liberals have no problem calling me one when it fits.  people do falsely claim racism to stifle debate.  And I have no desire to shut you up, just to quit lying about me.  If you need to lie, then you have no argument to make.  Now, about using black people, that's all liberals do.  They have deceived themselves into thinking their policies help and that blacks care about statues. 
  I provide evidence from the mouths of blacks that reject liberal policies because it is real.  Not to score political points.  BTW, there are no political points to score on this forum."
"Radir wants to be transported to a time when all those blacks, women, gays, etc. knew their places."
"I agree that people vote in terms of the benefit of greater society, or at least in terms of what benefits them individually, but people still have their own, individual political agency. So, in the DA and in the ANC, for example, members should be allowed to disagree and vote against motions with which they do not agree. Also, I don't agree with referring to, say, black people as ""masses"", as I see people as individuals with their own unique situations. One cannot generalise about black people, just as one cannot speak for all black people. Thus, people should be treated as individuals. I hope you agree with me."
"You need to catch up on your history before making remarks such as these otherwise you risk making a mockery of yourself.  There are many good books on the history of islam.  I suggest reading one that was published before 1950 so as to quell any concern you might have over who attacked who first, which with islam does not matter.  You may find it interesting that in 1786 Muslim ships were harassing American ships off what is now the US Seaboard.  At that time the US Navy had just three ships.  The American Government decided it best to pay them a bribe to avoid having their colonists abducted and returned to Africa to be sold as slaves, which is what these muslims were interested in doing.  So a bribe was paid and the Barbary Corsairs returned to the Mediterranean.  Does this constitute a first attack?  If so then muslims attacked the USA first."
"Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III scrambled aboard the ‘Trump train’ early, because Trump seemed like his best chance for a position where he could really abuse all those uppity people of color / women / liberals with impunity. And Donald J. Trump welcomed the Malevolent Leprechaun aboard, because he assumed that their shared revanchist social goals would keep ol’ Jeff from looking too closely at Don’s myriad ethical peccadilloes."
"I hope the governor sticks to his word! It's time to take these people off the bottle and give all equal treatment. Have to treat everybody equal! If the country /state cuts all the Free unearned benefits, people will figure out how to get by. This state need EEO and more opportunity for all. I got turned down at South Central foundation for a job because the the human resources lady told me, ""you don't qualify because your not native"". Exact words, No lie. The alaskan economy is tumbling down from enabling these people with free health care, free money and a job regardless if the person is qualified or not! I'm a life long alaskan and had to join the army for college. It's irritating to see natives cry wolf everyone it's time to develop. These people are rarely educated and the state can't keep up with the world's economy. If anybody deserves free $ I would have to say African Americans because they did more labor for this country than anybody. Not big racist, just speaking facts!"
That's a pretty good impression of BO. Now do the one where he has his sleeves rolled up when he was stumping for Hillary.Ya know where he says that if the African Americans didn't vote for Hillary he would take it personally. Great times.THAT'S immortal .
hard times for most. but you wonder where do they get the energy to mate for another...?
"Please, you forgot African Canadians........................"
"""The New Jim Crow"" by Michelle Alexander would enlighten the unaware readers regarding why BLM has these planks in their platform.  The book outlines how zero tolerance policies, ""check the box"" requirements and emphasis on law and order are selectively applied to African Americans, and have devastated employment prospects and economic enfranchisement of the black community."
"Finally a comment that considers the plight of this young man that brought him to this place.  There are too many like him that start life out in the negative digits.   Some people that start life way below others do make it in life & don't become murderers, but I don't think this is the norm. I read about two boys that were black (which was already a strike against them) that were in prison.  Both their IQs were really low. Doesn't mean that their IQ was that low to begin with. There is something disturbing when you hear that one young man was passed around for sex to his buddies by his step-father. The other boy's mom sat him on a hot burner on the stove to punish him for being a bad boy. I guess this taught him to not behave! Yeah, right. It doesn't mean that they should go free, but I guess I can feel some compassion for people like this due to their circumstances. Also, statements like ""I was treated badly and I turned out okay."" You weren't born with his basic traits."
"I know whose restaurants I won't knowingly eat in. I am a man with money to spend, but obviously, she does not seek my patronage. She insults all men and thinks its good for business?  Do  her male staff at Black Hoof, and Grey Gardens, know how much she begrudges them?"
"Yeah, just imagine if a black man did this. He probably would have been shot dead."
"Golly Gee Whizz Batman how solve smash and grabs and the local Bang Bang store .. Require reinforced concrete fronts perhaps vehicle stop stones or concrete blocks out front , like at any secure building Target has them in shape of Red Balls , this might be fighting for Gun Stores as well .. A two foot guard rail around the side and back of store . Prevent side and or rear access .. They need to be a bit more secure than a Clothing Consignment store they do deal in death after all be it for furry Animals, birds and or "" Bad Gun Owners""  .. They are Local Gun depots not convenience stores.. we have to treat them as such . This is a place of business that sells weapons that can be used in a wide variety of ways . Some legal others not . It's my theory that many not all smash and grabs are insurance scams and the guns stolen are then sold on the Black Market . A win , win for everybody in the Gun business and the straw buyer then is bypassed entirely . Big Money for everyone"
"It certainly makes sense for Ms. Knight to insist people identify her as black, by virtue of her mother's origin.  That way, she gets to claim the many benefits and entitlements of victimhood.  If Ms. Knight were identified as South Asian - not entirely unreasonably since that's her father's origin - she'd be just another un-special person who would have to make her way in the world based on merit."
"Don't know how you made the assumption that I think racism does not exist. It does, and it is not going to be lessened by the university building a hide-away for black students."
"Dirty cops are all day, every day. So you're saying that the black community is causing (by ordering) police to contact them. I guess the solution is to get the black community to order police to stand down. Why are women more inclined to be raped? What is it that women are doing to make themselves be victims. I'm sure you have the answer. Help society out with the answer."
"Black, a convicted criminal, was issued a 1 year visitor visa by Harper in 2012. Criminals aren't normally allowed into Canada but Harper wasn't bothered by his fraud conviction because he's sympathetic to the rightwing cause.  Black gave up his citizenship, called Canada a backwater, then begged to be let in.  His visa should be up by now.  Who keeps extending it?"
"Nine years into our ""recovery"" the only group who have not benefitted from the ""growth"" are working people. Their wages continue to be depressed. Corporations have piles of money and the rich continue to get pull away economically. These conditions have been brewing for over thirty years. A large cohort of profoundly anxious people, who are not necessarily the economy's losers, chose to express their poorly understood and articulated angst by electing an incompetent to the presidency, just to create confusion. They blame the same people who did what their parents or grandparents did, that is immigrate to this country. They become ever more tribal as they look for new people to blame - in addition to - liberals, African Americans, Mexicans, immigrants, agnostics, LGBTs, while not comprehending the real causes for their condition. They flail impotently as they elect people who have literally no interest in making their lives better."

"So native Hawaiians are doing as bad or better than black Americans. This is because native Hawaiians tend to be poorer than their non-native peers, and because living healthfully in Hawaii is expensive. Seems like there are two options if you can't make it work in a certain area: move, or get more money. Seeing as how most of the social welfare programs designed to benefit native Hawaiians are more of a hand-out than a hand-up, the second choice probably won't work very well. Maybe they should move out of state in order to get the higher quality of life they need."
"IDK... she's black, so...."
"What pisses me off more is the fact that the BLM can do more they just choose not too , I do understand about managing the herds and when I said to feed them is by putting hay on the government land not just in there holding pins so there not taking all the grazing from the ranchers for there cows it is that little extra that might make a difference but who am I to say I am just a woman in a man's world ."
"Way to early to rush to judgment. Did she yell her boyfriend had a gun and then did the man refuse the order to ""not reach for it?""
This may be another indefensible shooting, but perhaps not: it's too early to tell.
Here's what we know: the policeman approached a car at 9:00 at night; the driver and passengers were black. 
There is some confusion over when and how the police were advised the man was armed. Also, when- or whether- the policeman ordered the man to freeze.
Before condemning all cops, let's look at facts that play into these situations: a. Black areas are much more violent than any other; b. Black men have an extremely high murder rate. Ask yourself if, knowing this, you as an officer would not be extremely nervous/on edge upon approaching and interacting with a black person in a darkened vehicle at night. And no, there is no ""training"" that prepares an officer to let himself be shot before he shoots.
This is NOT condoning the shooting. It is putting this in some context."
"Orange, as opposed to 1/3 black?"
"Congrats to the Pride community for standing up for principle!
In the LGBT community, and especially in the black community, police power is often correctly seen as abusive and designed to protect property rather than people. Systemic racism in policing has been well established for two decades, and marginalized communities feel it.
Apoplectic critics such as this editorialist who moan about spending public money on Pride should think a) that the police don't need protection, b) that Pride is a huge community event featuring minority populations, and c) that the taxpayer can save the money the TPS would spend on float and booth propaganda.
Gay and lesbian cops who want to participate will still be welcome, I'm sure."
"There are a lot of factors that lead to the number of black professional athletes, but racism by team management isn't one of them.


Except in your mind, of course.  No surprise there."
Contrast this with what happens if a crazy black person goes on a rampage and gets shot and killed by police.  No riots.  No calls of racism.  No crazy marches and calls to fire policemen.  Hmm.

"President Trump did not shy away from the fact that our country was getting dissed by losers. We respect him also for his patriotism. I got a news flash for you.
The race and the great divide was started by the illegitimate term of a non eligible Kenyan that just because of his color and not to piss off the black race won. 
I didn't vote for him because he admitted he was a Muslim and then he denied it. But his book ""Dreams of my father"", or ""The audacity of hope"" proves my point. If he is willing to take the Muslim side then he is a Muslim.
I wouldn't have voted for him anyway. I stand in the Conservative camp and always have.
You liberals don't love America cause if you did you wouldn't try and burn it down everytime you have a protest.
If you don't love it, Leave it!!"
"There are more firearms in the USA today than ever and yet the gun crime rate has been going down.

 http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/05/14/disarming-realities-as-gun-sales-soar-gun-crimes-plummet/#7c97705d7de9

The March Pew study, drawn from numbers obtained from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also found a dramatic drop in gun crime over the past two decades. Their accounting shows a 49 percent decline in the homicide rate, and a 75 percent decline of non-fatal violent crime victimization. More than 8 in 10 gun homicide victims in 2010 were men and boys. Fifty-five percent of the homicide victims were black, far beyond their 13 percent share of the population."
"Is it really about systemic racism.   About systemic racism- it is more prevalent in Chicago where black on black crime is out of control. Chicago is a city run by liberals. Accessing higher education, entrepreneurial spirit, capitalism and free market principles, two parent homes and not having a child until married are the best ways to fight systemic racism. Sybil Jordan Hampton overcame systemic racism in Little Rock, Ar, by persevering while attending Central High, the high school forced to integrate in 1957.  Jordan earned a bachelor’s degree from Earlham College in Indiana, a master’s degree in elementary education at the University of Chicago, and a master’s and doctorate from the Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City. No one spoke to her during her three years at Central High and she was spat upon and kicked. but she went on to receive numerous awards and honors. She was named to Arkansas Business’s Top 100 Women in Arkansas.  That's how you overcome racism."
"I frankly don't recall ever meeting a black person, where the discussion that followed, wasn't all about them. And that's exactly what I'm feeling about Rep. Frederica Wilson. As it appears that she simply cannot get enough of herself."
"Well, if BLM is a success in getting cops to shoot fewer black people, and NFL loses some dollars? I'd call that a more than fair trade in the interest of progress. 


If you were a parent of a child that is at risk of being shot by cops for no particular reason than for having the ""wrong"" skin color, I think you'd prioritize BLM over the bottom line of those within the NFL.


I know it's only natural that cons value profit over people, but seriously, try to walk a mile in another's shoes, even if it's only as a mental exercise."
"No, they cannot be applied to the same people who don't want women to have careers.

There is an eternity of difference between a Sacrament, in this case Holy Orders and some secular career path. The difference is so big, you are not comparing Apples to Oranges, but Apples to stars.  

The Sacrament of Holy Orders isn't just another career path and it isn't just about whether women should get to be leaders and make decisions.  It is far more than that.  This is the whole problem with feminists.  They have to turn every discussion into ""But you just want women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen being slaves to their husbands"" bit.

That is like calling someone a racist just because they disagree with something a black person said."
"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals. Nothing has been done to keep blacks from voting, only to keep anyone not entitled to vote from voting. There is no evidence that voting ID laws have had any impact on anyones ability to vote."

"pissedoffMarine, I agree with you 100%. This disrespect for our symbols of freedom are a slap in the face to all soldiers and American patriots. Who the hell do they think supports this game? Without a fan base; the team is nothing. The Broncos' fans are the most loyal in the country. They are loved whether they win or lose. This B.S. will ruin this team, if allowed to continue. My heart is broken to see this insane behavior condoned. Elway could take lessons from a more experienced owner, Jerry Jones. Of course, Texans are unique. They love AMERICA. Jerry Jones said emphatically ""Stand up or be fired. You will no longer be part of this team."" I believe all Cowboy players are relieved that they have no choice. They don't have to be bullied into being sheep because they are black. If they do not honor the Flag and National Anthem, no paycheck; contract cancelled. How easy would it be for all owners to keep the focus on football & tell them to go do this on their own time; not at work!"

"Several councillors mentioned how today many black person still suffer the emotional scars of slavery of 300 years ago. I fail to see how the gay men of Toronto should atone for either the slavery or the immaturity of people claim to be lingering victims of it. The African slave trade is still on going in Arabic/Muslim countries, but nobody at BLM wants to talk about that."
"""If I was racist I wouldn't live in the neighborhood."" Yes because clearly it take ""most liberal"" person to be willing to  live around brown and black people.

Rap creation was funded by high level freemasons to destroy the black culture. In the past black families were close and religious. That needed destroyed.

"Hey black dude, complete the reasoning.  If you watch violent porn and then abuse a lady, your watching was not out of mere curiosity. It was out curiosity to abuse.  If you watch the dark room whatever and then kill as they do, it was of curiosity to, add the to, there is a to, to imitate them."
"1/ I finally got around to reading that letter from the Seymour Institute. The black pastors make some good points, and I'm sympathetic to their dismay at the abortion rate in the black community but ultimately at odds with their paternalistic demand that Clinton present a solution specific to black women. Like the Catholic Church, the black church fails to persuade women to reject abortion and so turns to the government to coerce. As you know, I reject that approach.

The letter also features the standard conservative overreaction to Clinton's remarks about changing religious norms. These have been decontextualized from a speech concerning educational opportunities for girls (a point that has been made repeatedly in these threads and predictably greeted with crickets). It is simply histrionic to decry efforts to improve education and opportunities for girls and women as ""totalitarian."""
"In Matthew 7:16-20, Jesus said, ""You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles? In the same way, every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears bad fruit. A good tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit. Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits.""

If Trump is the tree, the tree is already diseased, and the fruit that has so far been borne (his cabinet picks) are already showing signs of disease. Frankly, I don't care how many correct church boxes these cabinet picks check, by their fruits we shall know them and those of us who did not vote for the diseased tree will be watching and waiting to see what kind of fruit they bear in terms of policy. I doubt much of it will be anything of which Jesus would approve. But we shall see. And we shall comment accordingly."

"Palatable, handle the diction duties and provide a suitable word replacement. BTW, hate is not the argument. Instead, it's that there is no known problem with transgenders serving in the military. Over and over we've seen your kind say that allowing blacks, women, gays, et al., serve in the military would cause a significant problem, yet these people have served and there is no problem. So Trump's ban on transgender in the military is the problem. Again, it's the Trump's bans that are the problem. Get your GED and learn to understand what you read."
"Actually, you should check out the real history on that. It wasn't Christians that made the laws that forced individual businesses in the south to discriminate against blacks. It was the government that made those laws. Go on, read a book!"
"It's the law. You can't discriminate against a couple solely because they are gay or lesbian.
Anymore than you can discriminate against blacks or Roman Catholics or disabled people.
If skinheads want meat from a kosher butcher, and they are polite customers, they have every right to be served. If they harass the butcher, that's criminal behavior.

"Are you kidding me ?   Where's the guys and gals with all the anti-Trump names who comment on here ?  The million dollar question in all this is : why do they and many of you fight so hard against something that will help keep us safe in America ? Trumps ban was meant to keep us safe . What's wrong with that ?  Who's side are you on ?    People try to say this ban won't keep us safe , and that building a wall won't stop all the illegals----BUT , it will stop some of them, and that's a big help.  To all those who claimed this ban was anti-Muslim , ask yourselves--if that was the case , why didn't he ban the three largest Muslim countries ?  Average people--those of us who comment on here-- can disagree on issues and it's just open debate.  However , when people who are trained in the law like judges , intentionally make decisions simply because they want to resist Trump , make incorrect decisions--they should be removed from the courts. Liberal judges appear to want to destroy America ."
"What is multiculturalism, and why is it bad.  This country has had St Patrick's Day parades (the Irish), Columbus day parades (the Italians), Christmas and Easter (the Christians), Passover and Hanukkah (Jewish), Cinco de Mayo (Hispanic) for decades.  Isn't that celebrating multiculturalism.  And what is identity politics but groups with like interests, culture, race banding together to help advance themselves in America.  Being part of the civil rights movement you should recognize that the movement actually was identity politics - working to get blacks equal rights.  And because a group works for equal treatment under the law or celebrates their heritage does not mean that the reject their identity as Americans.  It means they are working for the American dream.  And Dean when you try to connect liberals with Marxists you are more guilty of identity politics than any group that is working for equal rights."
"A petulent crowd of facebookies and twitterites only, not even decency to show support for democracy but go on like a highschool clique making some big statement.

Millions of men in every neighbourhood together molesting willingly ingangs.Trump is not going to put up with it as you all did. children dont even know what childhood is. Obama the only black  president who reintroduced human slavery to the americas and his could care less women just partying while so much suffer. Bandwagoners."
I understand the history Jefferson davis.  but would somebody please tell me what the hail Obama did for blacks except stoke more racism. .  Even Louis farrakhan in his constant praise for Obama states basically Obama didn't didn't do grass digested  by a cow !!!! but the reason he didn't do anything is because there's nothing to do.  blacka just like everybody else in this country are not living under Jefferson davis law.
"If you go over to Duck U, there is a place called Deady Hall.  Sometimes, that causes people to ask ""Who was Deady"".  

You then discover a founder of Duck U who wrote a Constitution forbidding Negroes to live in the State and forbidding slavery.  You also discover that later, as a Judge, he defended Chinese when they were being discriminated against.  

With no name on the building, as a passerby, you would never discover any such thing.

There are statues to Caligula, one of the most vile Romans in history.  ""Who was Caligula?"" is less likely to happen without such a statue.

"I know I am about to make a comment on the problem that is going to make all the REAL racists to go nuclear.  Here it is:  The wage gap is the fault of the black men.  For these 4 reasons:  1) they pursue degrees that aren't worth as much  2)  They have a higher incarnation rate 3) they are 40 times more likely to commit a violent crime and 4) they have a sense of entitlement that isn't earned.      People would like to add ""discrimination"" but think about that.  Hasn't the criminal behavior and violent tendencies enough to make an employer shy?  So..... WWYD?  I never hesitated to hire anyone when I ran a business and didn't see any who worked for me behave poorly, very few blacks applied but they were accepted and worked well.  But the figure I used came from the DOJ.  Not my personal experience."
"The problem is we won't know if they are real cops marching or pretend cops, like that guy in the Village People. I guess you didn't think about that, did you?

(Blacks are 13% of the US population but 40% of the prison population - what percentage of those blacks in prison are innocent? Is it more than zero?)"
"Probably better than Duck U's!  

Duck U graduates suck at getting jobs according to the same site.  25% can't get a lawyer job after 7 years of 'education' which rates in the ""bottom 20%"" to comparable law schools according to this independent source.  

Total minority out of 366 is 67, if you care.  Only 9 blacks, if you care.  

""Graduates of University of Oregon School of Law mainly take the bar in Oregon and Washington.
In these two states, its graduates did 2.8% worse on average than all graduates from all law schools taking the exam in the same two states.""  

This means University of Oregon School of Law doesn't do a good job of preparing its students for the bar exam in these states.""

That's the part I care about.

Trump U 'education' is bad.  Duck U Law School 'education' is bad; maybe worse compared to their peers."
"And since the real pervasive slaughter of black men is perpetrated by other black men, nothing will really change for the better. You could weed out every racist cop in the world and the slaughter will continue. Take a look at Chicago."
"A very sad case. Meredith was one of the few community leaders who  publicly spoke of the root cause of so much Black crime - mostly Black on Black crime. He came out and boldly stated that the fatherless youth caused buy a  single Mom/many fathers culture was the biggest contributor to troubled communities. Of course, the politically correct media never embraced that truth - as clear as it might be for many of the actors - police, social workers, child welfare. It makes me want to scream and pull my hair out - that we refuse to help these communities and kowtow to racist groups like Black Lives Matter."
"Believe it or not I think you're partly right.  If you'd left out ""And black privilege is very evident in UO athletics, is it not?"" you'd have been all right.  But with your last baiting of your ideological opponents you push things so far that you lose all validity."
"Americans seem to be paralyzed by fuzzy concepts of ""intergenerational guilt."" I have no responsibility for any acts committed by others, especially for acts committed by past generations. Agonizing over past real or perceived injustices done to American Indians, Negroes, etc. is wasted emotion which serves primarily to confuse people & divert attention from valid current issues."
"So much better to just ignore cops killing blacks, right fiveo?  They deserve it.  We just want to watch a football game and get drunk.  So very American.   

If God did have a hand in the founding, he or she must be shaking their head like crazy today.  

How could a country get away from God so much where violance is tolerated and actually celebrated each week?  So very Christian."
"Boy, G&M sure dropped this story off their front page in a hurry. Just another act of propaganda by connivance."
"I don't want ""balance "" from Trump. I want him to bulldoze the establishment swamp that is destroying what is left of America. That's but just another of those nice-sounding word weapons the left loves to abuse in order to manipulate people--like sensitivity, bipartisanship, compromise, maverick, women's rights, and homophobe, etc."
"Wait. Just wait. 

Orange will indeed be the new black."
"Alright, look, if a program is aimed at racial discrimination, does that make the program itself racist? In the case of affirmative action, those programs were designed to counter a racial bias in college admissions of primarily black students capable of doing the coursework but with lower test scores, generally thought to be the result of inferior K-12 schools underfunded because they are in poor neighborhoods. Remember, most public schools are locally funded, so rich neighborhoods have rich schools, poor neighborhoods have poor schools.

The intent of racism is to keep certain races down. Admissions criteria favor applicants from more affluent areas with better schools. In states where a third of the people are black, for instance, why is it that only a tenth or twentieth of public university admissions are black students? That is a racist result that causes harm to black communities and perpetuates poverty, a situation that's bad for our nation. That's why AA programs aren't racist."
"President Obama's legacy has been a debt-fueled recovery at home, and chaos overseas. A master of public presentation, he always sounded and looked more together than he ever was. The decisive moments of his presidency include the bail outs of the financial services industry and backdoor bail-outs to the world's central banks (including Canada's), implementing the flawed Obamacare health reforms, and the long war against America's enemies in order to keep the dollar afloat. Being half black was never the great accomplishment or landmark as some claimed: America has long had blacks in high levels of office and that has never changed the fundamentals relating to black social and family failure."
"There was an interesting article about a decade ago, in Vietnam Magazine, that dispels that whole black soldier thing.  Actually government statics show that their percentage of the in country force and their casualty rate was close to equal to their percentage of the U.S. population of african americans."
"Here's a thought experiment to put fake-Indian mascots into perspective.

Imagine there is a newly built high school in Berlin, and in the manner of Americans they want to choose a mascot for the school.  They decide to choose ""Jews"" to be the mascot.  On game days people like to wear Yamulkes and fake peyos and long black jackets.  They have game chants that are supposed to sound vaguely like Hebrew or Yiddish.  Given the history of Germany is this appropriate or not?  Do you see parallels to American history?  Discuss!"
"I recall seeing a news item on ""diversity"" where a black fellow who was a systems analyst was able to 'solve the problem'. Hooray and all that. 

The only problem was that as I listened to 'the problem', it was the sort of thing any competent systems analyst (regardless of colour, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) would have been able to solve. 

See, there are some IT problems that simply involve understanding what the problem is (often it is something like, ""We need to track the number of service calls our service reps make each week.""), knowing where the data is and then coming up with a way to get the data to where you want it to be. 

Sure, go ahead and advocate for 'diversity' (and certainly hire based on a person's ability). But recognize that 'reserving X number of seats for THIS group' because of 'unconscious bias' may mean you aren't hiring the best qualified people.  

btw, I wonder if the author runs an 'Equity Consulting' business?"

"If Trump never brought it up and made a unilateral decision that he didn't even consult with his top Generals about (not just ""his generals"" whomever that might have been....General Motors?  Maybe he talked to his car.), then this would not be in the news and transgendered people would fade into the background, serving alongside other men and women.  Think about 70 years ago....after Truman integrated the military, what if suddenly the next president said, ""No, black people can't serve in the same units anymore.""  Do you even think there wouldn't be attention drawn to that issue?

I think you're right - people should keep their private lives to themselves.  However, this ""president"" messed the situation up.  He's the guy who LOVES drawing attention to himself, remember?"
"So in this case, ""compromise"" means liberty for the baker, not for the customer. In other words, as I said, liberty for me, not for thee.

Given that the baker's idea of ""religious liberty"" means ""the liberty to discriminate against gays""; I would say that the Christian religion, which does NOT say ""love your neighbor, unless that neighbor is LGBT"", would call on him to serve the customer.

I believe that to practice arbitrary discrimination is a far greater sin than being homosexual. I see no difference whatsoever between a baker who would not bake for blacks and one who would not bake for gays. Both are perverting the Christian religion by claiming that their ""religious liberty"" would be damaged by doing so. Both bakers are bigots, ""justifying"" their bigotry in the name of religion."

"""It gives the message that the primary purpose of marriage is sexual satisfaction...""  Wrong.  Such a judgmental statement is in ignorance of how anyone and everyone chooses to marry: it is out of love, and one way that love is expressed is through the intimacy of sexual union.  Terms like ""Divine Will"" and ""attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage..."" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which ""long held"" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility."

"tRump and his advisors, Bannon, Conway, Miller and others, have played the American people to the point that not even they know what the truth is., let alone their ardent supporters there and on these comment boards.

They must know the end id near for their hero.

""Before they seize power and establish a world according to their doctrines, totalitarian movements conjure up a lying world of consistency which is more adequate to the needs of the human mind than reality itself; in which. . .uprooted masses can feel at home and are spared the never-ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal to human beings and their expectations. The force possessed by totalitarian propaganda. . .lies in its ability to shut the masses off from the real world.""

"This article continues the NCR push-poll drumbeat, attempting to extrude out of the election a racist component in it, flatly ignoring the reality that far more blacks and Hispanics voted from Trump than they did for Romney or McCain.

Logic and facts, I realize, are expressions of micro-aggression.

The real ""shock"" that should be examined is ""black surprise that blacks/Hispanics crossed the tired Democratic line"".

Many blacks have finally given up on the pandering DNC that trots out every couple of years for black/inner city votes. 

There are 3,141 counties in the United States.

Trump won 3,084 of them.
Clinton won 57."
"I believe there is enough history of the leaders and those who primarily organize the protest under the banner of Black Lives Matters have clearly one objective which is meant to be as racially divisive as possible. I would note not every individual who attends the protest organized by BLM are willfully minded to be racially divisive, but it is a rather very poor group to be associated with."
"your source is an anti Muslim web site with no supportive information from police is Sweden.  Pants on fire lie.  What we’re hearing is a very, very extreme exaggeration based on a few isolated events, and the claim that it’s related to immigration is more or less not true at all,” says Jerzy Sarnecki, a criminologist at Stockholm University who has devoted his career to the study of criminality, ethnicity and age.

Sweden does indeed have far more reported cases of sexual assault than any other country. But it’s not because Swedes – of any colour – are very criminal. It’s because they’re very feminist. In 2005, Sweden’s Social Democratic government introduced a new sex-crime law with the world’s most expansive definition of rape.   The Globe and Mail Published Saturday, May 14, 2016 8:00AM EDT"
Read history books; put the monuments in a museum where they belong. Going to a public memorial shouldn't be how we educate ourselves. I learned yesterday that many of these monuments were placed during the jim crow era to intimidate newly freed black people. They have no place in civilized society.
"No one killed the Jews either....those in charge had instead determined that the Jews weren't fully humans.

Or the black slaves...they were only 3/5ths of a person.

When one is faced with a moral dilemma, just let one's intellect be co-opted. Get it to ""re-classify"" the thorny problem away.  The intellect's job is to classify and name things.  Easy peasy. 

That's what is so good about emotions...just let them get into the driver's seat, and they can make a lot of problems go away, or at least seemingly so.  The sadness returns, and the self-defensiveness and prickliness just grow!"
I have no problem using the term domestic terrorist. How about you in regards to the same label for BLM and Antifa? Can you say illegal alien or radical islam?
"As a concerned former HPD Officer, I see the department crumbling from within.  There seems to be no pride nor concern for outstanding IMAGE in the eyes of the public.  

I have witnessed an office serving as a special duty officer on Waialae Ave in Kaimuki without his uniform wearing shorts and a bulky vest with ""POLICE"" on the back of the bulky vest; a special duty officer sitting on his bag chair at the intersection of Woodlawn Drive and Alani Drive; an officer picking up his child at Stevenson Middle School in his black car with its blue light on...probably on duty at the time;  officers smoking while on duty in public; etc; etc; etc.

I guess the current mayor is either blind or not concerned with the negative image or the lack of pride exhibited by ""his"" police department and the obvious politically motivated inaction his is taking with Taketa.  It seem like most of the Commissioners are appointed because of a political favor or guarantee a large number of votes for the mayor."
"Sorry you fabricate a connection, Lazeelink (well named, by the way).

Murderers are indeed murderers, and hate crimes are hate crimes.  There are thousands of murders across the US every day.  There is no reasonable expectation that murderers are there to protect all citizens.

Sadly, for many Black Americans, there is also no reasonable expectation that the police in their jurisdiction are there to protect all citizens.  Last I looked, that's worth protesting, because elected government bodies might, if they gave a hoot, do something to fix that (since it is their responsibility).

Unless there is a remarkable sea change in US gun ownerships, there is precious little point in having protests against murders.  There might be a point in protesting unequal treatment of citizens by police officers.

So, yeah, you're engaging in whataboutism."
"Linda is correct. A law professor who says she does not know what blackface is, is either lying or incompetent."
"I'm torn on this issue. We have had season tickets in our family for over 50 years. I'd like to express my disappointment in what the players are doing, morso the black power salute than the kneeling.

I support the players' right to protest, and am trying to figure out how to protest their protest. For the Raiders' game, perhaps I should sell the tickets to Raiders' fans. I could probably get a tax break for supporting people who are clearly suffering from mental illness. But then those seats are still filled. So maybe I can just burn the tickets and allow the seats to stay unused. 

Another idea is a campaign to engage the NFL sponsors.  I hate to go down that road as I could be considered an NFL sponsor as well.  When the sponsors signed deals, they had no idea that this would happen. However, if Bud Light suddenly lost a ton of sales, perhaps that would send a message. 

We are now considering the idea of giving up our seats next season, with regret."
"It would be nice if half the space was set aside for park, it would probably connect with the existing 16 mile creek green space in Lions Valley park. One of the best parts of living in Oakville are the great trails. Having GA opened up would probably be a good thing in the long run. As others have said on here it's not like its the only good golf course in the GTA or nearby Hamilton."
Good luck getting into Black Lives Matter GBA-  I wonder if you can file a lawsuit for that.
"“very grateful the good Lord watched out for us”
Yep, Jesus was watching out for YOU but apparently didn’t give a damn about the 14 who died and about 130 who were injured. Do you even realize how offensive you are?"
"North Korea is enemy to only one country - U.S.A. They fought the Koran War of 1952 to a stalemate, still at war technically today. North Korea suffered horrific loss of 3 million dead from American carpet bombing similar to that of WW2. The U.S. 'took it out' on the Koreans after its army of several divisions under Gen. MacArthur was nearly wiped out by Chinese forces after trying to invade China. 

So the U.S. is both enemy of North Korea and China from this war. The U.S. is also enemy of Vietnam in the Vietnam War, and Cambodia and Laos after invading them. 3 million were killed in these 3 Asian countries, add the 3 million of North Korea and you have 6 million Asian dead from American imperial invasions since WW2. That's the same as the Nazi Holocaust on the Jews.

We know how the Vietnam War ended. All the weapons and forces the U.S. used did not win it after more than 12 years of horrific fighting including massive B-52 carpet bombing. 

So let's see Trump start Korean War 2."
Where's the racism in football? The majority of the players are black. And make millions of dollars to play the game not protest. You need serious help.
"Mr. Clark and Ms. Black are invited to learn more about the Republican perspective on arrearage at the upcoming Republican Roundup, starting at 4:00 PM, on Sept 17 at the Clallam County Fairgrounds.

He will be available to answer questions on this dead horse topic that seems to draw so much interest."
"He won't answer your question, John-- he likes that they ""did their homework"" in grilling a candidate with religious conviction made from a Conservative.  Of all the things to ask- of course they centered it around their [Christian]faith. The fact is that if the same ""homework"" were done on a Muslim/Black/fill-in-another-Leftist sponsored ""victim,"" he would summarily call such ""homework"" racist and uncalled for. You're absolutely right."
"In fact, American news reporters have been going into Yemen for some time now, both to cover the war and to document the famine. It is very difficult to do since Saudi Arabia forbids foreign entry into Yemen. It's also very dangerous.

You accuser the ""liberal media"" of neglecting this issue. Have you seen coverage of the famine from the ""conservative media"" which gets the majority of airtime, viewer hours, and talk radio exposure? I haven't. But I have seen coverage of the drought-caused famiine in South Sudan and the Horn of Africa, which are also VERY dangerous for anyone, let alone a Westerner, to go to and survive to tell the story. If those famines, whether caused deliberately by Saudi Arabia or by Mother Nature, held the attention of as many viewers as Trump and his family do, then we would see more news and discussion about it. Trump has now had 215 days in office to demand an end to the Yemen famine, which he could do. But instead, Trump has kissed the king's ring."
"This man is a coward & an oath breaker & the worst kind of human being imaginable because he incited & encouraged violence, blood shed & hatred over understanding, reason & logic.  

I blame him for his actions.  Not the BLM movement.  Not the police who killed the black men in LA, MN, or any other state.  Not the people who have been talking on social media.  No this is his fault.  I don't care how smart he may have been, he reacted stupidly & put people in danger.  

There's nothing to understand about why he committed these crimes.  It doesn't matter why because the answer is simple ""he believed he was right"". he wasn't.  If officials can't figure that out they aren't any smarter than the avg sheep. 

I believe in our country but we have to heal as a nation not fight as several.  We have to be willing to stand up for each other regardless of affiliation & connect with understanding & patience.  Not violence & protests. Cops don't write laws they're just doing a dangerous job."
"lol, what a joke Dems, talk about pot calling the kettle black....sorry you lost and will keep losing but that's just the way it is now."
"The Democrats under Obama's Presidency did nothing for black America. They just played identity politics, and this encourages the black community to blame others for their problems, which is a lot easier than taking personal responsibility for the issues and negative outcomes in their own society."
"Lies and leftist propaganda.  The country was 
NOT founded on slavery.  A very small portion of the population were slaves that were sold to Arab slave traders for a few trinkets and used all over the world, not just here.  The Civil war was about territory and resources like many wars.  Slavery was a by-product of that war.  Slavery was invented in Africa. More slavery goes on around the world today than the miniscule numbers here 100's of years ago.  Why don't you come up with a new leftist issue?"

"So much terrible violence was done by those awful liberal counter-protesters in Charlottesville.

There was the grusome beating of the Emancipation Park lawn by the feet of counter-protesters fleeing Richard Preston as he shot at them.

Then there was the despicable damage done to James Field's beautiful car by Heather Heyer's body and the bodies of 19 other vicious counter-protesters as he mowed them down in it.

And of course there is the impending dismantling of Robert E Lee's gorgeous metallic horsey-riding likeness, ending it's all too brief 93 year run of intimidating the black citizens of Charlottesville and celebrating Lee's unsuccessful attempt to destroy America and perpetuate slavery with a war that killed close to 1 million people.

We must stop these liberals from abusing our lawns with their feet as they flee gun violence, wrecking our cars with their bodies as we run them over and destroying our horsey-riding statues to our enemies' slavery-championing war heros!"
Lewis is a POLITICIAN and if Lewis enters the political arena he deserves everything he gets by Trump. What does the MLK holiday and his arrest 50 years have to do with what the old dinosaur says now? If Lewis doesn't want unwanted attention on all the poverty and black on black murders in his Georgia district then he should zip his mouth.
"More evidence that Trump is, in his heart of hearts, a con man. 

He looked right into the cameras and lied, and he shamelessly rode the birther whisper campaign and fed the delusions of those who refused to accept the legitimacy of the nation's first black president.

Now the carnival barker wants to move on, this con game is over. On to the next. It was Hillary's fault he tells us. She's the birther, just ask Breitbart.

Shameless but not unexpected."
"I believe the problem in Chicago is much the same as in most over sized cities. Too many folks and not enough jobs! To blame blacks for not reforming or policing themselves is an empty notion. No culture that I'm aware off, ever polices itself. Kind of the same thing that most professions won't police themselves either!  A crazy world, huh?"

"Racism is more prevalent in black communities than anywhere.  I worked for several large corporations and we hired the best for the position,  Color or sex didn't matter - we wanted to make money and wanted the best.  Africa is primarily black and contributes a whopping 1% annually to the world's wealth.  Blacks in the US are about 10-13% of thepopulati0n and contribute less than 4% of the economy.  However, they do suck dry the people who work and produce."

"It is a total misuse of the word apartheid.  My law Professor was from South Africa, and every time he hears the word associated with Israel....he goes rank.  Israeli policy is NOTHING LIKE APARTHEID, there is NO comparison..... no more apartheid than the US is with its treatment of blacks.  It may not be ""fair"" or desirable....and in Israel's case i M not conceding that point....BUT, NOT apartheid."
"Perhaps, but the important question is will the US ever be free of this malignant, nepotistic incompetent? She darkens any ray of hope like a blackout curtain, waiting to extinguish any and all forms of light like the sad, attention addicted cat lady she has become. She lost one nomination to an unknown, and a general election to an emospastic buffoon that admits to groping women and hating brown people? What possible use can there be in allowing her to suck any more precious oxygen from the already toxic atmosphere that is Dumberikkka? If she will not go on her own she should be put to pasture."
"Ineed, intent is, IMO, very important in this incident and every incident of behavior which smacks of racism, misogyny, homophobia, or any other bias, discrimination or perceived""hate speech.""  To contend otherwise is, in my view, as clueless as Ms. Shurtz's wearing blackface.  

President Schill is bending to the political climate on the U of O campus.  To me this doesn't represent leadership, but rather cowardice.  The most extreme factions on campus are demanding Ms. Shurtz's resignation or dismissal.  Schill supports those demands and, at the same time weasels behind ""due process"" concerns...a classic CYA maneuver.  

He touches on ""forgiveness"", but such discussion really requires a consideration of intent...a topic he  dismisses early in his email address.  Does the University need to be more ""inclusive"" and more open  to minority students AND faculty? Of course it does. At the same time it needs to embrace understanding, compassion and forgiveness..they're not mutually exclusive"

 “What am I supposed to do if I don’t like him and I don’t trust her?” a millennial black woman in Ohio asked. “Choose between being stabbed and being shot? No way!”

“She was part of the whole problem that started sending blacks to jail,” a young black man, also from Ohio, observed about Mrs. Clinton.

“He’s a racist, and she is a liar, so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” another young black woman from Ohio said."
"Legacy treatment IS preferential, but private institutions that depend on funding by alumni are not ""invidiously"" discriminatory when they give such preference.  Harvard taking in Bush on account of ""legacy"" is not like Harvard denying Obama admission on the basis of his skin color.  The former has at least some rationality to it; the latter, none.

As for equality of access to lawyers:  You really think Jesus insisted that society provide the poor man with as good a lawyer as money can buy?  What planet are you on?"
She said its what her community wants ! Then just do your job and stop trying to be glamour girl !

"It's kind of sad  that many of the same people who think it's right and ok for people to burn the American flag as part of freedom of speech , are all against free speech if someone wants the Confederate flag hung from a flag pole.  They fight against that free speech but are ok with burning the symbol of our nation .  In the same vein , they support Black Lives members protests as free speech----even when they call for killing police , yet if the Klan marches , they want them beat up and stopped.  And speaking of flags---when someone moves to the U.S. , they are supposed to be an American now.  Yet instead of becoming one of us and supporting the U.S. flag---they proudly hang the flag of the country they came from , from their car mirrors.  We should be one nation and loudly condemn anyone who would destroy our flag.  Instead , we want to destroy the flag and traditions that make us American's. Diversity in America is destroying us from within."
Where in any comment did I base USA as a success. I didn't. I listed all failures of socialism.  Not once did I mention capitalism. Then you cheap shot bush and I assume trump when I look at failures I look at debt and neither of those 2 even compare to obama. He was by far the most horrid. Not only debt but divisiveness increased ten fold from obama. The blacks are in far worse shape as well unless you count being on welfare as success.
These politicians that pull the race card need to be put down. Promoting hate seems to be the new black experience.
"Some people will complain regardless of any idea of what it is they are complaining about.  Let's see, Mr. Trump said he had learned something and Mr. Blow rails against him.  What exactly is his issue?
Diversity is divisive.  When I grew up we were told we are all Americans and we bring our history and culture and experience to a Melting Pot of American Culture.  Black America has historically not been recognized and Negro  History Week was begun to educate all of America about many of the contributions to our culture.
All these many years later people have no working knowledge of important people in American History and Black history is taught as though anything a black person accomplishes is special due to their oppression. 
Black America has been strong and vibrant regardless of their historical difficulties.  It is time for Black America to look to that history and ask why they aren't achieving those standards today.  Then again, New York Times columnists know no history."

"Are you arguing that the preferential treatment of Naspers was affirmative action under any other name? If we were talking about a straight business transaction, an open tender, I would agree with you, as long as the same rules of preferential Afrikaner upliftment were equally applied to each tender.  Party funding by businesses is also, as you say, normal and natural. However, if Naspers had been selling canned peaches and was funding the Nationalist Party as a quid pro quo in return for a lucrative government contract, would you still think it was OK? I would argue that that would be corruption, even if the beneficiaries on both sides were still traumatised and disadvantaged after a terrible atrocity, as the Boers were at that time, and as black people are today. But this deal wasn't canned peaches. This was the manipulation of minds. Propaganda. Even in the context of the day, it was a devil's deal."
"No, it doesn't. Take the sentence apart. If it stopped at ""I'm sorry"" then fine. Adding the ""you"" makes the person expressing a position the subject, removing the actual content of the complaint from consideration and placing the onus back on the one doing the expressing. In popular vernacular it's called a fauxpology. It's derogatory and disingenuous.  It's especially so, like in this case, where a black man is being told his experience isn't his experience rather just a way he feels about his experience (and isn't that too bad for him) and therefore totally discounts and disrespects his humanity. Empathy is when you can feel what the other person feels and is often mistaken for sympathy which is having a sense of compassion for the other person's experience."
"It does seem like that. I think it's completely sexist for people to see a woman as an extension of her father. I don't think most people are aware of this but Hillary Clinton's father was a vocal racist  - he openly called black people racial epithets, was abusive to her mother, etc. Yet I never see people holding Clinton responsible for his racist views."
"In the 1800s, in some states in the USA, there were anti-literacy laws that specifically prohibited teaching Blacks how to read and write.  Meanwhile, in Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald, Egerton Ryerson and others were advocating education for ALL children, even those in remote corners of our country.  Let's put their actions in the context of the thinking of the time."
"yes it does have lots to do with getting a cemetery. If the Klu klux clan wanted their own cemetary people would be disgusted. You say what does the Klu klux clan have to do with Muslims. Klu Klux Clan descriminate against all blacks and Muslims descriminate against all females. Thats half the world population of the world. Look at the muslim girl this week that will probably be put to jail because of her cloths, yes, her cloths. Any group that would do that is somewhat disgusting."
"I could care a less if the good Doctor is a woman or not as long as they can act and wouldn't have commented as I don't know any fans of the Doctor who care either but Tabitha completely lost me with the whole rant on political correctness.  It's a cop out to say that the people who are against it really just want to beat up on blacks, women and gays with impunity.  While I'm sure there are a very small minority of people who feel that way, 95% of us are sick and tired of SJW's telling us how to feel and react to any situation full stop.  To trivialize it by saying we're all racists, bigots or fascists shows a total lack of understanding - which she continued to demonstrate through the rest of her rant on the subject.  It's clear she's not a real fan of the Doctor but used this simply to expound on her silly belief that many people actually mind in this day and age if women are put into positions of power."
"In this context, of course it is. Kaepernick's own statements reflect his intent... that he would not stand to honor a country that treats blacks the way this country does. If it wasn't intended as calculated disrespect, it wouldn't be much of a protest, now would it?"
"Then you whiny idiots say, it's the black man's fault, it's the immigrants fault lol!! It's everyone else's fault but your OWN!?? That's called weakness, that's pathetic!!"
"You might have to wait a while longer:  

As an agnostic I am about 3.3% of the US population according to PEW Research Group.   The athiests about 2.4%.

According to a 2012 review by the National Council of Churches, the five largest denominations are 
The Catholic Church, 68,202,492 members
The Southern Baptist Convention, 16,136,044 members
The United Methodist Church, 7,679,850 members
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6,157,238 members
The Church of God in Christ, 5,499,875 members

The Southern Baptist Convention, with over 16 million adherents, is the largest of more than 200 distinctly named Protestant denominations.  In 2007, members of evangelical churches comprised 26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black churches."
"Thank you for being as close as I've seen to admitting the Democrats were responsible for both the slavery of the past, and the present destruction of the black family structure by making them dependent on social programs. But you failed to mention the Democrat educational policies that insure many blacks will never escape poverty by making it impossible for them to opt out of the inner city hell holes that pass for schools, as well as supporting the war on police that currently is causing black on black murders to skyrocket in places like Chicago. Anyone who is against these things should never vote for a Democrat, ever, even if this puts you in Hillary's imaginary ""basket of deplorables."" I consider her scorn high praise since she cannot even fathom the real reasons so many millions of people will never vote for her no matter who they have to vote for instead."
"Interesting you mention Nova Scotia, where blacks have lived since the 17/1800s and still dont own the title to the land they live on."
"-  -  -  -  or the Men in Blue,  or the Black population in Chicago,  or the 'bitter clingers', or the Little Sisters of the Poor -  ???"
"Looking for s2, I'm not going to get in to a debate  with you over this.  From past experience I've found your arguments  interminable.    It's like arguing with a birther over Obama's citizenship.  

To be clear, the burden of proof is on you to show that this dramatic Constitutional Act did not diminish African-American immigration to Oregon.  I hardly have space here to list all the obvious evidence, such as the higher black population in California and  Washington, but you can find them in any good Oregon history book.  I urge you to go find and read them.  

Frankly I'd never heard a serious argument AGAINST this view of  the  Exclusion  law until recently when some of Deady's powerful legal friends  rushed in to Pooh Pooh its demographic effects.
Your ideas, that blacks were too ignorant and ill informed to know that ""Oregon did not welcome Negroes"", and ""there was nothing here for them"" are remarkably  ill-informed.  
Please don't demand evidence from me again, just go read."
We already know that you're a racist who doesn't think black lives matter.
"Yes. If this was reported in a unbiased newspaper, it would read: 
""Black Man with Ties to Alt-left arrested for Threats on Jews"". 
but....wow...there is Just Too Much truthful, disturbing facts! -it Must be 'spun', it must be 'softened'. Disgusting!"
Only those who didn't like recovering from the recession under the leadership of a black president.
"What a joke. Black Lives Matter is a domestic terror organization that incites violence against cops. 

Meanwhile, Seattle really needs to get over its infatuation with socialism. Centralized government planning of economies does not work and policies like the $15 minimum wage only hurt low wage employees as they're priced out of jobs."
"Millions of the taxpayers of all ethnicities want to know when you are personally responsible for your own conduct rather than being victims in perpetuity with an entitlement attitude.  

You were successful in spite of your ethnicity; so was Trump's newly appointed cabinet officer, so was Secretary of State Colin Powell, so were millions of other black people. 

Ethnicity should not be either a crutch or an excuse.  

Unfortunately, that is what affirmative action and its ilk cause.  Public policy is affected by hundreds of variables; raising race to the pre-eminent status you seek is bigotry."
"Interesting comment. Do you have any stats showing how may black men were shot by police as well as stats of how many black males were shot by other black males? 
The ugly truth is there is a great deal of crime related to black males in America. There are also a great many black women who are raising their kids on their own because the fathers have run off to do whatever.
When you see a black athlete being praised for their on field accomplishments it seems the mom always gets the thanks, as they should, but you seldom see the dad in the picture. When a black youth is killed it seems the mom is always their to be interviewed. Seldom is the dad to be found.
America doesn't have a police violence problem, it has an absentee father problem."
"Except they won't be gone - the system replenishes itself. The new club will have men, certainly some women, and even 'people of colour' and non-Christian religions. But the club will still have the same rules. Social class is a sustainable, renewable resource."
"A person has a right to protest on their own time and on their own dime. Call the customers racist bigots? Free speech doesn't extend to private concerns. The complete hypocrisy of the NLF Union is equally laughable and pathetic. The NFLPU doesn't support protests against domestic violence, CTE, fathering children out of wedlock, using PEDs, income inequality, or racist statements such as the ""Black Power"" salutes the NFL players so frequently provide. 

The lowest paid NFL rookie players ($465K) make 8 times the median household income in the U.S. In 2015, the median salary was $860K per year. Virtually every NFL player attended college on athletic scholarships. They have zero student loan debt. NFL players live a life of absolute privilege because ""privilege"" is based on economic power. NFL players insipid racism is reflected in their vitriolic hatred of the U.S. The very country that has bestowed so much prosperity, education, and opportunities they revile. Sound about right?"
"We do have converts who are married men & are priests because they, in theory, were not able to discern their vocation properly outside our church.   

I disagree with this argument because if God wanted these men to be Catholic Priests, God is more than capable of making certain they don't find Mrs. Right before coming to Catholicism.  

However, as long as women are being ordained equally to men in our church FIRST, I have no problem with our church doing away with celibacy, later on or simultaneously.  

The difference is a human justice issue compared to a mere custom issue.  Denying someone a sacrament based on how they are born is discrimination against someone's flesh without cause in Christ to do so, which diminishes that person's value from birth.  So keeping blacks, women, Spanish, etc. from priesthood is sin.  The married men in our church chose to marry & not become celibate priests.  They were not discriminated against from birth.  There is no injustice done to these men."
"IF BLM were as concerned about black on black murder, none of this would be an issue."
There was no need to expedite the payment to Mr. Kadr. How much less treasonous Mr. Trudeau's settlement would be had he chosen to delay payment until Ms. Speer's and Mr. Morris' motion was thoroughly adjudicated.
""" ...  when we are no longer forced to watch this unacceptable display.""

I can't remember the last time I watched, listened or even noticed the national anthem at a sporting event. I turn the game on TV at the minute it kicks off, or I'm in the kitchen getting snacks, or I'm in line still coming into the stadium.

If someone is holding a gun to your head during the national anthem in your own home, that's on you.

The complainers are essentially telling black men: ""Shut up, be grateful for what you have, and stay in line."""
For numeral uno!!! I'm not Russian!!! I'm African American.... hehehe I may not be a Trump supporter. I just pray for him.  He a brother from another mother... Russia controversy has been in the media Major role in the social media age more than The Dallas Cowboys and the Golden state Warriors.   When you are #1 everyone remembers but when your #2 no one remembers . Conversation is ruling the nation!!!  God is in control of the universe!!!
"Quite simply, you are wrong.  

The NFL is losing viewers at a record pace for two straight years--the same timeframe as the nation-hating protests.  ESPN is losing 15,000 viewers per day.  Papa Johns will soon be joined by many other companies who want their sponsorship money back for the incompetence displayed by the NFL leadership.

And finally, your racism is showing when you claim something as asinine as ""when all else fails, blame the black people"" nonsense.  He never mentioned race.  Why did you?"
"Not much to celebrate right now but the Futuee under Trump has to be better.
It cant get any worse than it has been under Obama.
Economically, the blacks have not benefited very much from Obama's $10 rrillion deficit.
Most of that went to his Wall Street handlers.

Even at that, Obama had the slowest  economic growth rate of any modern President, even tho he started when the US economy was at a low level.

In addition, his term ended when the homicide rate of blacks in the US were reaching a modern high.

And of course history will treat Obama as one of the most warlike Presidents in modern history while joining forces with Al Quaeda and ISIS in Syria, resulting in millions of refugees and thousands killed, while stimulating a bran of terrorism that has destabilized Europe and caused America to close its borders for security matters.

So, its been a tuff for the past 8 years, so lets hope that Trump can turn the US economy around with lower taxes and more attention to the common man.."
"To the defenders of Trump, that 'he hires black people (Ben Carson, Omarosa)' is like the usual phrase when talking about homosexual or racial issues: I have gay friend, I have black friend, used as a shield of some sort.  It means very little.  What speak volume is his actions.  His actions, as listed in this article, show that he is a racist and a basic bigot - product of the time/era during his formative years and he has not progressed since.  Now shamelessly using race to divide the country just to strengthen his base is a crime against this country."
"100% agree. CCB helps with topping up some of that lost income, income splitting would provide a small relief as well (the number is not huge but it helps) AND for those who have a parent staying home are helping free up daycare spots for those who work. There should be support for all types of families raising our future taxpayers not social engineering to entice more low-income women back to minimum wage jobs."
"Recent polling results show African-American voters for Trump as low as 0%.  In other words, polls with a sample size of one thousand came up with not a single black voter supporting Trump. With good reason!"
India most definitely is 3rd world.  And Indians are needed desperately back in India.  The country is short a half billion flush toilets and all the infrastructure to support such.
"Trump is quite the hypocrite.

If you subsitute Blacks or Muslims for the neo-Nazis, Trump would have sent in the National Guard, who would have pepper-sprayed and shot them. Then, he would have declared martial law and had every Black and Muslim person arrested if they were out after dusk."
"You are exactly correct. The original demonstrators had a permit to demonstrate, the foreigner soros' funded anarchists and professional agitators caused all the problems while the media twisted this to state only the original demonstrators were violent. I saw a photo of a black guy using an improvised flame thrower to attack a demonstrator, the media claimed he was ""defending himself"". Typical of the MSM. All while the cops busted heads of the original demonstrators while doing NOTHING to stop the soros funded professional anarchists."
"That's utterly Orwellian. It's not ""cons"" who want to keep poor black kids in crappy schools or dependent on the welfare state, it's the Teddy Kennedys and the limousine leftists of the world. How's all that ""great society"" spending going for inner city Americans?"
"One more reference on this thing about ""religious liberty"", cake bakers, and gay marriage.

There is a very good article by Mark Reiff published in July in The Conversation here https://theconversation.com/a-philosopher-argues-why-no-one-has-the-right-to-refuse-services-to-lgbt-people-80365 .  He writes about liberties versus rights.  He outlines three kinds of liberty:  negative liberty, positive liberty, and republican liberty.  (The ""republican"" does not refer to the political party of that name but to the form of government we claim to have.)

Not all liberties are protected by rights.  Especially when one person's ""liberty"" infringes on the ""liberty"" of another.  And that is where republican liberty protects people against arbitrary treatment. ""the refusal of service to gay couples is itself an arbitrary act. It is an act of domination – just like refusal of service to black or Jewish people or inter-racial couples.""

Well worth the read."
"Not everything is about politics.   

It does not seem to me that the women intended any mocking of black persons.   She did not wear the 'mask.' 0f black face we see in film.  I think she's being falsely accused of racism.   

Not denying racism remains a problem and I understand why a race accustomed to being mocked and assaulted would be overtly defensive.   I just think this became a mistake of 'friendly fire' that hit the wrong person."
"Apparently, all black guys resemble robbers."
"When Philip Rushton  also a psychologist-  published his research on the relationship between IQ  and race he was never forced from his job at Western.

For example  even though he claimed an inverse relationship  between penis size and intelligence - he  continued to publish and teach

 (And indeed conservatives and black people tend to do more poorly on IQ tests - read the Bell Curve for example))

Under Wynne - one wonders if her pushy agenda would protect him now"
"And you would know because you're a black man who knows lots of other black people, right? Not that you're being patronizing  to black people or anything."
"Too little, too late. The Broncos can go p!ss up a rope. These millionaire cry babies are nothing but overpaid, stupid, selfish, and entitled turds. They're too busy thugging around and doing nothing to promote a healthy community. If the cared about 'black lives' they would tell their fan base to go to school, get jobs, and follow the law."
"Gary: Yes, of course. False flags work best when there is an ""obvious someone"" to blame other than the perpetrator. How did lynchings of Blacks get into this discussion?  That is murder.  As I understand it, no one has been physically injured by the recent rash of anti-semitic incidents. By the way, have you noticed that the NYPD thinks that the vast majority of the threats were made by a single person? ( https://worldisraelnews.com/one-man-behind-threats-us-jewish-institutions-investigators-say/ ). If confirmed, that will belittle the notion of a big wave of antisemitism. Also, if a single responsible perpetrator IS found, MAYBE his name and affiliations will be made public."
"Fact: Many African-Americans voted for Obama simply because he was black. Hillary's not black so thousands of those voters decided to stay home. Deep down the Democrats know this was an issue that contributed to their loss, even if they won't admit it."
"""Many blacks believe that Jews participated in civil rights out of their own immediate and self-defined needs and that their activism had little to do with Jewishness. That activism of the past, they say, tended to be both condescending and controlling. Never a relationship of equals, they assert, Jews sat on the boards of black organizations and held power in black institutions but never allowed for the reverse. They gave money to civil rights organizations and demanded the right to make decisions by virtue of the power of their purses. Moreover, they alledge, Jews today try to cash in on that assistance. They have ex post facto attached a price tag to the historic alliance and expect blacks, out of gratitude for services rendered, to censure voices within the black community.""

"I'm all for free speech, but if you're liking a picture of a black person with a noose around their neck, you better expect backlash."
"If Holland is needed today to close a game, I'm sure Black will roll him back out there.  The idea of keep tossing out there on a struggling team is baffling. 

I really like how Black has handled the squad all year but this event is sending up red flags quick with is inability to make the obvious decision. 

If the team fails to make the playoffs this will go down as one of the main reasons.  He protects his veterans without accountability.   Geez that sounds like Weiss."
"The United States continually kills people in many parts of the world and has for a long time. We are not in a good position to criticize the human rights abuses by other countries. Pot calling the kettle black, people who live in glass houses, etc. I would like all the rich countries to get the hell  out of other countries. Imperialism has gone on long enough."
"Yes, real gun control laws like Chicago, New York, and Los Angeles.  And why shouldn't blacks be armed, they have rights, too."
"OMG and with a black child, what will the base think?"
"So what do you think a manager ought to be accountable for?  Wins and Losses?  8 years with the Padres, 649 wins and 713 losses, no post seasons, two close but no cigar.  I am not involved with Rockies baseball enough to know who the other candidates might have been, nor do I care.  I am just expressing my opinion that Black can't -- or at least hasn't yet -- closed out a winning season.  Do you dispute that?"
"And it's ok for the NFL idiots to raise their fists for ""black power"".  Why don't these CTE work hole filled brains donate their money to build housing and get their brothers out of the ghettos.  Oh, they won't do that......overpaid idiots."
"So both sides of Zuma Inc are firmly of the view that independent-thinking, clever-blacks are anathema to the success of the ANC. In this of course they are correct, as an intelligent individual free to pursue and understand the murky currents of South African politics could fail to see the greedy, corrupt paws of the entire Zuma clan manipulating the political axis to keep them unaccountable and out of the courts and the money continuing to being shovelled into their ever-voracious maws.

How have they hoodwinked so many in the ANC is beyond comprehension and scary in it's incredulity."
the fact that the Republicans tried to repeal it for 8 years.....  because they hated anyone governing while black.
"First step in draining the swamp?

"The real issue, is the overdevelopment of the Waikiki district, and the overpopulation of the Waikiki district.

The infrastructure of the Waikiki district, in the 1960s, was never designed to handle the sewage & waste, that has been generated in 2017.

Hypothetically speaking only, if 1 million people flushed their toilets, all at the same time, the sewage pipes would explode, and all of the ocean water near the shoreline, would be brown to black in toxic waste.

The fixing of the Ala Wai canal, will not be looking 100 years into the future.

It will only be a temporary fix, for a temporary disaster, just like the RAIL."
"As Crawford Kilian has pointed out, regarding refugees coming to Canada: 
""The United Empire Loyalists were refugees. So were the Irish fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s and the black people escaping slavery in the American South. The Doukhobors were Russian refugees. We turned away the Jewish refugees on the St. Louis (“None is too many,” Ottawa decided). But we welcomed the Hungarians in 1956, the Vietnamese and the Ugandan Ismailis in the 1970s. No one worried about Communist spies and terrorists slipping into the country among them.""
Now some Canadians want to pull up the drawbridge. 
Whether we like it or not, we’re in the midst of the greatest displacement of people in human history, and it will only get worse. There are 65 million displaced persons in the world. Canada has taken in 25,000 this year. Not exactly bragging rights.
Refugees have made this county what is today. They can be an asset, not a liability."
"The national conversation is a mixture of both good and bad so far, some helpful, some divisive. I was thinking of the employment committee you were on when there may have been no blacks present. The black applicants being ""lost"" would not have even known they were being discriminated against unless someone like you spoke up in that situation. I would prefer we get to the point where we don't consider race as even existing, rather we are all just human beings. But I would also prefer that cultural differences still exist and be appreciated rather than being yet another source of animosity. In the case of those who legally emigrate (and certainly not by force or illegally) to a new country, they must be willing to assimilate to some degree while maintaining their cultural identity, such as being willing to learn the local language and understand and obey local laws and constitutions, as well as appreciate the culture of their new home. Otherwise, go elsewhere."
"Per Table 43 the probability of a black committing any type of crime: murder, rape, robbery, burglary, embezzlement, vehicle theft is much higher than any other ethnic group.

Asians are the most law abiding.  

No category for hispanics.

American Indians commit crimes roughly in proportion to their numbers as a % of the population.

Blacks, by far, are much more likely to commit a crime per table 43."
"5 or 6 responses, and you still fail to defend or provide support that you are a follower of Jesus and you denounce anyone who does not follow his teachings.

So it is safe to say I am correct and that you are in full back peddle trying to divert attention from your original post. Enjoy your Sunday, the hypocrisy of the day you decide to use the teachings of Jesus for your narrative is not lost on me."
Nice how commenters are dismissing this out of hand because they all are black and well acquainted with the reported experiences.
"Substitute  the  nouns: Jew, Black. female, gay, handicapped, and these stories  in today's Globe and all you  would have is simple hate speech that would certainly be actionable by the OHRC."
"Mr. Thorne has written a column that is entirely predictable. Writing from his secure position in academia and strictly following the left-wing narrative, the author adds nothing new to the public discourse.  It certainly is an entirely risk-free position for him to take.  He will see no students protesting his views nor any academics criticizing him, either because they agree with him, or in the cases where they don't, because they will be to afraid of the consequences of saying so.  But he is a law professor in Toronto.  Why isn't he writing about a current contentious Canadian issue, say the decision of the organizing committee of the Gay Pride parade in Toronto to ban gay police officers from marching in the parade? Does the professor agree that the organizing committee should have given in to the demand of the #Blacklivesmatter pressure group in ordering this ban?"
"This is only yet one more glaring example of how the state of academic discourse at universities in Canada is a complete farce. People running universities all across the land ought to be ashamed of themselves. I just finished watching video footage of that hard core racist Yusra Khogali hurling racial slurs at a black man on the U of T campus at freedom of speech rally. Universities are dangerous places when prominent members of their student political bodies are allowed to run around the campus oppressing members of minority groups with blatant hate speech and university administrators do nothing about it. A clear human rights violation, on a university campus yet administrators turn a blind eye? No, somethings wrong in the world of academia and the people running that fiasco have no business in trying to form solutions to it. They'll make their safe spaces but make no mistake. At the university of Toronto, that black man who was clearly a victim of a hate crime, should not feel safe"
"From the information provided, it appears that the Black SA is 'crying wolf'.
If the windows are as darkly tinted as it appears, there is NO WAY that you could tell WHO was driving.
So to imply racism in this case, is possibly the only 'racist' action. Hers."
"Since Black Lives Matter obviously knows how to deal with these situations, I suggest they volunteer to be on call whenever an armed black person is threatening to harm others and BLM could come and handle the situation appropriately and show us all how it should be done."
"""a past that is glorified as good, stable and, really, a lost utopia.""

I think that's a mischaracterization of Foyle's War.  It shows a war-time England of black-market corruption, military cover-ups, upper-class treason, police malfeasance, and (immediately postwar) political dirty tricks.  Hardly a lost utopia.  More like the story of one honest policeman in a dystopia."

Bennet needs to wear a body cam at all times and install cams into and outside his house and car. Trouble is black people give themselves a bad name and nice guys like Bennet suffer for it. What can they do to reverse this? You tell me.
Why do racists and haters of Muslims beat around the bush?  Why do they hide behind fig leaf weasel words and twist like pretzels to hide what they truly believe when they blog in the Globe and Mail. If you hate blacks and Muslims just say it directly. What are they feeling guilty of? They want to engage in racist behaviour without having the label applied to them.
"If the G&M is reporting a watered down version of a UN report dealing with racism in Canada that describes African-Canadian racism as being so ingrained that it's considered 'normal',  why are Canadian athletes showing unity with the U.S. while ignoring the plight of the same group of people in their own country?

This article offers nothing new that the other 10 or 20 articles on the topic have highlighted. What would be newsworthy is not more of the same but given the conclusions of the UN's observations, why aren't Canadian athletes doing something similar to getting on one knee in their own country?  Why would they ignore the racism in their own country but support American athletes and blacks.

"When Trump launches into a spittle-flecked tirade against those #BlackLivesMatter radicals who think police should shoot fewer unarmed black men, the racism is so obvious it might as well have been written in the sky by the Blue Angels."

Americas new Commander in Chief and First Lady!"
"Not who I was expecting- nor I think most folks were though anti-Semitism in the African American community is not unknown. This has always been odd to me as Jewish Americans were at the forefront of the civil rights movement. This guy- as is usually the case , seems more emotionally troubled than anything else. In any event this accounts for less than 10% of the threats and hopefully suspects more to folks liking will be found and arrested."
"No Allan, they're not protesting the treatment of black Americans. 

Colin Kaepernick was protesting the treatment of African-Americans last year.  And none of those players was kneeling alongside Colin Kaepernick last year.   Those owners linking arms with their players and mouthing off are the very same owners that have boycotted Colin Kaepernick from the NFL -- the hypocrisy is overwhelming.

All these protests are about Trump's conduct.  And that's not worth disrespecting your country.  

Trump's behaviour is great. Trump's supporters knew what they were getting when they voted him in, and he's delivering.  Like I said, Trump's conduct is far better than the deceitful lies of Trudeau, Obama and Clinton."
"As a side benefit of all of these findings, Manafort, if his ""hands are truly clean,"" may have a good legal argument for malicious prosecution by an FBI and a special prosecutor WHO ALL KNEW that this dossier was a fraud.  The FBI, knowingly broke and entered Manafort's home with a S.W.A.T. team under false pretenses.  Now that is an aggravated felony and a pox on the FBI's house, if ever there was one.   This federal corruption must go even deeper.  I suspect that Barack Hussein Obama would be actively ensnared in this corruption, and may have even instigated it.  But we all know that finding Obama in contempt of Congress or in jeopardy of incarceration will never occur...because he was our first black president, or pseudopresident, as the case may be. One more note on the Manafort break-in:  I am so glad I was not Manafort.  There would have been a large number of federal casualties and one ""dead me"" if anyone broke into my home unannounced."

"Um... I am an American and I know PLENTY of African Americans who voted for Trump. There's a reason he did better with them than Romney.

Last Sunday, while staying at a hotel in Lafayette, Louisiana, an African American female guest started talking to me about politics. She told me she voted for Trump because he is a businessman, and is only taking one dollar in salary. You have no idea of the hidden support by African Americans for Trump"
I also support Zuma as our president because she doesn't involved in any corrupt activity till now and she always talks about the development of our nation and empowers the woman of SA also.
"We were never exceptional except in some imaginations - all humans have the possibility for great good or great evil.  We were fortunate for many years to have found a way to hide the evil (treatment of native Americans, Japanese, Blacks, etc.) from our own minds and emphasize the good.  Now that we must accept who we actually are there is a huge backlash that wants to believe the lie and ignore the truth - truth is we were never exceptional."
"I just Googled his name. He was an activist born in 1909. He was old enough to have had first hand knowledge of Christians lynching blacks in the South and was, therefore,  an organizer in black communities. He died in 1972 at the age of 63. I’m older than that now by a number of years. Oh well… Could you say that Michelle just quoted, Saul Alinsky, if that in fact is what happened?"
"But Santa is Christ-centered, whether people know it or not. Although it may seem Santa is secular, it's the principle of his character -- to be a giving, generous person -- that is based on what the bible instructs us to do in life. Be good neighbors, give to the poor, be kind to one another, bless people, share and give generously, etc. Santa represents goodness and kindness, what is wrong with that? No need to traumatize a child at a mall. by age 10 or so, they find out that Santa isn't real, but the concept of Santa plays out in their parents, family, friends, etc who give gifts out of love. This guy is creating a battle when there's really no need to fight the belief of Santa in our culture. Black Friday, well, that's another something horrible that could be rallied against, but not Santa."
"Thank you Mr. Robinson; the 2nd Amendment does indeed apply to African-Americans and the silence from the NRA speaks volumes about how they view this. This terrible incident blows enormous holes in the ""good guy with a gun"" argument we have all been fed. Johnson was a ""good guy"" until he snapped. No matter what his private ideology was, he was able to legally purchase and carry firearms. There were other armed ""good guys"" in the crowd none of whom were able to stop this. Somehow, the amazing Dallas cops managed to avoid shooting any good guys with guns but the presence of those armed citizens cannot have made identifying the shooter any easier. Until we start valuing life and condemning the mind set that allows people to think they can solve every problem by shooting someone we will not move forward. 
BLM exists in response to endemic racism in our legal systems; address that racism and BLM supporters and police will all go home safely."
"And do you feel the same about blacks being gunned down, or is it just Finicum?  How about Michael Brown?"
"I reserve the right to put whatever make-up I want on my face.  If I dress up as George Washington or Michael Jackson, I mean no disrespect.  In fact, emulation can generally be viewed as evidence of admiration.  I am truly sorry that there are so many sick people out there that think black is intrinsically offensive and that is exactly what is being said in disparaging black make-up."
"I've been a Broncos fan since 1978 but that is in the past now.  With the players kneeling  
in support of black lives matter and who knows what else,  protesting president Trump for taking away their 1st amendment rights I say the NFL and the Broncos can just go to Hell.
I'll never watch another game.
Colon Kaperdick started all this with his childish behavior and now it's infected the entire NFL.

Goodbye Broncos."
Its unfortunate but it is hardly a capital offense any more considering how  often  black persons call each other N  and think its just  swell.
"Given that virtually all ideas in Ottawa have already been test driven in Ontario with disastrous effect, presumably a glance at the partisan sinecure and carefully constructed black hole that is Infrastructure Ontario will shed some light on the types of  problems any sane and sensible fund manager would be wary of when the Prime Minister presents Gerald Butt's sticky fingers in the shape of a national infrastructure bank.."
"The right to be left alone is not absolute, which is why viable fetuses are protected as part of the public interest. Non-viable fetuses are not because there is no authoritative statement in national law giving them that interest. Pass it or don't pass it, but don't act as if that is not the next logical step. The findings of Roe don't change until you do. There is a police power that exists when there is no General Will, as Rouseau would have called it. Libertarians also have General Will critera on some issues, although opion is mixed on abortion. The police power of the states is restricted under the 14th Amendment because they constantly misuse it agaisnt Latinos, Gays, Blacks and Women, as well as Catholics. The tenth amendment is largely oveturned by the fourteenth, the state must prove an overriding interest to target legilsationat a class. I suspect adult consensual incest laws are void Adultery laws have mostly been overturned. Bigamy laws won't last a challenge."
"Sorry but that apology from the actress does not go far enough.

I think some mandated public grovelling, and a few hundred hours of sensitivity training are in order.

Or else 60 seconds in the same room as the main mouthpieces of the Toronto chapter of Black Lives Matter."
"You're welcome, I guess. Although I can't shake the sense that my irony somehow missed its mark. 

While there is certainly some anger in my inflection, I tried to modulate it. And I'm pretty sure my remarks are not contaminated by hate. If I gave a different impression, I apologize. 

My intention, for what it's worth, was to note the presumption of violent criminality so many young Black men grow up with. I've been privileged and heartbroken to observe the effects of that presumption in children and youths,  ranging in age from six upwards.  I appreciate that you may not share my interest, or perspective, in this matter, but surely you can grant that it has some relevance  to the topic."
"Schatz stop mentioning your Jewish heritage you hate your heritage and you hate Jews your heritage has nothing to do with this, both sides are at fault as trump said today he is right he waited for all the facts to come in before he made his speeches about these violent acts, he was not going to put his foot in his mouth like Obama did a few years ago about a black killing that took place before the facts were in, this was before the Zimmerman incident so trump made a very good speech today about this criminal act that happened over the weekend  you had one Nazi group and you had another group that were paid by Soros to start all this rioting and fighting, since trump won the media and everybody is trying to overthrow this president and our government because Hillary lost that's why anything trump does good the media will condemn it. also the mother of the girl who was killed tweeted trump and thanked him for his speech.  Schatz your speaking out of your you know what very shameful."
"Let's be really clear, here:  these monuments are monuments to Jim Crow, the period in which they were erected, with the message of subjugation to Blacks.

Do you really think that message should be perpetuated in front of courthouses in the United States?  Because that's what the fascists are fighting for."
"Thats snowflake, thats a yuge chip on Pauls shoulder and he wants everyone to feel oppressed. He didn't approve of having a black president And now he and his ilk have a new N word to cling to, a new set of tired clichéd slogans to cheerlead.
Decoded, but they still use it to identify each other, like a big obvious wink."
"Respect is not a God given right, as far back as I can remember it had to be earned. Black men will never gain the respect of anyone until they learn to respect each other. 73% of all our black children are born out of wedlock in single parent homes. The black neighborhoods chicago and beyond are riddled with crime, drugs, gangs, prostitution, murder, blighted neighborhoods, domestic violence, no work and poor education. The number one cause of death of black men between the ages of 18 and 34 years is black on black HOMOCIDE!!!!!  How can they expect anyone to respect them when they in turn do not even respect each other. These millionaire football players are completely out of touch. If a police officer never killed another black person, there would not even be a little dent in their plight. The football players need to give back more than 60 seconds on their knees to their brothers. It will take generations of hard work, they need to be active in addressing the black problem"
"Not all Republicans are racists. However, they are all collaborators with racists. They are like the ""good Germans"" that never asked, where did the Jews disappear to? Today, they never question why cops kill so many unarmed black  people, including children."
"Who:  I think we could spend unending time blaming each other.....liberals blame the conservatives; conservatives blame the liberals; Blacks blame the police; police blame the Black community.  Republicans blame President Obama; Democrats blame President Bush. and so forth.  What would it accomplish?  A great deal......and none of it good.  How about us all looking at the situation and trying to do our small part to help make things better.  Things are a real mess. The level of trust between the police and much of the Black community is a as low a level as I've seen since the pre-Civil Rights days.  I we can't all work together to make things better, they're only going to get worse.  I agree with your (unstated) suggestion.....we do, indeed, need to ratchet-down the rhetoric.  regards, Gary"

"BOOOOOOOOO! You need more Jesus "" sarcasm"". Your hearts still black."
You must be a Kevin O'Leary groupie and convinced Conrad Black is innocent.
"For 2 months my email box filled daily letting me know you put a gold star on my posts, and on over half of my posts you replied positively and added to the debate. You even stated you wished I could be more liberal with my comments toned down for this board. Then you learned I smoke pot and now you're posting crap like this, even when you're in agreement with what I said. Does your bigotry towards pot know no shame or dignity? You're now acting like the racist who agrees with me, until he learns I'm Native American and then starts treating me like I am black. Your dysfunctional behavior is quite curious to me, and especially from a man of your age."
I wonder what the people who are calling this a first amendment issue would say if they saw a player burning a  Black Lives Matter sign or a rainbow flag during the anthem.
"That guy was kinda creepy anyway, i like the blonde and the black chick on the specialists, its a good show 😎"
"Blacks feel insecure, thence they are seeing and blaming racism at anything that isn't."
"You know what they call a football player of African descent who makes $14M a year in The Confederate States?

Hint: it rhymes with ""bigger"""
"I figured you had read what Kaepernick had to say about it, but since you seem to believe you are the only one who has read the articles or listens to the news, here you go, ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""  

Seriously, I have a right to disagree with how he is protesting the issue, even if I were to agree there are problems. I would never not stand and show appropriate respect to the Flag or National Anthem. However, as I said, I will defend others' rights not to show what I consider appropriate respect under the First Amendment's protections of free speech."
"Nobody cared back then. All women paid their dues by tolerating unwanted sexual advances. They just don't have to anymore. We also don't send indigenous kids to residential schools, we don't import slave labour by way of unwanted children from London's east end to be worked to death and abused, we don't make blacks sit at the back of the bus and pay them less. All those things were considered acceptable at one time. Now they're not. Social media is letting everyone know it not ok anymore. It's called progress. It's a good thing."
"Actually he does not. His ""America first"" is saying ""Trumps First"",
along with his greaseball kids/immediate family. It""s Trump only.
Furthermore his own :""divide/conquer Nationalism is Hitleristic,to say the least. His personal vendetta and pathological hatred of the previous President of the U.S.A,ain""t exactly believing in America,nor is his hatred of Mexicans,Muslims,Blacks and probably Sheet Metal Workers local 549.
Trump won""t unite this country.
If ya""ll can""t see that ,you ain""t been aware."
"Shizz!!  That an honest, and objective, and dedicated,  South African woman, loyal to her country and to its progress,  should be intimidated and under threat,  is ludicrous.  Crazy-mad. The ANC has gone, and has been replaced by a Mafia.  And that Mafia is now threatening our country, and should be removed by whatever means available.  Why?  Should we have to fight, to get rid of them. They are already criminals, and traitors, and should all be chucked into gaol (or jail),  without any more faffing about. Why, again, are South Africans so scared of taking action against wrongdoers?  Too much intimidation by this Mafia?"
"Abortion is a personal choice. While not a fan,outlawing it will not stop abortion just make  unsafe and certainly will not make the mother love the child. But when we talk about having a President we must look at the whole role of a President. He represents us- the American people. But instead of looking at that, we have elected a man who seems to have no problems with people suffering even more. What happens to the 20 million plus who have no health insurance. What happens to the disable and elderly when Medicare and SS is dismantled. What about those of color or people of other faiths. Trump has done little to separate himself from his racist views especially with who he is choosing who will be his closest advisor.  All these things that Trump stands for are views Catholics and Christian should not support. Those who voted for Trump because of abortion has excepted his other evils as OK. Since abortion is a personal choice some women will chose it legal or not or who is in office."
"Ruth,

Don't be fooled by the official sounding name, The American College of Pediatricians is not a ""large body"", it is a fringe group of about 200 arch conservatives that split off from the 66,000 member American Academy of Paediatrics (AAP).

"Well, slavery isn't legal anymore in the US, so what's your point?  The ports-of-entry and ICE are finally able to get back to their missions according the laws that exist on the books."
"Geez, you're first sentence makes it sound like players such as Currie get chained to the bench and whipped if they don't sink a 3 pointer. The guy is a gazzilionaire and got a free ride through college. 
I might also remind you of people like Condoleezza Rice, Colin Powell, Bernard Shaw, and Barack Obama. 
As far as the Patriots go, more than half the team is black and they were all invited so I don't see your point."
"I saw a dog, that dog was black, the conclusion must be then that all dogs are black. Essentially this is the premise of Duncan's article."
BLM needs to make cops the bad guys as their raison d'etre or else they slide away into irrelevance. Cops were happy to take part and enjoy pride . Now they are being demonized. BLM looks like a racist organizations that apparently does not actually care about black lives-and that is the worst part of all this. What's next black hoods ?
"Once again point out the racism. Irish isn't a race. Nor is Roman Catholic or Muslim/ Islamic. That doesn't even take into account the massive differences in every facet of life from 165 years ago until now. No one in my immediate family was a conceived thought 165 years ago. That's like frican Americans demanding reparations for Slavery. First blacks themselves owned slaves. Secondly I never owned a slave and you never picked cotton. The past is the past. I could show non stop polls of Muslims who repeatedly, with majority, claim to hate the west. These countries also produce the largest number of terrorists. I don't want them here due to racism just
Plain common sense. You want us to adopt to Islamic shari'a law and have no respect for western culture then stay there. Pretty simple concept with no room for race."
"Obama has done such a horrible job and been an absolutely useless President....  race relations worse now than for the last 50 years, highest number of people who want to work but can not find a job, highest number of people on food stamps, number of illegals has grown to over 20 million, US reputation around the world has diminished, advancement of pussification of people rampant, etc. etc. etc.
NAME ONE ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT HIS FANS CAN CELEBRATE...  other than trying to destroy the society of the US.
Want to know why Obama is not moving back to his ""hometown"" where a lot of his fans are and basis of this pablum story? Too friggin dangerous as people get killed there... almost all black on black crime... every day and all the time.  If Obama was a real person and not the ""emperor has no clothes"" guy, he would move back there and try to fix Chicago. But, not Obama.... now that they are millionaires... who cares."
What have Black and LGBT people have to do with bicycle licensing? Methinks you might have some other issues to think over. Cyclists aren't the only group you seem to hold in disdain...
"Unfortunately, Obama didn't do really well in reconciling black issues either."
Destroying the Alaskan economy at the onset of what will be the largest recession in state history.......that's not a plan.....that's intentional debt slavery for this state.  taking anything from the PFD is taxation.  Making new income tax is taxation.  These will accelrate the disaster to come and compound its damage which will be substantial.  Hang on for the ride..
"The Ottomans Empire had a population of 20 million, whereas the Mughal Empire was closer to 100 million. This is like saying that the UK and the USA are equally large economies.

Second, the Ottomans did not impoverish their colonies. They didn't even convert the entire population of their Christian provinces. There is a reason Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Georgia, Armenia, Crimea, etc remained overwhelmingly Christian. Whereas Latin America, sub saharan Africa, Spain, Portugal, Sicily, etc were forcibly converted to Christianity. Surely you don't think the Christian approach was better?

I understand that you have been taught that Europeans did the Asians and Africans a huge favour by robbing them. I hope one day Asians and Africans can return the favour. That they do exactly what was done to them. According to you, it was all very uplifting and pleasant, right?"
"Mr. Bilet, you managed to condemn the Black Lives Matter movement, the anti-KKK and anti-Neo-Nazi's protesters, along with keeping the ideals of slavery alive and tie your opinion and views into a national disaster in Texas.  Shame on you.

Your comment could have simply suggested contributing to relief agencies and volunteering where someone might do the most good."
That's hilarious.  You are saying if you are black there are people all over the place taking shots at you.  That actually is only happening if you are a Crip or a  Blood and the other team is taking a shot at you.  You are a hilarious stereotype.
I think an American Indian should replace Jackson.  After all it was Jackson that committed genocide against Indians.  The Blacks never were treated as badly as the Indians.
"Here's another comment for DM. You have just now given me some stupid black marks for marking others' comments as being 'civil' that you think aren't. Well, this is a warning for you. Fix your bloody stupid marking system up, or I will bugger off anyway. It's ridiculous."
"Of course it was about protecting the institution of slavery!  ""States' rights"" concerned the right to keep humans in perpetual bondage, to buy and sell them, to torture and rape them.

Not framed in those terms.  Southern politicians claimed that holding blacks as slaves created conditions for all members of their society, including the slaves, superior to the inequities and strife of northern and European society.  But the large body of slave narratives shows this lie for what it was.  See, for instance, Frederick Douglass' autobiography, or Solomon Northrup's TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE, lately adapted into a movie.

If you doubt southern motives as they existed before the Civil War, please have a look at speeches by leaders of  the southern states before their secession.  You can find some of those speeches at http://www.confederatepastpresent.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=41&Itemid=54&limitstart=10 .  ""States' rights"" is post-war whitewashing."
"Jade: Mr. Kaepernick and the other players around the NFL are now ""taking a knee"" during the Anthem.  It is a ""personal"" act, but as with almost all protests is done in a public forum to bring attention to the ""cause"" involved.  His protest has been quite effective and the protest has garnered increasing support from other players.  Additionally, his actions have encouraged a wider discussion of both the ""cause""....the treatment of blacks in our society, especially the treatment by police; and, as a byproduct, the discussion of Freedom of Expression guaranteed by our Constitution.  Both discussions are important.

The threatened violence against Mr. Kaepernick and his family represent, IMO, a far greater threat to the values I cherish than does his protest.  I'd be interested to read the counter-argument if anyone would care to present it.   regards, Gary"
"We have not seen anything yet.  Just wait until Trump actually becomes President.    We will see suspension of rights, incessant attacks on immigrants, people of colour and especially Muslims. 
 There will be a time in the not too distant future when Canadians travelling to the USA will require special  VISAs if you were born not in Canada.  There will be an attack on Canadian businesses doing business in the USA if they have health plans that are integrated with Government plans, as they are all.  A lot will be illegal uder US law, but so what? Trump believed that the President is the law.

I feel for the USA, and my friends who live there."
"This country was founded on racism and slavery. Now what? Apparently, the notion (fake news) that the Democrat party was founded on racism is neither here nor there, as that is the party that receives the lion's share of the black and minority vote. It never works out for Republicans."
"Bravo NFB! I am so pleased to hear this - as an award-winning film composer who is also female, it's so rare that I get to hear the work of other female composers. While our male colleagues are doing (and will continue to do) tremendous and breathtaking work, there are many voices out there who haven't broken through, and it takes courage, innovation, and commitment to seek those voices out. I'm particularly excited to hear from women composers of colour, Trans, Indigenous, differently-abled, and mixed-heritage composers. There is a huge, wide, and wild world of sound out there. I'm so excited for what this commitment will bring to our industry. redheartbreaker.com"
no...but I've seen plenty of riots by blacks who burned down their own neighborhoods because they didn't like obeying the rules like the rest of us...
"Police officers have led to the murders of blacks, so now where are we? Well, I'll tell you. Out of the two groups, only one swears an oath to uphold the law, the cops, yet they do not hold up the law. In fact, they use their government granted powers to commit crimes against innocent people, notably blacks."
"Dr. Ben Carson is one of Trump's black friends who is a very successful neurosurgeon and who didn't succumb to the victim mentality in his life, that you and your group love to thrive on."

Someone takes my wallet - I can report it, and chances are quite good that the police will take the report seriously. I won't be blamed - for having too big or too black a wallet. Report sexual harassment? Racist threats? That's a whole different ballgame ..."
Also Ervin is pointed out as black n the story. Why didnt they point out that he is also native american or jewish? Do native americans not deserve their race to b spotlighted?!  The guy looks hispanic to me! Let others decide the race not that it matters. If the  newspaper wants to make this event about race then they should include all the races and cultures! Its all so stupid. This journalist deserves the gold medal stupid award!
"My brother is dead as well.  He was lying in the bathtub one evening, pleasuring himself while chatting on Facebook.  The laptop slipped off its perch and fell into the tub, electrocuting my brother.  Mark Zuckerberg didn't even call to express his condolences."
"Uh, exactly where, precisely, did the Life Site article print false information about Miss Weiss?  You do not cite one example and neither does Shea -- he just blabbers on about guilt by association.  It seems that not one fact in LifeSite has been proven to be false.  Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. Also, any teacher who tried to use Lolita as a text at a Catholic college should not be teaching there."
"I suggest you read the US Justice Department DAG memo 8/29/13 that outlines their stance on state's rights on marijuana enforcement. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (signed by Richard Nixon) categorizes marijuana a schedule 1 drug, defined as a ""drug"" that has a high potential for abuse and no medicinal value. First off, marijuana is a plant, if I buy or grow a plant, it's none of the government's business whether I eat or smoke it. Second, it's very widely accepted that marijuana has a very wide array of medicinal and therapeutic value, so this is an absurd scofflaw. If you look at the list of drugs on schedule 1, these are all plants and substances that were widely used and accepted by the anti-Nixon movement and the Black Community. The CSA was used as a tool to scare the public and incarcerate Nixon's opponents. It's time for change."
"Yes and no.

Canada was gladly the terminus for the Underground Railroad out of slavery in the US. In Toronto, there were African Canadian city councillors (aldermen) in the 1800s. The first black newspaper in Canada was founded by Mary Shadd in Buxton, Ontario in the 1850s.

I don't mind if Canada is called out for what it did wrong; but I'd like some credit for what we did and are doing right.

We need more actual history taught in our schools and recognized in articles like this."
Disparity in sentencing is not confined to black people but to Native Alaskans and other minorities as well.
"My problem is they can't define what they are protesting about. Fair, and Equal are opinions based solely on personal emotions. Tell me what actions do they want  actually want to change. If they are using a example like the Micheal Brown shooting, than they are basically asking for the police to no longer arrest black people, because they are black."
"The sad thing here is that companies like Swifambo (if it is really a company) reinforce the belief that BEE is a sham, and some State Owned Companies actually support this sham. It sounds like a company primarily formed to merely be a BEE partner and profit from a service into which they did not add any value. Maybe this judgement will deter those who form companies to benefit from deals just by being black."
"How much respect do certain people on this forum give to black citizens, Outsider? Very damn little. I find your 2 cents to be hypocritical. I see a lot of folks here melting like snowflakes because of something they don't want to hear or think about. For heavens sake, if you can't stand the truth, ignore it. I know many of you are capable of that."
"As soon as you look pass the color of President Obama's skin color, you may very well realize that President Obama looked pass the nation's skin color and tried his level best against a Just Say No Republican-led congress."
"Wait a minute, they charged a 71 year old lady with feeding wildlife because a bear got into her trash can? Are you sure? There must be more to that story.
Her trash removal company should have provided her with a bear proof container. That's what happens in Glennallen. If a bear starts showing interest in our trash can we call our local trash company, C B S, and within the blink of an eye they are there replacing it with a new can. I mean, they are right on it, FAST!  
I once watched a black bear return to his favored can only to find it had been replaced by a bear proof one. He got up on top and jumped up and down, tried to pry the lid up, pushed down on it, smacked the sides of the can, and sat down looking at the thing perplexedly Oh man, it was SO HILARIOUS!."
"Um, your argument is a PC left wing progressive Den leader kicked a progressive left wing kid out of the Den for questioning a Republican State Senator for her un-PC remarks about black people? Is that right?"
"Disagreeing with Elvi Gray-Jackson does not make you a ""racist"".  When I first saw her comments in the ADN I didn't agree with her and I have clue or care what race she was.  When I first saw her picture my first thought wasn't that she was black, it was that she looked like the Joker."
"As a democrat and a black man we go dress up in kkk uniforms shouting we love trump and the funny thing is people start hating trump and republicans. It's easy to get so pissed off and march and riot. It's so easy to get a balm crowd together too. We will destroy America from the inside. We own ADN and CNN and the news. As long as we stage it we can get people to assassinate Rubio trump and others. It's so fun as democrat life. We get away with murder like Tupac says. Look at Hillary Clinton, she did and we loved for it too."
"one word: Xenophobia, and the entire article is trash at ground level - basic black racism is what negates the articles title entirely"
"Maybe signs - ""No blacks allowed"", ""We dont serve Indians"". Oregon's alt left has ridden a time machine back to the 1940's and adopted that era's philosophy wholesale - socialism and the KKK."
"Yeah.
And don't forget Bo Diddley, Little Richard, and Fats Domino.
   Bob Dylan always said Little Richard was one of his major influences.
 Without Chuck Berry there might not have been Beatles or Rolling Stones.
  The radio airwaves might still be filled with the likes of Perry Como, Dinah Shore, and the military marches that sent boomers off to school in the 1950;s.

  In an era of puritanical mass conformity and fear of being different, rock 'n roll was about sex, rebellion, danger, and giving black folks their due credit for their amazing contributions to American culture.
   After Elvis was grabbed by the army, he lost his mojo. When he was co-opted by Hollywood he didn't rock much. When he started playing Las Vegas he was done.
   Today rock 'n roll isn't dead but it's weak. Time has proved, no rebellion = no rock 'n roll. And we are all the poorer for the timid tenor of the times"
"In short, the structure of the Welfare System has created more single moms, the destruction of the family unit, the high unemployment rate among black youth, and the high crime rate.  The Welfare System incentivizes all of the negatives.  And once a kid has a criminal record, he's virtually unemployable for the rest of his life, so crime is his only option.

And that's why it's called ""The Welfare Trap.""  You can't get out of it."
Bud Black has a false pulse on the team if he truly believes the Rockies are excited to play right now.  Why now?  That's BS.  This team is anything but excited...they are lost in the wilderness with obviously no leader in Bud Black.  Anyone can see this team is anything but excited.  Bud Black - you don't belong here if you can't tell they aren't excited.  Bud Black - clearly you must think the team can only be excited when they are in the fight of their lives - you must've hated being 20 games above .500.  Comment of team being excited should have you fired now...you do not know your team.
"I'm Asian, and about 70% of the racial slurs thrown at me have been from black folks. They ranged from ""Open your eyes!"" to ""Do you speak English?""

"Jim, it was a great book and I'm glad your Mom-and many others read it.  In fact as a sociologist back in the 60s I also encouraged my students to read  it.  However, that was then and this is now.  Comparing this to Shurtz's behavior is a stretch, as Griffin's brave trip through the Deep South produced much  racial understanding whereas her Halloween party  for her students has caused mostly confusion and anger, well intentioned as it may have been.

"Allowing a business to use Religion as an excuse not to serve someone is the ultimate slippery slope to allowing a business owner to discriminate against anyone, for nearly any reason.  How is refusing to serve a gay couple now any different than the racists that refused to serve blacks or mixed raced marriages back in the 40's and 50's?  The answer - its not.  Its discrimination painted with a different brush and people are using the Bible as their shield.

And to be clear - no one in this case was forcing this baker to do anything different than what he already did for hundreds/thousands of customers before.  No one asked him to cater the wedding or write something on the cake that he found offensive.  It was simply the fact that a cake he was making was going to be used in a gay wedding.  Thats it.  So, based on that standard, could the owner of Hobby Lobby come out and say they no longer will sell any of their products to anyone who has had an abortion?  How is that any different?"

"""Freedom of religion"" is an American right in the Bill of Rights.

It has nothing at all to do with events outside the United States, which are not regulated by the Bill of Rights.

What does bear on freedom of religion in the platform is:

""We support a progressive vision of religious freedom that respects pluralism and rejects the misuse of religion to discriminate.""

A group of prominent black clergymen brought this to the losing candidate's attention and pointed out the exiting Administration had used this policy to attempt to compel people of faith to perform acts abhorrent to their religion, both Catholic and Protestant. They received no response.

Unfortunately for her candidacy a 306-page report by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights issued Sept. 8 titled “Peaceful Coexistence: Reconciling Non-Discrimination Principles with Civil Liberties” made crystal clear the implications of this bit of the platform."

"Important to clarify that it was ""Canadian banks"" that did not cut their dividends.  In other countries, not only did the banks eliminate their dividends, but the equity values cratered by almost 90% (for those that did NOT go bankrupt).

To say that Canadian banks will ALWAYS pay a dividend is complete hogwash.  If Canada ends up having a housing crisis, or energy crisis or other financial black swan event, Canadian banks could very well be in a situation where they are forced to cut dividends (just like what happened in the US, Europe and Japan).

If someone is losing sleep over the potential of a black swan event, then there's nothing wrong with allocating a portion of one's portfolio to cash/high interest savings.

"I have been critical of some of the BLM tactics....such as hijacking a Sanders' rally in Seattle early in the primary season.  However, the movement's quest for equality is commendable and, IMO, over-rides my concern with some of the ""in your face"" tactics which have been employed.  

There have been times when I, too, as a political activist have been what others have considered obnoxious.  Sometimes when officials and politicians continue to ignore your concerns, you have a choice:  give up or become a bit obnoxious.  

BLM has become a significant nationwide movement for the empowerment of the Black community and has my support.  

Quite likely without assertive, and, yes, obnoxious actions such as that Sanders' rally intrusion, the movement would not have been as successful in raising the profile of issues facing African Americans in our country.

"That's right!  It was all about politics as far as Pope Leo X was concerned.  Unfortunately, after the Reformation---there was a very bleak aftermath all over Europe.  The seventeenth century started off with Christians fighting each other to establish their respective beliefs as superior to each other.  It was not only Catholics and Protestants fighting each other, but also Protestants fighting each other as well.  By the time that the eighteenth century began---many educated Europeans didn't want anything to do with Christianity in ANY form.

Or perhaps their social elevation has exposed the inherently decent nature of these people to a broader range of viewpoints and open debate, leading to a Damascene moment.

As a movement fighting to end apartheid, the ANC could claim a right to the loyalty of the black people it was seeking to enfranchise.  As a governing party the rules are different and the ANC's inability to walk the walk means that heads are starting to rule hearts within its traditional support base.  References to its pantheon of past leaders won't help either as the inevitable comparison is not flattering to the moral and intellectual pigmies that dominate the ANC today."

The Nazi and fascist past will not be erased but in Europe this period can and is discussed and their horrific crimes can stand as a warning to future generations. That is exactly how the Confederate symbols should be treated.

"You wrote:

<<His hands were NOT up, which then gave us the lie -""Hands up, Don't shoot"" bogus slogan.>>

Ever pause to wonder why the crowd at Ferguson was so ready to believe an unarmed black man had his hands up before being shot to death by a police officer? Maybe because there was a history of police abuse in Ferguson. As elsewhere. As in the case of Walter Scott, for instance. Of course Scott didn't have his hands up. He just got shot in the back.

<<The actions of these men, and others like them, keep people of color from getting themselves out of impoverished circumstances.>>

He claims that he is speaking for all black Americans (""The truth is that the black community is looking on warily and with a rising sense of alarm at the chaos"").  That is manifestly not true. Many black Americans voted for Trump because of his strong commitment to fighting crime in large cities, such as Chicago and Detroit, where gangs are terrorizing black communities and where the local Democrat parties, in power for decades, have done little for the safety of the population. Mr. Thorne also deliberately avoids mentioning any of the prominent black Americans who at great risk to themselves and their families have publicly supported Trump.  For example, read what football legend Jim Brown had to say.

He wants to make HUD an agency focused on enhancing human capital. There is plenty of common ground between liberals like you and conservatives like me and Ben Carson, a guy selected for his position by Donald Trump, of course. Too bad that seems to be enough reason for some to dismiss Carson."

"Chicago's 760 murders last year isn't really all that bad. Most of them were just men working out their problems with other men of color.

When somebody looks at you funny you have a right to pull out your Glock and empty the magazine, right?"
"""Perhaps the saddest commentary is that instead of focusing on the shooting for what it really is – a police officer’s error that resulted in the tragic loss of life – some have chosen to instead score political points and make this about race and religion. This shooting was not about race.""

Since that time, there have been very few republicans switching to the democratic party but much more democrats switching to the republican party for economic reasons, not race issues as your side believes.

The gift comes from God and shouldn't be ""split"".  It should be received wholly, fully, completely, lovingly, trustingly - as a couple - a unity.  Not as mere individuals to be picked and chosen from. 

My point on diseases is entirely buttressed by diseases in Africa.  Were sex and marriage and children and love and responsibility and sacrifice NOT divided, there would no disease problem in Africa or anywhere else. 

Complementary isn't at all limited to just women...preposterous.  Of course it applies to men, entirely so."

One of the places the Church could outreach that would do the BLM kids some good would be to outreach Catholic police in order to help them stop operating on accepted assumptions that all younger black males are out to kill them.  It maybe the best outreach the Church can do is not in parishes but in communities.  In think that's where Cardinal Cupich is headed in Chicago and it can't come too soon.
Dude gotta ask where in hawaii did you watch the older men drop the n word and boy when talking about blacks. been livin here a long time and in the 60s weren't no blacks but a few military who'd kick yer butt if ya called em boy. what you smokin dude.
"You don't ""win"" the Medal of Honor (it's just the MOH, no Congressional), you are awarded it.  It was also counterintuitive to dump thousands of slaves into ""freedom"" to which they were wholly unprepared for.  I guess people such as Frederick Douglass, and others who reported on black combat troops fighting for the south were wrong then..even though he states he saw them, under arms, participating, as early as the 1st Battle of Bull Run.  History is written by the victors, and it sure wouldn't fit the narrative of a ""war"" to ""free the slaves"" if blacks were acknowledged as fighting on the ""other"" side.  There were free blacks in the south, and even black slave owners.  Again, economics, not racism.  As for Walter E, I suppose you COULD ask him what he's basing his statements on.., but then...are we allowed to ask liberal academics what they base their claims on?  Uh, yeah...thought not."

"There are things that I like and don't like about the church.   But sometimes you have to take accept the negatives to stay in relationship with those that give your strength and happiness.   

I was lucky to have a pastor Kevin Korver, who read a ton of books and often used references outside the realm of the strictly religious experience.   He had lived in a mostly black neighborhood in his father parish in L.A., he often told the story of his personal Shame, when he met a dying AIDS patient who saw his fear and said ""why don't you shake my hand preacher boy?'.   He was not your run of the mill rural/evangelical Iowa pastor.

The image of that church's evangelism was Always on the positive, believing in the strength of God's love for all.  I never heard condemnation of the non-religious in that church.   They offered kindness, acceptance regardless of your current status, including criminal and any skin color.   Not every member followed his lead, human's are like that!  ;-)"

You are talking nonsense.  Total nonsense.  Killing is equated with black make up at a Halloween party.  Insanity.
Great read.  Difficult to empathize or even conceptualize that kind of wealth. Sad to read that the two memorable Canadian examples are a felon ( Conrad Black ) and an equally unsavoury ex-Prime Minister.

"President Obama and Clinton are denouncing Islamic extremism and ""lone extremist"" that are American born, Newton.

"When the Italians came, they spoke Italian for a long time, especially in their neighborhoods.  The same can be said for the Germans, Swedes, Poles,  Chinese, etc,  and you know what, people of those times made the same complaint as you.  ""Identity politics"" is something people made up in order to disparage the continued fight for equal rights, and liberal/Marxist is a term invented to disparage those who fight for equal rights .  You are absolutely right that equal rights should lead to color blindness, but it also goes the other way - you need equal rights for everyone to achieve color blindness.  And Dean, this country has talked of the melting pot for more than a century, and for more than a century many people have excluded immigrants and people of color from the pot.  You say you worked in the civil rights movement, yet you ignore history with the comment ""dismantle the melting pot idea which made us so cohesive""."
"The GOP's relentless obstructionism during the Obama years didn't provoke enough outrage to cost the Republicans politically. It's dereliction of duty as far as I'm concerned. (Still no movement on filling that vacancy on the Supreme Court!) Yet a generic Republican would've had a good shot at beating Hillary.

Many voters just don't care that much about trying to get a grasp of facts and the historical dynamics driving American politics. It's more about personal pique and truisms about the process."
"Fine, as I am prepared to respond regarding why she lost her party's nomination to the first black president. That's it. Read it. She lost to the first black president. So we were looking to have either the first woman or first black president but not both and not both at the same time. Obama is and was awesome. So she had competition. You and your ilk make it sound like she lost to Mickey Mouse. Mike Tyson lost a couple of professional fights. Are you suggesting that because he lost he sucks and you could have beat him? There is no shame in losing to Obama. And there's no shame in losing to Trump, when one considers that most people are simpletons and he got the simpleton vote."
"Irrationalist, no one is asking for proprietary rights in any formal sense. But aboriginals DO have a right to speak out and argue that non-natives should keep their mitts off their stories. It's their political, cultural opinion and they are entitled to it. Argue with the substance of that opinion and consider deleting your racist aside about the 'civilized world.' Your false, paternalistic argument ignores that people have always argued about who gets to say what in art and in what way. Women authors were once derided, black writers too of course, and militaristic victors get to write the history books AND the culture stuff too until oppressed populations write back. Your view that it's all supposed to be an apolitical sharing party is naive. And btw, culturally oblivious appropriation writers do not 'build on common knowledge'--the point the column makes is that they distort, marginalize, and insult. Watch the documentary Reel Indian and check your privilege. I did. It didn't hurt."
"I know that the owners have black-balled him, but maybe now is the right time to make that phone call to Kaepernick and get him on the roster?  Distractions aside, can anyone honestly say that Lynch looks better than Kap?"

"I honestly believe that although we may suggest things to do to make it a more respectful place (ideas above), things will just have to play out on their own. Look at how long it has taken Black Americans to become somewhat 'accepted' citizens in the U.S. Still, there are pockets of people who will NEVER accept them, the same pocket that this junior legislator probably identifies with. We had a Black president, and a good one at that, yet there still was/is disrespect toward him, his family and his people. 

Native Alaskans and Alaska may just have to go through the whole schmeer, the hard way, before the atmosphere in and towards Natives is a more accepting and respectful one. Lawsuits, walks, protests, shootings, you name it. We cannot weed out those who are not accepting just as much as we cannot control what people think, believe in or do.

I actually believe that the process has already been started. We just need to wait, and suffer, until the majority of Alaska/U.S catches up."
"Oh yes, don't fool yourself, there are professional protesters/organizers out there. Take PDX  for example, known to me as the young  man, with the mega-phone. In the last few weeks he has led various protests..: BLM; Portland Police contract negotiations.protestors wanted say in contract language; Marches, resulting in 1 million in damages to property and a burden on the public safety budget.., yesterday he met with the Mayor agreed to organized gathering but no marching. Lost control of the mob and they were off and at it again. This is now a gathering of themes, the election, lgbt rights, homeless, anarchists, BLM. Pretty much the kitchen sink. Now the Genie is out of the bottle,  the base is expanding to high school and junior high age kids who are excited and want to be a part of the energy.The professionals sometimes lead, sometimes consult but teach ""noise"". ""Make as much as possible, it's how change is made, you must get a level that can't be ignored.""  Be it Ferguson or PDX."
"Left-wing politicians get new friends whenever they think that the political winds are changing. In recent years, they have abandoned the LGBTQ community for their new friends - the Muslims. Liberal and leftist politicians have also done absolutely nothing to lessen poverty amongst blacks in the U.S. or Canada. Their policies have kept them poor deliberately so that they can remain permanent clients of the state and the poverty industry."

The NAACP has a right to object to incidents of perceived racism. African-Americans are sensitive to racial slights every day and are subjected to the present political climate which has encouraged this type of overt racism. No person of whatever ethnic background should have to tolerate such callous disrespectful behaviour!
"That doesn't address the question of why so many black, completely unarmed suspects, suspects running away, and so on, are shot, except in terms of a lack of training and professionalism by the police. Police, who are supposed to be equipped to deal with dangerous situations, confess to being scared to death. They are especially scared of black people, which could perhaps be excused on the part of an untrained lay person. Do you think military police and members of the clandestine services respond to danger by emptying their weapons into the subject? I don't think 5% is a very impressive number. But it's about the money. Police mostly handle routine social scut work and most are not really emotionally and physically trained to the level necessary to deal with dangerous situations, and policing is not even in the top ten of dangerous occupations. The public simply doesn't want to assume the cost of training police to the level it would take. And, no, I'm not going to swap studies."

The Gathering Place is once of very few places where women, transgender, and children can go to actually be safe. It's not a perfect place, but much of what is there is a perfect example of what humanity should be like: Caring and acceptance.  It's a place where the people who go there talk to each other and help find answers by sharing their own resources, like change for the bus, like a place to stay for a few weeks, like a friend to talk to, like a couch in an apartment to rest in for a couple of weeks, like a place to share writing, music, and art."

His absurd idea of prejudicial leadership teased out the people’s leadership to protect everyone’s rights.  Yes, indeed, this is now a time to stick together, not necessarily stick out.

I have a high hope for the America and her noble people!!!!!!!!!!!

"The ""highest structural response possible"" is the formation (eventually) of an ad hoc USCCB ""committee"" on racism is an appalling comment.

It is also an appalling statement indicating a management quagmire of ineffectiveness that masks as a religious leadership organization. Where ""statements"" eventually rung out of such a committee pass for pastoral leadership, and are expected to ""solve"" the issue.

The ""highest response"" possible is for all 200 bishops plus in the US heading up all those dioceses to immediately and publicly condemn the recent horrific comments and behavior of the president and the behavior of the anti Semitic, anti black, anti just about everything protesters.

And immediately these bishops in all these 195 dioceses should instruct the clergy in these dioceses to address these issues with the faithful and evoke appropriate response....

Anything less is nowhere good enough.

But it WILL satisfy the USCCB, which is a feckless organization, unlike Jesus in the Temple"
"No, you don't. I've been to dozens of peaceful protests, and no one EVER brought weapons or shields. I'll bet you've never been part of a peaceful protest in your miserable life. The videos don't lie: the Nazis attacked counter-protesters, they beat an unarmed black man with metal rods, they poured kerosene on a person in a wheelchair and tried to light it on fire, they attacked unarmed, uninvolved students on the UVA campus with their ridiculous tiki torches. They threw urine on journalists. They threatened unarmed church leaders and worshipers, barricading them inside a church. They terrorized the innocent, unarmed, law-abiding residents of Charlottesville. They antagonized and threatened black residents of a housing project. Even their ""invitations"" to the event encouraged violence. You don't even know what you're talking about."
"Interesting Fact: Regardless of the race of the policemen, it's been found that because of the over-arching stereotypes and narratives, policemen of any race are more likely to discriminate against minorities and especially black people. This includes black officers and is tied to implicit bias. It's very complicated. Most incidents of racism are caused by implicit biases, not explicit ones, meaning that even though an individual on a concious level thinks racism and discrimination is wrong, at an implicit level they still react a certain way. No one escapes implicit bias.It is therefore critical that we are aware of them."

"As to turnout and percentage of blacks, this election they favored Trump considerably more than they did for Romney or McCain. That, combined with the exact same dynamic among Latinos, and the unexpected turnout of rural voters, is going to be the fly in your ointment for 4/8 years. This was not Trump's election to win; this was Hillary's election to lose. All she had to do was spend just a tad bit more time among the people she deplores, and we're not having this conversation."
"Black Dude, that correction will have to start with the elemental teaching of critical reasoning skills.  A skill set that we've been washing out of the minds of our children for the last 40 - 50 years."
I agree with you.  Polls can not tell you how many people are actually going to vote.  One only has to compare the number of people at Trump's rally's to those of Clinton.  When Obama has to play the race card to get the black vote you know they are worried.

Does anyone care that this area has one of the highest home ownership rate in the entire city?

"The core FLAW in this author's argument is the simple fact that very stringent screening procedures HAVE resulted in a low number of radical terrorists entering the US . So in a convoluted way she argues that more stringent screening if not a ban are unnecessary. Huh?
We also know that all the countries on the list have been targets of US covert or overt action - directly through bombing (Libya, Syria), drone strikes (Sudan and Yemen) or sanctions (Iran). Because they have been US targets, that alone makes them enemies of the USA and therefore in need of careful screening.
She also ignores the point that this is a temporary ban until improved screening measures are in place. Until then why take the risk?
Trump isn't so much making the US safer he is just cleaning up the mess left behind by his predecessor - that indirectly will improve American security.
Fact is Canada also screens applicants from these countries to the point that very few if any get in - we just don't publicise it."

Ten or 15 years from now, when we have enough statistical evidence, my guess is you'll find that the majority of black women that had to use their weapon in self-defense had to use it against a black male, age 17-29.

To say that owning black people as slaves is wrong now but not in the past is a lie and a very harmful one.

Abuse & the stripping of rights, whether civil or sacred, is always wrong.  Sin can not become righteousness over time, and Righteousness never becomes sin.  So either it was always wrong, harmful, and sin to allow the church to buy and sell black people, and either it was always wrong to strip women of their sacred right to same sacraments based on their flesh, or it never was & isn't now.   

The church needs to repent of the sin of sexism, even though that is uncomfortable.  The psyche of our women has been too damaged by this false belief of unworthiness of female flesh to just change and not repent - only truth heals."

You weren't troubled by the fact that small construction firms report that Trump doesn't pay them and either files BKY or tells them ""see you in court""?

You weren't troubled by the fact that he was busted by the DOJ for illegally refusing to rent to black Americans or  steering them to his predominantly black building (aka racial segregation)?

I think you're coming from a genuine POV.  In fact, your opinion may well be indicative of the player's opinions currently.

But when you state that you haven't heard of the players saying they support the BLM position (which is often violent), you're being intelectually dishonest.  Look back.

And for the BLM folks, hey, yeah, black lives DO matter (reference Chicago).  What about Asian lives?  Mexican lives (Mexico City)?  US Virgin Islands?  Puerto Rico?  Houston?  I could go on forever...   how about we ALL matter?  We're in this together, right?  I remember being pissed when my brother took my hot wheels car...  just saying.

Further, Hillary Clinton has been involved in arming terrorists.

She was involved in the CIA/State (Amb. Stevens) program to ship weapons from Benghazi to Turkey for the Syrian “rebels” (the REAL Benghazi scandal, read Seymour Hersh’s ‘The Red Line and the Rat Line’). She also led the push to arm jihadist “rebels” in Libya, including al-Qaeda, who used Her guns to kill innocent men / women and to perpetrate “The Black Libyan Genocide.”

SHE PRESSED FOR A SECRET AMERICAN PROGRAM THAT SUPPLIED ARMS TO REBEL MILITIAS, AN EFFORT NEVER BEFORE CONFIRMED."
"The U.S.A. leadership, especially presidents, for 2 centuries have been propelled by irrational HATRED. 
Early leadership hated Native Americans so much they wiped them out in a century of wars, even genocide. 
Then the South's economic success became too much for the North, who suddenly developed hatred of black slavery to justify a war to wipe them out. Lincoln after all was from way North. 
Somehow American leadership developed a deep hatred of Hitler before WW2, even though Nazi Germany have not done a darn thing to hurt America. 
After WW2, unable to wipe out the other winning country the USSR, American leadership suddenly developed insane hatred of Communism, but which they loved during WW2. 
GW Bush is all about hatred of all things Islamic. He tried to wipe it out with war. 
Obama, a black man, suddenly found a resurgent Russia who challenged his Exceptionalism. He tried to war on it, but got defeated. 
And now we have The Donald. He hates China very much. Very very much."

Under pressure, is that what we should expect from most gun owners? 

It's a great illustration of the risk of gun ownership, a single incident of anger, or depression, can cost a life if you have access to a lethel weapon.  I'm not saying that disqualifies people from ownership, just a statement of fact about the risk of owning a gun.    If it helps, I tell a similar story to people looking to own a pitbull - that you are making a choice that involves a very real risk."

"political correctness can be right-winged too. For example, you can't criticize cops, Israel, capitalism, the USA, or religion. They can be just as intolerant, if not worse. 
Trump's birther thing was caused by his immense jealousy: that a black man with a muslim father, who grew up in various parts of the world, was  the president when HE wasn't. I doubt it was racism. Trump is a petulant adolescent."

"It's sad that Hadiya's dad told her that the old lady on the subway didn't like her because she is black. That might have been true, but it would have been more accurate to say that some people don't like others because they look different. No one is immune to discrimination based on appearance, e.g. racism, which arrises from ignorance and fear. Unfortunately people from visible minority groups are much more likely to experience racial discrimination, by pure statistics. Everyone should be aware of this."
"""there seems to be a presumption now that you shouldn’t say anything if you can’t embrace the totality of the Canadian experience.""'

Lol! Nice to see a representative of the Left get a dose of his own medicine. After decades of attacking any viewpoint as not ""inclusive"" enough, it's their turn to they find out how it feels to not be able to ever be inclusive enough to satisfy the critics...

Yes, one cannot possibly give an overview of Canadian history, or any other history, in a few hours, while including every possible group and detail. 

Maybe the problem is trying to cover all of Canadian history in a single series.

 The US, as pointed out, has a whole industry cranking out detailed historical documentaries on every aspect of American history: whole multi-episode series just on the Civil War, or the Black Experience, etc. We would need to do the same, i.e. one series on each different region and period, etc., for all possible viewpoints and details to be fully represented."
"Kennedy deputized the Alabama National Guard to force Democratic Governor George Wallace to accept Black students at the University of Alabama.  It sometimes is very wise.   

So now you call conservatives racists?  The second most liberal president in the history of the country (after Wilson) Democrat President FDR was the one ""rounding up brown skinned people."" He impoverished and interned Japanese American citizens during WW2.   

You are consistently wrong but continue to post your unsubstantiated and hurtful opinions anyway.

"History and anthropology tells us that North and South America did not originated any human life form. That means that all humans in this hemisphere came from else where. This includes the Natives, Europeans, Blacks, Hispanics and finally last but not the least, Asians like myself. But just because I am last, don't make me feel like I am inferior nor do I considered the natives who were here first, to be my superior.  Other people also discovered the western hemisphere, like the Nordic people or Chinese long before Columbus, maybe even going back to ancient Romans or Africans!! But it was Columbus who announced it to the Europeans and direct result of that was the founding of our nation.  History is often grossly politically incorrect since it does offend people. But changing holidays will not change nothing of what happened in the past nor will it make it better. It window dressing at worst. It time to move on, accept what Columbus did and not feel the guilt of being here."

"I guess you don't raise livestock or have chickens/other birds.  ""Black"" guns (i.e. .223's with large magazines with ergonomic features proven through continuous use by the military) are great firearms for shooting the groups of wildlife that thinks farm animals are a wonderful food source.
""Black"" guns of other calibers are great for dangerous game like wild boar, and coincidently, effective for hunting larger game, too.

As for ""nut jobs"" inflicting their ""own brand of evil"", not having access to a firearm has been recently shown (and in the past) to not make much of an impact.  The most deadly school massacre was not done with a firearm, as well as the most deadly nightclub massacre."
"Your comments really show how ironic and hypocritical the left is about this man.  The news covers every minute detail about he and his family.  Recall, Barry the Wonderchild didn't get nearly the scrutiny.  It was all roses and coffee cake with Michelle and his daughters.  It was news stories about how great she looked in a dress that could be bought at Target.  But with Trump, it's stories nit picking Melania's choice of shoes.  And you on the left lap it all up and drink it down and use it to condemn him, his family and anyone associated with him.  Then, you have the gall to question someone who points out that he made billions or points out any of his other accomplishments.  And these aren't minute accomplishments.  So funny, the smallest negative news is big to you, and the biggest accomplishments by him are discarded.  I now know why liberals have houses with no mirrors."
"What does that have to do with your contention that 94% of black voters are paid by welfare to vote Democratic? Nothing. Zero. Nada. Or are you claiming that only black Americans care about Social Security and Medicare? LOL. You just keep digging yourself in deeper as you make stuff up about black people. And that's why black Americans eschew the Republican party. You make things up to demonize and marginalize black Americans. The more you comment, the more I realize I will NEVER vote for your anti-black political party."
"This is a sentiment I hear frequently from folks (mostly seminarians and priests) who have a fondness for the Extraordinary Form.  Then again, I see those same folks adding features of the Extraordinary Form to the Ordinary Form Mass, even though, at least in my reading, the indult Quattuor Abhinc Annos (cf. condition ""d.""), would seem to prohibit it.

So it would seem ""say the black, do the red,"" only counts if we like the red."

"As it did with South African apartheid, the international community has spoken concerning Israel's unjust policies towards Palestinians. But let's not kid ourselves: just like the Afrikaaners, Israelis are proud and independent. Israel will hate being told what to do. It will surely resist international opinion, just as South Africa did. 

There were a number of nations that were only lukewarm in opposing South African apartheid, and some that refused to apply sanctions when called on to do so. Israel was one of them. However, in the end, without a shot being fired over the issue, South Africa eventually relented to international pressure and did the right thing.

To be sure, doing the right thing in Palestine won't magically transform the area into a New Eden. Political, social and security problems will continue, just as they did in SA. But by removing an impediment to justice and equality, a much greater conflict was averted in South Africa. The same is true in this case."

"Long gone are the days (about 10 years removed) of the Alaska that voted like Idaho (Trump +32), Wyoming (Trump +46), and Nebraska (Trump +26). Alaska will continue to trend away from the Republicans, though Alaska will likely continue to command a 10-15% Republican advantage in Presidential elections for the next dozen years or so.

It's just a matter of how quickly oil-worker parents and their children who arrived in the 1960s and 70s are replaced in the electorate by millennials and religiously unaffiliated voters . Finally, in about ten years from now, AK will become a minority-majority state (Alaska Native/Black/Hispanic/Pacific Islander majority)."
"The article does not mention that the majority of America';s Catholic Bishops, especially Cardinal Burke, wholeheartedly supported Trump -- Burke claimed there was only one possible Catholic choice. Our Catholic bishops sold out the African-Americans and Hispanics with full knowledge of Trump's racist statements throughout the campaign. The deportation of 800,000 children is an intrinsically evil act against human life, just as abortion is. The bishops picked three issues -- abortion, birth control and gay marriage -- and ignored the person of Jesus, the Gospel, and  the 
Beatitudes."
"I have no reservations in opposing your attempts to control those who are addicted merely because you are offended by them and their habit.  Eugenics is precisely the same thing.

She and W.E.B Dubois 'worried' that the Negroes would view it as genocide, but they proceeded anyway because keeping these women from getting pregnant was 'for their own good'.  Your tobacco plan is also 'for their own good' although it is also because you are offended.  Anytime I see someone coming towards me to do something  'for my own good', I will react with any 2nd Amendment tool I can find.  And I quit smoking in 2003; I'm defending the rights of others to be foolish, not myself."

"Can government solve these 'black' problems or do blacks have some responsibility to solve their own problems?

My primary experience with blacks has been in the military.  Black Sergeants, black officers, black troops.  Guess what, in that environment, basically what tries to be a meritocracy, blacks succeed or fail based primarily on their own personal hard work and efforts.   Sometimes there is 'affirmative action' or favoritism by black mentors, but most of ones I saw had too much personal pride to want something that they hadn't actually earned.

The other soldiers, sergeants ad officers are more likely to enforce the standards which apply to everyone to their black peers.  The 'government' sets the standards and the blacks have no more difficulty meeting them than any other group.

If we compare that to civilian society that I can see, it appears that the motivated ones went into the military and the the rest went into the gangs or the prison population."
"Salman Abedi, Khalid Masood, and Khuram each speak to the necessity of implementing the Prevention of Terrorism Act when a person exhibits radical Islamic tendencies.

Abedi was filmed worshipping a large black Daesh flag in Regent's Park and like Masood and Khuram was known to spout radical Islamic propaganda and attend services at radical Islamic mosques.

When persons behave like this, then they need to be taken into custody, investigated interrogated intensively;  if there is probable cause, then they need to have a hearing to determine whether or not to jail and/or deport them.

The security services must act forcefully because there is simply not enough manpower to watch closely all of the suspected radical Islamists.  If there are reasonable grounds, as noted above, to suspect that a person has been radicalized then he/she needs to be taken into custody forthwith.  It is not a perfect solution.  But it is the best solution.

Do you have solutions to this problem?

Thanks, Nigel."

"I have seen more bad constitutional law than conspiracy theory from the left, especially on impeachment. There have always been conspiracy theory on the left, mostly among Greens. Some of the misinformation is deliberate, like the meme that abortion rights are in danger. Of course, the right wing likes to believe than can be, even whe they are not. Of course, much of the conspiracy theory around capitalism turning to oligarchy is true. As for the article, it relies on an unpublished study and a survey provider most people have never heard of. Ironic.

This shows that Long deserved his sheepskin from UVA. Good for him!

"""can a hate message be peaceful?""
This is an excellent moral/ethical dilemma which I don't think I can truly answer. For the purposes of the First Amendment and the purposes of ""protesting"" I think the answer is yes. When BLM was protesting, several of their chants were ""hateful"", even threatening towards police.
One of their worst was ""Pigs in a blanket, fry em' like bacon""
That chant meets your argument of ""hate message"" but was considered acceptable by the left. (Even defended) Only one of the racist chants I heard on the news hold a candle to that imo. (Much of the crap spewing out of their mouths as individuals was worse though.)

Frankly it's bigoted to refer to minority groups as malcontents."
"""a rash of racially damning incidents"" ... there was one incident in Eugene, not a ""rash.""

"This is a complex issue with bits of truth on many sides.  In light of Edwin Coleman's findings, the assertion that black students feel ""unsafe"" in the building, if true, suggests a serious educational flaw exacerbated by today's negative emphasis on wrongs rather than rights (as if victimized groups don't have enough ""real"" issues to worry about).  Ironically, universities (with a few glaring exceptions - see Donald Trump's perversion) are supposedly established to discover and broadcast truth.  From that perspective, it would seem that keeping Deady's name on the hall could provide a valuable spring board for demonstrating how racism can be transformed into tolerance and positive social action - which is just what Deady appears to have done in his lifetime.  If delivered, that lesson could go far toward alleviating black student's concerns about entering the place and help to constructively recast campus dialogues for improving inter-group relations."
"Let me just settle that right now. I have never smoked pot, never used any drug of any type (save legally prescribed medicines from a doctor and liquor). I voted against the ban because marijuana is incorrectly scheduled by the DEA, the voters of this state have spoken, and by opening it up and taxing it we create revenue for our borough to provide important services. We also provide an avenue that will gradually, overtime, reduce and eliminate illicit sales.

The 1920s-1933 had tons of bootleggers selling alcohol from backroom speakeasies. Now that liquor is legal, the black market aspect is largely gone, and it's been brought into the light with enforcement, understanding and tax benefits."

"Ms Black: I'm not an attorney, but I did sleep in a Holiday Inn last night.

As I stated, the more you study this issue the clearer it is that the proposed measure is unconstitutional.  ORS 230.035 is very clear..Read especially sub. 4: which reads “Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the rights of the electors of a county to propose county ordinances through exercise of the initiative power. [1973 c.282 §2; 1981 c.140 §1; 1985 c.756 §1; 1995 c.712 § 87; 2007 c.155 §12]”  It simply couldn't be clearer.  

The Initiatives you reference have already passed the ""single subject"" review and been approved for signature gathering.  That is not the issue involved with the proposed measure.  The Commissioners who support this proposal wish to grant themselves the power to prevent the Initiative process if they feel a proposal doesn't meet their definition of ""county concern."" This is precisely what ORS 230.035 sub. 4 prohibits.  

The meeting on 9/13 should be interesting..."
"Again, this isn't about benefits or advantages its about justice.  One of my close friends at church took over 2 years to find a job as a CNA in an area which has shortages of people with those skills.  Why, simply because he is a black man.   He had the skills, he had the work history and there are plenty of openings he was applying to each week.   When he did get a job it was only part time at the worst hours anyone could ever want and then when their department had cutbacks he was the first to go.  What is just is a have a level playing field.  In the same token when the discussion of unity in the church is brought up then if the conferences can show they want to have equal opportunities and resources for all then there can be discussion then there can be discussion.  If not then no one is going to go and simply let themselves be exploited so the point is mute.  Sending love in Christ."

What Humpety Trump said in his speech hurt those of Obama and even Mr Bush and Slick Willie but the facts are exactly that.  Our country is in a mess, and it needs to get cleaned up top to bottom and from side to side.  While it didn't measure up to your expectations, Mr. Will, it hit home for those who don't live in tinsel town and for Joe Lunchbucket, it gives hope that campaign rhetoric wasn't that with Trump...he means it.

"Stereotyping is probably the biggest cause of our current public unease. It is not a new problem; it is a thinking skill or lack thereof that challenges us all.

Coverage  by the reliably left CBC comes to mind (suspect Scheer's status as a Catholic will actually shield him from some of the more vicious personal invective).
Values of the urban progressive left is cluttered with ever shifting exceptions.  Perhaps an on-line site with the latest trends and fads de jour would help clarify things."
Just the fact that Trump has black friends would seem to me to be a major clue that he is not racist.
"President Trump has been proven truthful again!! As the smoke has cleared in Charlottesville there were no less than three groups who were at fault. On Friday the Klan, with a permit, was the only group there marching peacefully. The first 24 hours were so peaceful that the police in the town issued a stand down order. The next day the busses arrived with the Antifar group and Black Lives Matters who then taunted the supremacist group. This is were the riots began so Trump was correct in stating that all sides were at fault...
 
The Democrats have seized on the monument issue to cover the fact that Russian narrative has fallen flat and Mueller is about to be out of a job. If the Democrats want to remove a statue why don't they make a move to get rid of General Albert Pike in Washington. The Left and the Democrats will not touch this statue!  

 It is sad that in all areas of protest led by the Democrats someone is hurt and someone's property is destroyed. This is what they do."
"It's a good thing that Dr. Ben Carson, the new HUD Cabinet Secretary-designee, didn't accept your hate and belief that no black can ever be equal in our society.  

He would never have left Detroit and his two brothers and his mother in the inner city and become a pediatric neurologist.  He wouldn't now be worth $20 million.  He would never have been the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland from 1984 until his retirement in 2013.  He would never have pioneered pediatric neurosurgery there.  President Obama would never have presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He wouldn't have written those eight  books on self-help and goal-setting and such that helped earn him that net worth.  

Instead, he would be stuck in Detroit with the other brothers doing what those who believe your hate do.  You know, the sort of things those four in Chicago did last week.  Or he would be dead.  Those were his other two options he chose not to follow."

"Ah, so this was a pathetic attempt at a ""rhetorical"" question.  Problem is it also constitutes the logical fallacy of false equivalency.  The flag to which you allude stood for suppressing the rights of black folks.  The ""advancement"" part of the title you're whining about represents rightful desire and striving to throw off the yoke of said suppression.

It also represents the reality that for most of our nation's history there were state-sanctioned social and legal BARRIERS to black folks advancing beyond their suppressed status which were backed by--likewise state-sanctioned--violence.  You can delude yourself these no longer exist because for you they have NEVER existed.  But for some Americans they still do--just not as upfront as when I was a kid.

As for what ""offends"" black folks, doubt you associate closely enough with any to have the slightest idea what they find ""offensive"".  That much is obvious from your posts."

"The Republicans showed up for Obama's inauguration, which says what?  
Exactly, they had no reason not to, unless being black was the underlying issue which is not the color of their rainbow.  Look, before you start yelling rascist, if Trump can say it, so can I...but then my rights do not count in this ongoing debate!"
I got a king and and a queen. What you got? I got a king and a race card. Once you go black you cannot go back its called reverse racism.
"Yes and this same ""reporter"" doesn't see anything wrong with 11 out of 13 players on the average NBA team being Black.  Imagine what she would say if it was the other way around.
The left has been grasping at anything to label President Trump as racist, and if he is then the Party must be racist, and of course all the people that voted for him are also racist.  They think the average Joe out there can't see through their hate.  But, we do."

"We as a nation created a system to keep people down ?  Where did Schultz get this twisted logic from--Black Lives Matters ?  Thanks to living in America we all have a chance to be all we can be.  It's not our fault or responsibility if people choose  to waste their lives away. The only group who has hurt society is the democrats who work to create a class of people who expect government / taxpayers to pull their share of the load for them to buy their votes . Absent from Schultz story is the most basic human truth : we all have responsibility to ourselves for our own survival . Simply put, if you don't work , you shouldn't eat . Why doesn't Schultz even mention people helping themselves ?  If you go get a moose to feed your family , you don't owe the guy next door who sat on his lazy rear end half your moose. Everyone needs help sometime--but not all the time. Around 40 percent want everyone else to pay their share.  Those screaming about health care are the one's wanting it for free ."
"Then I hope to god the likes of you are never around when a woman is under threat from a man as you will be more worried about how ladylike her behaviour is than the fact that she, and/or her bevy of little kids are being intimidated, assaulted and bullied.

"Careful, Hedges also called the ""black block"":  

""... people who have been cast aside by the cruelty of corporate capitalism, have embraced holy war. Their lives, battered by economic misery and social marginalization, have suddenly been filled with meaning. They hold themselves up as the vanguard of the oppressed. They arrogate to themselves the right to use force to silence those they define as the enemy. They sanctify anger. They're infected with the dark, adrenaline-driven urge for confrontation that arises among the disenfranchised when a democracy ceases to function. They're separated, as Sigmund Freud wrote of those who engage in fratricide, by the “narcissism of minor differences.” They mirror each other, not only ideologically but also physically—armed and dressed in black, the color of fascism and the color of death.""

"Colin Kaepernick kneeled down in protest during the National Anthem at NFL games because of the systematic harassment and murder of black citizens by police.
 

Protest is a proud American tradition, but Donald Trump wants NFL team owners to fire any player who kneels in protest.

"You forgot a little item called the supremacy clause of the Constitution which gives the Federal law jurisdiction over the states or local governments-especially on issues like civil rights. Our entire system relies on the integrity of the voting system and the principle of one man, one vote. One miscast fraudulent vote can negate the vote of another lawful citizen and deprive folks of their equality of constitutional rights. 
After all, if the Federal government could not intervene in such issues, blacks would still deprived of their voting rights in the South. 
And if the fifty states were allowed to run their own elections without any oversight by the Justice Department we would have 50 little fiefdoms running sham elections and corrupt governments.

"Better to simply treat them as the temporary installations that they are. 

Motague himself was ready to paint over the Brown mural. The attachment to these paintings is feigned. By Montague for wanting to keep ""his"" space, and by the black community for yet another opportunity to play the victim.

But hey, you guys keep threatening lawsuits and see who lets you paint anything else. The entire mural scene will be reduced to a handful of professional painters, none of whom will be painting questionable political stuff."
"As I am already 68, I personally know what happened in the 60's because I lived it.  The democrats, both North and South, have always been the racist bigots that they remain today.  As LBJ was merging with the evil progressives, they needed a new way to control the Black citizens, so he came up with the ""Great Society"" and a bunch of other socialist ideas to entrap the poor people in our Republic, promising all kinds of wonderful things, but still needing the Republicans to pass his Civil Rights Bill, because the democrats, both North and South refused to go along with any idea of integration of the races.  The wonderful Robert Bird of West Virginia even filibustered against it!  I seem to remember how Hillary praised him as her mentor, but I could be mistaken(?)  Then there is Senator Fulbright, a very strong and vocal KKK member, who was the mentor of a certain William Jefferson Clinton.  But we all know that Bill was considered the ""first Black President"".  So when the democrats."
"What an incredible farce for Canada to put in everyone's face it's the epitome of inclusion in these troubled times. You're about 50 years behind the U.S. and the reason inclusion looks so natural in Canada is that the majority rules with an iron fist and you're doing things that wouldn't be tolerated in much of the western world.
And you have the audacity to criticize  groups like Black Lives Matter?"
Mr. McCoy should go back to where he came from and stop bringing killers to Hawaii. His black man defense is weak and ignorant.
Here we have another story proving that all lives don't matter in this country. Roof is a product of our society. It was easier for him to get a gun than a good education. We built that. We know there are innocent people on death row. We have never had equal protection under the law and justice for all. I would prefer that Roof spend the rest of his life sharing a prison with black inmates.
"Thanks for thoughtful discussion.  One would hope that all of us who call ourselves Catholic might make the distinction between those who are dying for their faith and those who are being inconvenienced by their faith.

Sullivan (a lawyer) knows that Pence can not be president. The people have picked Trump. Lisa voted for the bank bailout and she is the one that they coined the acronym RINO after. Both Sullivan and Lisa are part of the anti American globalist agenda. Sullivan was backed by outside money and ran for Senate here because it was cheaper than Ohio.Both are RINOs and corporatists bought and paid for by globalists. Now they reveal their true motives and can support by default the criminal Clinton while pretending to be politically correct. It is disingenuous and they are liars. Trump represents change from a globalist agenda to an America First agenda. This is what is feared by those in control as they see their power slipping. Stand by Trump and take back our country.

"I have to believe that was Chatwoods last chance as a starter here. Maybe a reliever is where he is better suited now. 

He is a free agent following the season and in a playoff race you cannot continue to throw away games in which he starts.  I do put this one on Black for allowing him to remain in the game when it was clear what was going on. 

Just didn't get it last night...to allow him to throw the game away for a very winnable game against a poor starter and a 5 run lead. I assume Black wanted to give him every chance but come on...not in a playoff race."

In answer to a pageant question, she stated she did not believe healthcare was a ""right"", but a ""privilege"".  Anyone unemployed didn't ""deserve"" healthcare paid by those who are employed. If the question and answer carried any actual weight in the voting, Miss AK should have won instead of this privileged individual's idiotic response to the key question.  Plus she wasn't as pretty as Miss AK."

My favorite politician (believe it or not, there are some good ones) is the fantastic Pramila Jayapal. I don't love her because she's a woman or a person of color, I love her for her courage and her progressive stance. I'm happy she represents me in Congress. 
And for Port of Seattle Position 1, I am a firm supporter of Ryan Calkins, who opposed the ""Shelling"" of the Port. I don't care what color he is - I don't know what he looks like. I am also proud to support Pat Murakami for City Council. I don't support her because she's a woman. I support her because she gives a damn about neighborhoods, not developers."

"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest. I'll save my sympathy on those who deserve it."

"Statements only make sense in context. 

We know the context, i.e. ongoing debate about the title Master, and the status of the people involved. 

One academic made a comment to some students, referring to the title of a second academic, i.e. ""Master"", and pointing out the incongruity of the students sharing the table, as equals, as Fellows, with this academic Master, and how that actual, current status had nothing to do with some long ago disappeared ""slave master"". 

Perfectly normal academic banter about academic politics. It would have been the same wording had the students not been black. But being black, they chose to take offence, and that is what changed everything. 

Which again points out the irony that those who were once oppressed are now the ones with the power, undergraduates making respected academics tremble."

"""...nearly half surveyed (48 percent) prefer the additional revenue come from the general excise tax. ""

I'm curious as to why everyone is preferring a GET increase? If residents believe that by raising the GET they won't be footing the bill, they are sorely mistaken. A rise in GE tax would only pass the burden on to residents. Companies will not foot the increase on their own, they will pass the burden on to the consumers (most of the time, the increase in pricing will not be proportional to the % increase in tax i.e. you will be paying for the increase and then some).
The state should pursue other options mentioned by Caldwell, including calling on the federal gov. to ""pony up"" more in contribution's proportionate to the cost increase and calling on the private sector to contribute (see Ala Moana), being that they will be receiving some benefit from the rail."

""So, go and vote and then go check out areas because a lot of bad things happen, and we don't want to lose for that reason.""

He was speaking to his loyal xenophobes and referring to the two wankers who play ""New Black Panther Party"" dressup, standing outside a Philadelphia polling place, every four years. The media shows up for this goofy duo like it does annually for Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, PA.

The truth is, those lames have never changed anyone's vote. It's a 99% black precinct where The Donald is polling at zero-point-zero.  But when he gets hammered, he can claim the election was ""stolen."""
"What exactly are you appalled about? Afghanistan's Taliban government  provided material support for Al Qaeda to invade the US and to kill thousands of people in New York. The Taliban was breaching every human rights law on the planet at the time (you may recall the Taliban blowing up ancient Buddhist statues and stoning women to death in football stadiums). What exactly is it about Afghanistan in 2001 that inspired your better democratic modern sensibilities? Or are you a fan or proponent of austere medieval religious death cults ruling countries. 

Afghanistan deserved to be invaded. Iraq did not. This was Bush's mistake. And Canada, as a signatory to Article 5 of NATO, had to join the US invasion of Afghanistan. It is a requirement under the mutual defence provisions of NATO's Charter. The problem with Afghanistan is that it is hopelessly mired in the ancient superstition of Islam. It will take hundreds of years to shed this black death cult."

"Not true. I had a very close relationship with a black family who lived in a cul de sac across from me when I moved into this house nearly 29 years ago.  The first neighbors to welcome us to the neighborhood.  We used to play poker together every month.  His name was Kirby, and he had been the production manager for Robinson Dairy before he started his own business, ""Kirby's Frozen Yogurt.""  A few years after we moved in, Kirby showed up a bit late for our poker game.  I said, ""Hey, Kirby, I just saw the ""for sale"" sign in front of your house!  Every house in the neighborhood just went up 20% in market value 'cause the darkies are moving out!""  He thought that was hilarious.  He was moving to a neighborhood about a mile away where the houses were worth more than twice as much to get a better class of neighbors.

No one wanted a war in Europe in the '30's....unfortunately two individuals did, Hitler and Stalin,  both conspired to precipitate WWII.

Just like Hitler and Stalin, there is one person in North Korea who may well want to precipitate a war .

He is the one with ICBMissiles , he who has nuclear war heads, who has been testing his missiles by shooting them over Japan and has threatened repeatedly to shoot his missiles to hit the USA and its allies.

If he initiates a war, President Trump would, quite rightly, end it."

""Slate's audience is ranked as one of the most liberal when compared to other mainstream media outlets.  Slate is also known (and sometimes criticized) for adopting contrarian positions, giving rise to the term ""Slate Pitches"".  

I have to agree with most of the decisions and positions of those prosecutors cited in the article.

The US Supreme Court has upheld our Jury system numerous times and our death penalty standards as well.

The number of convicted black people is pretty much equal to the number of black people committing the crimes.  And most of those crimes are against other black people, from drive-bys where six year old girls are killed, multiple murders and assaults outside strip joints and gang fights over drugs and prostitution. to just cover this year's Portland crime scene."
"For a Liberal Lefty to accuse Trump of not telling the truth is like the kettle calling the pot black. Not ""yammer on"" , just drawing attention to the duplicity of the Liberals or is that not allowed by this  Government."
"The MIC is alive and well.  As an example, it is supplying much of the Saudi weaponry up to and including the jets bombing Yemen as we speak.   

The MIC will also continue to do well on the big ticket items like your  aircraft carrier as long as there are people like President Putin flexing their military muscle in Syria and showing off Their new military vessels in the Black Sea and the Mediterranean.  YOu do recall that there is just a teensy little problem in the Ukraine and NATO treaty members near Russia, do you not?

The Chinese building their island fortress in the South China Sea in land claimed by, among others, our ally Japan, will also keep the MIC healthy.  

The North Korean nuclear threat is not going to go away by itself, either.  The MIC will continue to prepare to continue that war which is only in a cease fire, after all."

This is not Canada ...with a bunch of « Loyalists » Orangemen.  
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada.
After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…
	
And Paf ! Problems started across French Canada ever since !"
"Thank God for video proof! Again, LEO lies about why they shot an unarmed black man. People just assume LEO always tell the truth, when time after time they are caught lying about what really happened. Clearly, this is another example where LEO was involved in a shooting and they shooter straighten lied to save his sorry ass. Why lie? It seems to me the officer knew they should not have used deadly force and they tried to save their ass and blame the dead. 

Side note: 
Why the f%#^ can't cops kill sexual predators and child abusers? Am I asking too much of LEO??"
"If the man was a nigger, he should have been shot, not punched!"
They have already started to turn on each other.  There's a couple of videos of an Antifa activist haranguing protesters in Seattle for not physically attacking the police and the conservative marchers.  And then there is another of an Antifa activist punching a member of Black Lives Matter in Dallas.  The Purity Patrol is on the march!
"And Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize before he entered office. Depending on whom you ask and what time of day you ask it, Obama did more to kill terrorists than Bush. Obama was adored by Hollywood and mainstream media.

Obama was this country's first President with African American roots. It was and is a major historical event. Like him or not, it doesn't change that fact. Is it really surprising that more people wanted to be part of that kind of history? We will never have another first black president.

Keep trying to use that to promote your agenda of being anti-Trump.  I did not support or want him as president. I prefered another Republican.  Many Republicans wanted another candidate.  If Trump gets re-reelected in 4 years it will be because he was successful. I for one hope he gets reelected because that means the country is better off than it is now."
"Here is your assignment for today - look up Mizoram, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Tripura and Sikkim. The people from those states are ethnically from the Tibetan family, which here your type calls Asian. There are also Anglo-Indians (like Russel Peters) who are from mixed European and Indian heritages. There are Siddis who are black Africans, and aboriginals in the Andaman and Nicobar islands, who are related to the aboriginals in Australia. 

I think that covers the major ethnic groups. I am guessing your knowledge of India is less than my knowledge of neurosurgery. Except that I don't think I am qualified to make comments on neurosurgery, while you think you can make (fairly uninformed) comments on India. 

Like they say, a little knowledge is a dangerous thing. You are a awesome example of that."

"And why should the President of the United states not have the right to speak out to his beliefs ? Isn't that what this is all about ? The right to stand (or sit) for what you believe ? There are a lot of people out there who are applauding Trumps position on this. 

Unfortunately here we are not allowed to talk about or try to reconcile  police violence against blacks because the Globe censors discussion on it. But do your own homework on the issue. There are never absolutes in life but in my opinion mitigating reasons why so many black men fall prey to cop violence. And change comes with discussion not censorship."
"The sometimes negative reaction to the announcement of a female Doctor Who, just goes to show that the struggle against misogyny is far from over. Even the science fiction nerds of the world are not free from bias. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black."
"His motivation? Well he was active in politics until the DNC pushed out his man, he then immersed himself in what his local official was doing, which is exactly what our local folks are doing, voting lockstep with the GOP. Maybe he saw the loss of clean water and air, healthcare and tax giveaways to the rich as anti American since it looks like pay to play like many another Banana Republic where everything is rigged against you, maybe he had a Black friend whose family had been treated like this since they were dragged to the land of freedom where the rich had everything and the poor had nada. Perhaps he was decended from the indentured class that only got food enough to survive on and cast off clothing from dead people for 7 years of slavery. Maybe he had 58,000 of his peer group killed in nam for no reason, or had friends that were disabled vet's that couldn't get decent medical care from another silly and pointless  conflict.
Maybe he tried to live like a real Christian....powerless"
"Thank you, Mike. The fact that there was no ""legal framework"" for slavery in Virginia in most of the first half of the 17th century, only indentured servitude, doesn't mean the conditions and brutality were not indistinguishable from slavery elsewhere in the Americas.  In addition, those first Africans were taken as slaves by Europeans, and they arrived with no ability whatsoever to determine their own fate.  Their work was brutal, as would be the work and suffering of future slaves in the south. To say that they were not slaves, but indentured servants, is to give full weight, again, to only one side of event, the European side, the side of magical labels, the side that forces all understanding through a single, limited worldview.  I'm pretty sure the Africans couldn't tell much difference between the two states, especially given that they were captured into slavery, not indentured servitude."
"Agree with every word!

There are certainly reasonable grounds to criticise Quebec's new law, but to ignore or deny the regressive, misogynist, and anti-western message conveyed by Muslim veils is willful self-deception.

"""...a half-century ago that was precipitated by the Democratic Party's decision to support the equal rights of African Americans.""    -that's historically false. The Democratic Party has attempted to block and impede all efforts to desegregate and integrate African Americans and impart those respective rights to vote-- up to and through ""a half century ago.""
.
AND What's more-- once Democrats accepted the fact that blacks' right to vote and integrate into significant segments of society was a certainty, they shifted their focus to instead implementing as MANY Liberal Socialist policies as they could onto them, this ensuring: A) votes and B) social dependence for decades to come.  Baltimore, Detroit, and Chicago are modern-day casualties of those failed social programs.  A 5-second Google search both confirms this, and articulates the quote LBJ famously gave about implementing social programs to secure the black vote."
"You respected the opinion of a racist segregationist enough to elect him to lead the ""free"" world. I put ""free"" in quotes because Trump didn't think black Americans should be free to live where they want. This is the stuff of leadership? This is what we want representing our citizenry and our country abroad? A guy who was busted for ILLEGAL housing discrimination and racial discrimination?

I wish more people would be a little less tolerant of racism today. At least when segregationist George Wallace ran for national office he didn't even earn his party's nomination. Fast forward to 2016 and Republicans not only nominated Trump, they elected the segregationist to lead us. Tells me a lot about the values of the modern Segregationist Southern Strategy... I mean Republican Party."
"The few blacks who came to Oregon to attend school are definitely a minority.  Times change, though.

When I was at Duck U Law School, there were only four women law students; now it's 206 male and 160 female. 

There were no blacks then; now there are 9.  And total minority is 67. out of the 366 total.  

The only other minority I recall when I was there was a guy who was Native American and he had already served as an Officer in a submarine and was also a CPA, so he kinda stood out!"
"Again, you are completely ignoring the history of racism in Hollywood.

"Because immigration laws are rules of exclusion, and progressives go crazy when you mention any exclusion (except ""black safe zones"" or black-only student centers) or any rule that runs in favor of traditional America.

"Maybe walking across the street close to the local bar just after closing time while wearing black clothes wasn't the smartest thing in the world to do. Maybe when you saw that oncoming car weaving back and forth across the center line when you were driving, it would have been prudent to move over to the right as far as possible and reduce your speed. More generally, remember the old adage that applies to drivers and, especially, to pedestrians ""you can be dead right, or dead wrong; you're dead either way"". This is very similar in intent to the advice given women on how to avoid sexual assault; protect yourself first, and worry about who is in the wrong later."
"That was then, this is now.  Get over it already.  Blacks get beaten and killed nowadays by other blacks.

Tribal custom is also a serious issue here.  Grew up in the Transkei, so I have been a witness to the atrocities committed by the Xhosa men upon their women. Abuse is an accepted norm, amongst the amaBantu.  Now go on,  tell me I am a racist!!"
"There have been many ""Unjust"" Laws, example Democrat Governor Wallace Racist Segregationist State Laws.

After the scandal broke that Democrat Senator Thurmond had a Negro Child, the Democrats kicked him out of the Democratic Party, he then fled to the Republican Party.  Previously, 1950s, the Democratic Party was nearly destroyed by the Republican Presidential Candidate Eisenhower becoming U.S. President, the U.S. Congress' House UnAmerican Activities Committees made the U.S. Socialist Party and U.S. Communist Party Illegal, they fled to the Democratic Party and became the Majority, and modeled the Democratic Party after Chancellor Hitler's National Socialist German Worker's Party a Political Labor Union (like the U.S. Labor Unions did 1930s)."
"Trump is a master deal maker, negotiater and strategist. He built a great company and employs thousands of people, some whom are tremedous people, even hispanics, whom he loves but also the blacks, he employs several of them too.  He knows how to make a deal, a great deal not a bad deal, some of the worst deals ever made, were made by Obama and Trump only makes the best deals, believe me.  Trump also knows how to build things, like a great wall so tall, Mexicans can only get over it with a long rope.  He is an expert at ecommunication so when he feels the need to tell the truth to the people he sends a series of tweets that will unify and inform his base  but also put his enemies on their heels as he effortlessly manuevers the field of 140 characters.  He will also deal with a Nuclear Threat by tweet, since it will ultimately intimidate his adversaries. Thanks Murica, and as far as Trump being the greatest president of all time like his base claims, I guess, we'll see."

"Huh? The Christian religion was formed in the first century so are you saying Christian ideas are even less valid? And Judaism goes back even further so maybe that's even more irrelevant. Don't even mention Hinduism which is something like 7,000 years old. Or how about Socrates and Aristotle who lived over 2,000 years ago. Shakespeare wrote about 400 years ago which isn't that much more recent than Islam so maybe we shouldn't pay much attention to him either.

What modern philosophies do you follow? Where do you find spiritual guidance? Drake? Bieber?

Anyway, nobody is calling you a racist for what you described. We think you're racist because you're intolerant of people who are different from you. Oh, hey, that actually does make you a bigot!"
"Unlikely that you can be enlightened, but perhaps I can attempt it.

The US was founded by men who believed in self government, and the notion that government's role is to serve man, rather than the opposite. One of the ideals of freedom is the right of citizens to peacefully protest injustice.  It's an inalienable right laid out in the Declaration of Independence, and codified in the Constitution. The soldiers who have fought and died in our military did so to support these ideals.  

Perhaps rather than snarling at these men who have chosen to respectfully protest you can take a moment to reflect on their situation, and try to imagine what it would be like to walk in their shoes. Think about a time when a black man couldn't use the same restroom as you, eat at a restaurant or ride in the front of a bus. Think of what it would be like to be sitting in your car as a legal concealed weapon holder, and have a cop shoot you for following the law, purely out of fear of your skin color."

"I agree for the most part and  hope 3rd parties can pull 20-30% this election.  Trump is a little douchey and Clinton, bless her soul a complete train wreak!  I don't like the way the media has tried to bury Bernie and Trump and Trump is still standing so I'm going for him.  Case and point, media makes him out to be anti-women, anti-black. I judge people by what they do not what they've said. What he's done is hire and promote women and blacks within his organization.  This testimony from a black woman that works for him is case and point. Trump hasn't publicized this because they didn't want her endorsement out of respect for her father (Trumps friend, famous black doctor) and the fact she had a coke habit Trump wanted to keep on the down low ...he's ""gangsta"" like that, takes care of his own, very loyal, and I respect that and the fact neither he or his kids drink or use drugs BUT they obviously don't judge or throw those that do under the bus.  http://tinyurl.com/j6tus2b"

"Roman Catholic Women Priests, most of them, have the same Divinity Degrees required from the same Universities-they are trained.  Priest training is not a clandestine training.  Anyone can look up class curriculum and agendas and satisfy this training on their own with similar procedures as the seminaries use.

You are correct, sexism like racism is a form of hatred.  So when our church treats women less than men & strips them of their sacred rights to equal sacraments, it is an act of hatred & sin to do so, just as much as stripping a black man from his right to be a priest based on his skin color would be an act of hatred.  

We have sinned in the past.  Some our church's orders owned black slaves in America.  I will call hatred hate, and sexism is hatred. 

Our laws demand we treat all the same and follow the Great Commandment as a dogma and our Canon Law then states, as mere doctrine or tradition, we ordain only men.  Canon law cannot support attacks against anyone's human dignity."
"The Louisiana problem is precisely the same as Alaska's.  The Koch brothers in particular got an incompetent governor elected and with redistricting, a similarly inept legislative majority. The Kochs even got judges elected to appeal courts. 

The did it the same way:  Hollering about ""abortion,"" ""homosexuals,""  ""regulations,"" and ""taxes,"" red meat issues that appealed to the lowest information voters.  

They even permanently exported a great deal of the state's black population post-Katrina, most of them to the Houston area.

They got what they paid for: Tax givebacks and progressively more insufficient oversight of industry and business.

Piyush Jindal tried to paper those problems over by selling state assets. Everything went on the block: Schools, bridges, prisons,roads, even the state capitol buildings.

The only reason they have a decent, competent governor now, is because Vitter couldn't stop  patronizing prostitutes and some of the fundamentalist right had a problem with that."

"Keep it up, as I and many others I know are using our rights to completely tune you out and will continue.  There is not over 500 killings in Chicago almost all black men.  So get to the places that are truly in trouble and walk the streets, donate some of the average 1.4 million that football players make to improving the communities that bred the killings.

"Firstly I do not defend the old flag. There are not enough comment characters available for proper, clear debate. Secondly my problem with this article is the continued attack on anything Afrikaans by mostly libtard journalists and opinionistas. Thirdly my biggest gripe is with the apparent want by these writers to deny history and write certain segments of society who are part of this country and history from history. Fourthly their hypocrisy of pointing out the wrongs of the past but then suggesting same oppressive remedies is sickening. Such as the removal of ANY symbols of a group and their identity or attacking their language and culture CONSTANTLY. How is that any different from past attacks on the dignity and culture of black South Africans? Lastly your example of a Hitler statue in TelAviv is not the same. If you said in Berlin it would be more accurate. There are hardly any non-Jewish Germans living in Tel Aviv or Israel or having played a direct role in the history of Israel."

"So much terrible violence was done by those awful liberal counter-protesters in Charlottesville.  

There was the grusome beating of the Emancipation Park lawn by the feet of counter-protesters fleeing Richard Preston as he shot at them.  

There was the despicable damage done to James Field's beautiful car by Heather Heyer's body and the bodies of 19 other vicious counter-protesters as he mowed them down in it.  

And of course there is the impending dismantling of Robert E Lee's gorgeous metallic horsey-riding likeness, ending it's all too brief 93 year run of intimidating the black citizens of Charlottesville and celebrating Lee's unsuccessful attempt to destroy America and perpetuate slavery with a war that killed close to 1 million people.

We must stop these liberals from abusing our lawns with their feet as they flee gun violence, wrecking our cars with their bodies as we run them over and destroying our horsey-riding statues to our enemies' slavery-championing war heros!"

"It's also fair to say that race-based hate-groups can be laid squarely at the feet of Obama's win, Obama himself and an inflammatory media that sought conflagration of racial divide where it could.

Remember that Obama's win was analyzed through demographics above all else, and that the impact of his win on the living standards of African-Americans came to the forefront repeatedly. Distaste of Obama was placed squarely on racism. And then, when racial tensions did break out, the President was portrayed as anti-cop, pro-BLM and sympathetic to protestors.

The moment Trump was associated with the alt-right by the media, America's hopes at unity were demolished."
"No offense but Mr. Trump wasn't the one putting people in that ""basket of deplorables"".  And he wasn't the one sending people into his rallies to deliberately pick fights.  Nor was he the one calling people racist/xenophobic/whatever at the drop of a hat nor the one who had supporters who would block people from walking down the sidewalk if you were the wrong race (one group of Black Lives Matter protesters).  I don't think he's the divider here.  Which is about the only decent thing I can say about him."
"The 97 year old is correct. he and others fought for that right. The president and fans also have a right to disagree and make their feelings known.

"You both are wrong.  Police need reasonable suspicion that a person is engaged in a crime or about to commit a crime.  If a person is hanging outside a store that has been robbed, the police can articulate the need to stop and determine his dealings.  It's called a Terry Stop and has been confirmed legal several times by the Supreme Court.  You need Probable Cause to arrest a person for a crime you suspect them of committing.  A warrant doesn't even come into effect until the person has not shown for court or has been found to be charged by a District Attorney.  The community is woefully inept on what actually the law is that they have built their opinions around innuendo and guessing.  I'm glad  someone finally wrote an article from another perspective, now they need to delve into why the black community is contacted by the police more than any other race and more inclined to be involved in a deadly encounter."
"That man is a Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorist in my opinion and should be prosecuted to the highest degree. But he is no different, no less deadly in intent or actual achievement, than the other lone wolf terrorist attacks we have had here.

"It’s just a weird series of coincidences based on his not knowing any better that he hired a bunch of Nazis to his staff, won’t distance himself from the Klan, hired Kobach and Hans von Spakovsky and Jeff Sessions and his only governing principle is overturning everything President Black Man did.
Really, it’s sad because he just means well and is in over his head."
Why beat around the bush? Do you hate blacks yes or no? Do you oppose racial discrimination towards blacks yes or no? Bet you won't answer that directly and unequivocally.
"I have my doubts about the 'secret society', but lets say the rest of your post is true. That still does not disprove that tech is a meritocracy. If you want to talk about  systemic issues that are preventing women from achieving their full potential in tech I'm all ears, but saying that tech is not a meritocracy is saying that there are women who are elite and are still getting turned away at the door by the gatekeepers at Microsoft, Google etc. There is no proof that this is happening.

 Nobody doubts that black people have the ability to succeed at hockey. There are plenty of elite back players already (Subban, Igilna, Jones, Simmonds etc).
The reason why they are not in the NHL in greater numbers is lack of access/lack of interest. Not enough rinks in their communities, cost is high, they prefer football...whatever the case. They don't demand spots in the NHL simply because they have the potential to be good, because that's not how a meritocracy works."

I am a very proud member and volunteer attorney for the ACLU.  Since you have made it your life's work to remain absolutely and completely ignorant about the Constitution, nothing I write here will be absorbed by you.  But others may actually want to learn something.

With very few exceptions - like if Google said they would not host a web site because the owner is black, for instance - Google has no obligation to host any web site for anyone.  You (remarkably) keep making the same First Amendment mistakes you always make here.  The Constitution limits the power of government - not the power of private companies.  If the web site owner was arrested and jailed because of his loathsome views, the ACLU would defend him.  Enjoy marinating in your ignorance."

"No, they just murder Black people going to Church"
"Precisely the point, Trump is pitching this ridiculous standard established by the Obama and his ilk that made sure in PC fashion, that every photo had at least one Asian, African American, Woman ....and the list goes on REGARDLESS of qualification. It was a false reality that ignored the competitive environment that made our country great. Like Trump or not and I'll acknowledge he can make it difficult at times, he's on the right track in moving us to a place where the best person gets the job period. As it should be."

"""But political correctness is silly, nothing more. It starts with a humane instinct, not to offend, and takes it too far. The response is to educate.

The response is not to create a political movement whose principal object is to be offensive.""

"Even if he DID call the cops, against her wishes, they couldn't have done anything about it. Reporting a crime against a third party, free of corroborating evidence - of which there was none - is not actionable as it's investigative-hearsay. It's not like seeing a crime on the news and saying 'I know that guy, I'm going to call in a tip,' that's offering third-party information to aid in an investigation. Here, there wasn't an investigation, as there was no report of a crime.
Kizsla is salivating over every purported act of impropriety around CU. Could you imagine his mock outrage had CU taken against Tumpkin, based on the available information: ""CU's racist policies call for black coach to be fired based on unsubstantiated reports!"" Or, ""CU deprives black coach of due-process!"" The slander/libel lawsuits that Tumpkin would have (regardless of his actual involvement) had would dwarf the current allegations - and Kizsla would have been drooling the whole time. He's a pathetic individual"

"The saw about politics applies to all of it: the process of making a bill, like that of a sausage, ain't pretty. 
Politics is a blood-sport. Everyone gets splashed, mangled, transformed.
But a democratic republic is the best system ever devised. Imagine if liberals/progressives had refused to vote until the perfect (whatever that could mean) candidate came along. We'd be a country to the right of Putin's Russia by now.
Any observer of American history must see that progress always has come slowly---------- but it HAS come.
I align myself with those who feel that a society should be judged by how it treats its least powerful citizens. African-Americans, during my lifetime, have vastly improved their lives, overall, but a long struggle remains.

Black Lives Matter, Idle No More, Sexual Violence Against Women, Missing and Murdered Aboriginal Women, Islamophobia, Climate Change...... Is he going to fix them all?"
"One of your good Catholics just shot up a Masjid day before yesterday.  Another good Christian named Frazier Glen Cross shot three people to death in front of a Jewish Community Center in Kansas City, MO two years ago.  And still another fine upstanding Christian named Anders Breivik slaughtered 77 Norwegians in the name of Christian supremacy just six years ago.  And your good Christian ""Knights"" beheaded a black man in Texas ten years before that.  And I defy you to come up with ANY quantitative data that Muslims ANYWHERE have generated a body-count anywhere near that of the so-called ""Christian"" nations since WWII.

And kindly don't lump me with a group of murdering heretics that want to kill me and my family.  It makes no more sense than lumping black families with the sheet-wearers who want to lynch them.  A Shi'a scholar near my in-laws was murdered by the Da'esh for publicly denouncing their murder of Iraqi Christians.  Their victim was practicing ISLAM.  His murderers WEREN'T."

By contrast, my grandfather lived through the war and while his family was evacuated to the country where there was a  thriving black market, all his kids had running sores by war's end due to malnutrition.  He was only allowed to enter Canada with his 9 children by signing on as a farm hand for a year.  The pay was a tiny house, $50/month, and all the milk his family could drink..  The kids were teased for their clothes and accents.

But he wasn't bitter about it, nor did he think anyone owed him anything.  When his stint as a farm hand ended, he bought a tiny farm and worked it happily til he died.  Each of his children went on to raise happy families of their own.

He got kicked hard but got up again -- with no handouts."

"Just off the top of my noggin'...

I would guess that the 9K+ initial cost is well worth the investment and will pay for themselves pretty quickly.

When you look at the next 20 years+ and the cost of elections. It seems to me that the biannual ritual has fits and requires single issue ballots, special elections etc., will be the true 'value'. The object of the game is make sure 100% of the voters has easy access to the information, and then at the ballot box. OK, I hear you...Not if you are on the red team...They prefer the opposite, nobody votes who is unworthy. Like, for example, ""low information voters"", women and black people and especially black women who is a ""low information voter"" are excluded.

Also, seems to me I recall the red team wanting to privatise the post office because it's losing money. Unpaid ballots are on the taxpayers tab. Over time we'd save money there too.

The yearly maintenance might even pay for itself.

I'm just tossing out ideas, no real information."
Football is destroying itself.  Not by the players who chose to protest against Blacks being slaughtered by our police but by the constant pursuit of profits by the NFL.  A football game is 60 minutes.  Longer if it goes into overtime.  But it takes generally now 3 + hours for a game to be completed.  Disgusting.  Soccker is so much better.  Less predictable too.

"Not being black, I have no basis for commenting. However, I remember treating Obama respectfully, voting for him once but not twice, based on results, mostly because we needed more than a celebrity-in-chief (my, oh, my, those were the days). He then did better and earned my esteem, but my not being black, that doesn't matter.
Treating the office with respect, regardless of its occupant, has always seemed the prudent approach, though that had been tested when reciprocity was turned on its head by the redefining of words such as ""sex"" and ""is,"" thereby challenging this father of young, inquisitive daughters. Not being black, I chalked that up to the turbulent era of the '90s that gave us such spectacles as Clarence Thomas, Rodney King and O.J. with a dollop of Tonya Harding for comic relief. And CNN rejoiced.
Tamping down the rhetoric is an inside job, but not being black, I can't suggest how others should behave. That wouldn't be fair."

"Stop unlawful police killings/harassment of people of color and the kneeling during the anthem will stop.  It was never a problem until a handful of police officers started murdering unarmed black men.  That's where this started.

As to black-on-black violence (or any other group-on-group), that is a different subject than police-on-people violence. If that distinction can't be seen, it's really hard to stay on topic, as the guidelines for this site recommend. There is a difference between dissing a topic and trying to stay on one topic at a time, yes?"
"I am not quite sure what you are trying to say.  But I think you are looking at it from the wrong end.  A business open to the public, Masterpiece Cakeshop, is refusing to provide a cake for a gay couple.  The business is not participating in a religious ceremony, nor is it practicing a religion.  (Businesses do not have religions.)  Since it is open to the public, it may no more discriminate against gays than a diner in the South could lawfully refuse to serve black people."
"Clearly, the man that was shot didn't follow the officers instructions. He was ordered to stop and go to his knees for 15 seconds before he ended up getting shot. That is 15 seconds he decided to NOT follow the officers orders. No, that isn't punishable by death, but if he reached into the car after 15 seconds of disobeying, then that is.

I believe the black community is stuck in a cycle that they need help to get out of (better education, etc). That being said, they still make the decisions they do that perpetuate the cycle. The black community as a whole needs to take control of their community and work together to fix items within their control. Remember, they decide(statistically as a group) to drop out of school, have kids at a young age, not go to college, or not to obey an officers orders. I've known many black men that chose to go to college and better their lives. They are the same men that choose to obey an officer. They are very successful as well, because they chose to be!"
Some are always ready to defend the rich and powerful against those trying to survive and keep their communities.  The police defend the rich and powerful and were doing so during this protest which was defending the black community.

Far too many.  

""Why don't we focus our energies on black on black violence in the inner city.""

You mean the cops you just defended aren't focused on that?   Well there's our problem right there.  Instead of beating and sometimes murdering black people maybe cops should focus on enforcing the law.

And personally I'm more worried about the police than I am about black people.

Black people just aren't that scary to me.   Cops who violate civil rights, ignore crime and sometimes even murder people under color of the law are much more dangerous, especially where I live."

"I agree with Ace, and I think you are wrong.  It's different this time.  There is the evidence of our own eyes based on what is going on in Europe where mass waves of African and Middle East migrants have entered, failed to assimilate, self segregate, and engage in criminal and violent behaviour at rates vastly beyond those of the general population.  There is also a religious / cultural element here that as much as people want to ignore, remains a factor.  Then, there is the issue of numbers.  There were never this many jews, Vietnamese, or Hungarians trying to enter the West all at once, there was time to assimilate, and there was much less contact with the home country once they came here, so they assimilated better and more quickly.  There was less government support for them, so they had to enter the workforce quickly. Now the more children they make, the more support they get.

It is easy to suggest that no companies hire anyone with a criminal background. But Oregon is ground zero for the black market. If you deny these people the ability to use their skillset for good legal ways, they will use them for bad illegal ways. That's the reality.

"In July of 2016, an avowed black nationalist murdered five police officers during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Dallas, Texas. The act of violence was well-planned and was motivated entirely by the hate-filled ideology of the shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson.

With several officers dead by the hand of a committed black nationalist, one might think the Obama administration may have considered the assassinations domestic terror and launched an investigation into groups associated with this ideology.

Not at all.

Barack Obama condemned the shootings, but he did not call out or even allude to Johnson’s hateful views. He did, however, blame “powerful weapons” for the violence.

They had played themselves right back into it (with help, admittedly, from the Padres) and then crapped the bed the last two weeks."
May be true but the movement arose due to the number of police who killed young blacks.  Police should not be killing American citizens.
"We gave it away a long time ago, Pitts.  It does nothing for your cause to argue it so disingenuously.

Terrorism, contrary to popular belief, didn't start on Sept. 11, 2001, nor did U.S. torture policies, which have been more or less with us since the beginning; from frontier ""justice,"" through our various wars, and finally packaged and exported through the School of the Americas(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation), to name one modern example.

What about the other 9/11, and CIA complicity in the Allende coup?  Black ops go back a long way, from regime change in Iran in the 50's to the dirty wars in Central and South America in the 70's and 80's, and elsewhere.  

You want to make a real case against torture, and terror?  Draw some real lines between cause and effect:  The world that U.S. policies of destabilization, terror, and military force have created, and the mess our children will be left to deal with."

Good grief.  If you want to accuse, then accuse.  Have the courage of your convictions.  Tell us the names of the groups that Kurtz, et al. are involved in; how those groups are ""associated with hate groups""; who those hate groups are; and what Kurtz et al. have done to warrant the accusation of racism.  Otherwise, your charge of racism is odious . . . racism being one of the worst things a person can be (IMHO)."

""The SJC ruling also cited the Boston Police Department's own analysis, which found blacks were 8 percent more likely to be stopped repeatedly and 12 percent more likely to be searched and frisked even when controlling for factors like criminal history, gang affiliation and violent crime areas.""  http://www.wbur.org/news/2016/09/20/mass-high-court-black-men-may-have-legitimate-reason-to-flee-police"
Why does it bother you so much? Could it be because....most of the players doing the kneeling are black?
"black lawmakers make partisan political rants based on ignorance since sessions has been a fighter who not only prosecuted the KKK racist, but convicted and sued for 8 million bankrupting them, he also saw the confiction of a racist murderer who was executed etc,, time for the dems to realize they were soundly defeated across america and get with the program."
"DeVos said that historically black colleges and universities are “real pioneers when it comes to school choice.” That's like saying that baseball's Negro Leagues were real pioneers of affirmative action. Her statement isn't merely tone deaf; it's a perfect example of what George H.W. Bush meant when he coined the term ""the soft bigotry of low expectations."""
"Black Lives Matter is comprised of the intellectually lazy.... content to yell from their bullhorns that a problem exists, but wanting no part in the solution lest they be held accountable for its results....the intellectual equivalent of the guy who points out in the woods that you're lost yet who offers no plan to ease the way back to camp."
"When cops kill the ""mentally ill"" and cops kill African-Americans that's called justified self-defense. But when Nazis demonstrate and blow off a lot of hot air that's called hate. Let's face it - those tagged ""mentally ill"" are one of society's most hated scapegoats, along with the homeless, addicts, the indigenous, and the poor in general.
  The difference between Nazis hatred of blacks and Jews and society's hatred of the ""mentally ill""? One is sanctioned by society, the other is merely a lot of blustering hot air that society exploits to scare people."

"A year after Mary Spilde succeeded Dr. Moskus, her approval among all staff groups was gone. Her precipitating actions included: 1. Hiring a head of HR whose previous professional experience consisted of being a principal & HR staff (https://www.linkedin.com/in/dennis-carr-1ba0a29 & http://www.slane.k12.or.us/).  LCC staff kept approaching me about the process. E.g. a South Lane School District Board member & LCC staffer asked me if I knew why it was taking a month for Carr's references to be completed, 2.  Hiring, not the # 1 candidate--an African American man--not the # 2 candidate--an Asian American woman--but the # 3 candidate--an African American  woman as the Vice President for Instruction & Student Services. Parenthetically, she lasted less than 3 years on the job etc.  Dr. Hamilton must be provided explicit performance guidance & consequences based management.  Shame on LCC's Board and us a community if, as expected given it's current governance profile, it does 1 iota less."

"Pandora: Hmmm...walk a mile in the shoes of a woman of color, who experienced blatant racism throughout her Catholic school years by many students while being told herself to be tolerant (weekly). Who sees current discriminatory practices utilized when girls are forbidden to be altar servers and LGBTQ persons denied the dignity to marry in the church. Your own privilege is clearly showing by your response and misses the point of welcoming those who've always felt on the outside. Your response perpetuates fear and disappointment young Catholics face when trying to reach out for community within the walls of the traditional church. Your response lets me know you would not acknowledge my presence if you saw me in church or walking by you. Classic responses such as, ""my parish is different, I'm not privileged/racist/etc... or my all time favorite is - well you misunderstood what I said,"" only invite and create further distancing from the RC church. Listen, be proactive, reach out, Peace."
"Letting them beg is just enabling them to not find a real solution to their problems. The mentally ill, that's a different deal, but the bums? A combination of tough love and low tolerance for harassment and laziness (and lying. They have NO problem lying for money) is needed. It is exactly like feeding squirrels; feed one, and soon you'll be feeding many. Except squirrels don't mind working to improve their situation in life. Every society has people who just don't want to work, no matter what, and many of ours can be found on the 16th Street Mall."
"You over look in your praise of LBJ his obviously true feelings ie; this quote ""These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference. For if we don't move at all, then their allies will line up against us and there'll be no way of stopping them, we'll lose the filibuster and there'll be no way of putting a brake on all sorts of wild legislation. It'll be Reconstruction all over again."""
"I was wondering how long it would take the puckering anuses to use the word shrill...10 seconds in, hmmm. I see electing a woman as a bigger deal than electing a black man, not that wasn't groundbreaking, just different. 161 millions times different. American's have trouble with female leaders, some Americans. We wonder why when the first comment use 'shrill' 'lecture' etc... Oh yeah there's the ""B"" word too although the PC folks have taught us this isn't to be said aloud in polite company...but it's there in Trump and too many mouths. To many men smack too many woman every day because they are thinking human's too!"
"Keep repeating falsehoods to yourself, Thor, and you'll eventually believe them.
Mr. Phillips' main business is making custom-designed wedding cakes. He refused to design a wedding cake for a gay couple solely because they were gay. He wil sell them only generic cakes, not custom-designed ones. They never discussed design. You keep forgetting that fact. Mr. Phillips doesn't refuse to design wedding cakes for straight couples solely because the couples are black or inter-racial or inter-religious.
You seem to labor under the delusion that there is a ""gay wedding cake"" or that gay or lesbian couples want wedding cakes with ""gay themes"". Most gay couples simply want a custom-design cake. Just like a straight couple.
You still want conservative Christian businesses to be able to refuse service to any customer -- as long as the customer is gay or a gay couple."
"Clearly you are a multi-skilled person and can achieve anything that you set your sight on. Well, it is a wild guess - you will be writing an excellent novel soon.

As  a socially colour-blind person,  it is difficult to comprehend significant focus on the natural nature of a person, being proud.  ""And as a person of colour, these are roadblocks at every step along the way."" Well, true. So did  the Irish, Italians, Jewish and, Ukrainians had gone through so that the next generations are ok. Yet primarily Italians mix around with other Italians and not in Irish bar.

"Wow. Just wow.  Black women feel more pain than this pig would ever be able to endure. Take it down. (And the speculum is an instrument of torture in the hands of most doctors, particularly the males.) They also say certain parts feel no pain. To this day. Surprise, man beasts!"
"The 3,000 ""pastors"" who sent letters to Congress are primarily non-Churchmen, meaning homosexual ""pastors"" and Muhammudanists: look at them in the article picture.  
Many have fuchsia fever, wearing the reserved color of bona fide bishops in the Historic Church.  
Noteworthy is the bearded mullah with a uniform to emulate that of the somber  Episcopalian (or Methodist) in the full Anglican collar (sporting a gay stole).  
Remarkable also is the Afro hairstyle behind with cross earrings.  The cross is not meant as an object of adornment, jewelry, particularly in presumably a woman's ear.
So: this display is all about costumes, and not about Jesus.
If the pastors were all about curing souls, they would encourage illegal immigrants to comply with the law of the land and become legal immigrants. Too bad the Bishop of Rome aligns the RCC with these miscreant ""clergy"", proof that social action issues are not what the Historic Church is all about, but, rather regular, valid Holy Communion."
"One reason is  fear and anger from people who see Civil and Human Rights as some kind of finite good like a pie. They're afraid that if someone else gets some, they'll somehow get less. Which of course makes  no sense at all. 

 Another problem is the misinterpretation of the Bible by generations of Christians and a mule-headed unwillingness to rethink anything based upon modern science. For example, Blacks were considered inferior and worthy of slavery for centuries based on Genesis 9:20-27 where Canaan  and all his descendants were cursed to be slaves because of the mistake of Canaan's father, Ham, at seeing his father's nakedness. Of course we now know that this wasn't directed at blacks, (Canaan's skin color isn't even mentioned!) but as a justification for the Israelite invasion of the land of the Canaanites.

In the same way, Biblical texts about male on male sex in the Bible are misinterpreted as modern Biblical studies and science prove yet many refuse to see that."
"Come on Ken,  the very same rantings in that letter are almost word for word of the things you've been heard saying for years.

"""Virtually no minorities voted for Trump.""  Absolutely true.

Only 12% of black folks even bothered to vote.  Only 11% of Hispanics even bothered to vote.

88% of black folks voted for Hillary.  80% of Hispanics voted for Hillary.  

The black folks and the Hispanics stayed home and therefore have nothing to complain about if they don't like the result of the election they boycotted."
"The only thing these protesters are to do is hurt the NFL and the NFL fans. The NFL is going to lose viewers and merchandise sales while the NFL supporters are going to lost a relaxing national past time because some spoiled racists decided to disrespect the flag and the country it stands for. By supporting these radical racists the NFL has made a serious business blunder, but they are the ones who will have to live with it. 
As for protesters nothing will come for their actions because their demands are for other to change while they continue to do the same. The same 70% of black births to single moms, the same black on black murders, the same gangsta attitude and the victim mentality indoctrination."
Ans because it's important to keep track of the Black lives matter crew crime wave.
"Oh I don't know.  Muslims are very afraid of us.  Illegals are afraid.  African Americans and mostly young children are being basically murdered all over this country.  It all started w/Trayvon.  If, as a woman, a car pulled over and two men jumped out.........started running at me aggressively..........w/o hesitation, I'd run.  Then they did it again: got out of the car and ran towards him.  I think he had every reason in the world to fear for his safety.  I'm certainly not proud of those stats at the end of the story.  Damn.  l2g"
"No internet or shared public information on criminal backgrounds, but vocation directors in the 1980's did ask probing questions about personal history, faith formation, sacraments, church attendance, family, schooling, sexual history, dating, employment etc. during the interview process.  These also came up during the course of hours and hours of spiritual direction in seminary.  If he simply chose to withhold this information from those charged with his admission to seminary and formation, there is a problem because those who called him to holy orders were grossly deceived. To put it another way, his past might well have proven to be an insurmountable impediment to ordination which raises the question: Did his ordaining bishop know about his past and elect to ordain him anyway?"

"No just Obama. How about Clinton and Monica Lewinsky?! 
Every president has its own dirty laundry that they use their political and presidential power to cover up or minimize any situation they perfer didn't happen. Kennedy's protected a rapist & a murderer .... the list goes on .... All the way back when Abe Lincoln had an affair and children with a black slave ...... So I'm not sure if the anti Obama comments are because he is black or if you just hate Obama ... The Busch administration led us into war for WWMD that no one seemed to find. Then there is Nixon .... Can't really think of any President that DIDN'T have something to hide and used government resources for damage control - can you?"
"Criminal laws do not go against human nature, they simply follow natural law, entities that/who violate the societal acceptable standards are punished. The only real societal changes take place at the kitchen table, and the more the government tries to force the issue the worse it gets.
So what you are suggesting with all of these news laws is the blacks can't be trusted to make it on their own without the assistance of central government? This is my question because I know many successful elderly black individuals, being elderly myself, it is the age group I associate with."
"Your fixation on Black Lives Matter is really bizarre - mostly because the group is so very small.  Is there something about that group that has you riled up?  Oh, wait ...

Groups can drown out others because they can.  The Constitution gives the much, much larger group the same right to protest."
"There is a perception that black individuals are being shot without reason. While I am not convinced there is a systemic problem I have seen numerous videos where black men are shot to death and clearly should not have been. That is what the protest and the BLM movement are addressing. 

Regardless of color, lipping off to a cop, refusing to cooperate, being pulled over should not be ""rolling the dice"". If a police officer does something offensive I should not be shot to death for saying so. 

In the cases above, some the people killed were in complete compliance with the law and the demands of the officer and were still shot dead. NONE of them (in the videos I saw) were in any way threatening the life of the cop or anyone else."
"Sorry, but I don't believe you. First, you contradict yourself throughout the story. Second, the word - miscegenation - wasn't in anyone's lexicon back then, with your grandmother. You inserted that word for your own emphasis. 
Lastly, you never researched history. Lee never owned slaves. He was a Union officer who switched solely for the purpose of defending Virginia, which at the time had 60,000 free blacks, the highest amount of any state.

"My, my let us see who is a racist.  Darren,   

You say: "" Obviously, not everyone who voted for Donald Trump was motivated by racial hatred""

I rejected the other option.... I didn't want a  pair of career criminals in the oval office - one as President with her husband as an illegal Shadow President.   Gender had nothing to with it.  In Obama's case, I vetted him and I found that his Marxist background and dedication to Marcusian repressive tolerance  and the tactics of Saul Alinksy made unacceptable for any public office.

You say:  ""President Trump being surrounded by a handful of black people that had worked on his campaign, who dutifully applauded""

Ahhhh.. very revealing about you Darren.  This means  Black person who strays from the Democrat plantation gets called  or is inferred to be an ""Uncle Tom"" .

MLK's bust was always there.  President Trump replaced the bust of Winston Churchill as well, that Obama as the  grandson of a Mau Mau terrorist  removed  his first day office."
"Keep going---and your solution is---to go out and get all the guns .  That's what democrats really want . Do you really think American's would give up their guns ?  They want us to be like England where you can't even own a B B gun.  Alaska probably has more guns per household than any other state.  So why , with it's strict gun laws--is Chicago the worst city in America ? Or a bigger question---why do democrats scream about controlling guns when a mass murder happens yet when dozens are killed every week by blacks against other blacks in Chicago they don't utter a word ?  Democrats jump to blame the NRA yet say nothing about the blacks doing all the killing in Chicago. Why don't those black lives matter to democrats , Black Lives Matters ,  Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson , Obama or the national media . Those deaths in Chicago amount to more than all the mass shootings put together in six months.  Last---what's your solution to ending mass shootings other than offering meaningless stats ?"
"I fear that he and many bishops think that once the abuse stops....""

But which church will be affected by this breach? The European Church? The Latin American? The African? The Asian? What part of Europe? Which segment? What dioceses in the US? Which segment of the US church? I think the receptivity/degree of receptivity of these different churches/regions/dioceses/ cultures/constituencies of the church (to the clergy abuse crisis) will differ as their solutions or ""solution-ism"" will differ. The crisis has less weight (or more) in some countries than in others. Then you have the polity, as it were, of the CC incarnated in national conferences of bishops, dioceses, canon law, the Holy See, individual bishops (almost 6,000 of them), etc. In all this, it is hard to ascribe one particular view or position or solution to Francis, especially as he looks at the church through the prism of the church's shortcomings and leadership failures. I pray for him and just focus on the US church."

"""paid leftist thugs… should stomp those cockroaches too.. no?""

"A brief slap on the wrist.  Hilariously, police administrators said that other than hiring a hooker, his record was spotless, and so he'll be back on the force.

Yeah, spotless except for lying through his teeth, up and down, with a straight face while looking them straight in the eye.  Repeatedly.

I'm sure, like so many readers of the Denver Post this morning, I just have no idea whatsoever what it is those ""Black Lives Matter"" troublemakers are making a fuss about!"
Racism does not have a degree.  Is he 5% racist or 25%? Maybe he's 62% racist.  He likes black people but not their hearts. What degree would that be?
It sadly shows who is out there blogging when a comment that does not meet civility standards gets more positive votes than a comment that opposes racism against blacks. This leads us to why action needs to be taken to oppose racism and religious bigotry. We cannot let those who would promote racism against blacks and hatred towards Muslims to get away with it. These and anti-semitism are the current focal points of bigotry in our society. The bigots will forever try to argue that we must only talk in generalities because they will never specifically oppose bigotry to the specific groups that they dislike.

"Good cite Martha. This is exactly how the ""news"" media has been playing the unaware public.

GDP hit 3.0 last quarter. The Stock Market is at an all time high! Unemployment is lower. And, as far as the ""racist"" claim goes, Black employment is way up under Trump. Inflation has stayed low. Foreign countries may not like him, but they do respect him, because they know he will do as he says."
"Yes, agree about Jews. 
This was strictly a snarky moment about labeling senators by ""color,"" and was meant to point out the fuzziness of thought when it comes to ethnic affiliations and demarcations. At some point it becomes inaccurate (and perhaps inflammatory) to participate in painting Hirono by the numbers as Asian, therefore ""of color,"" while the ""Asian"" Schatz is not."

"Thats not what I suggested at all and im not really sure where any of what you said came from.  Again, the issue is that Trumps stance encapsulates ALL trans people.  If someone is just post-op and is still going through a lot of medical issues - I can totally understand why they should not be accepted at that time...just as I would expect an otherwise healthy individual who just broke their leg to not be accepted until they are back to being 100% again.   

But to deny a trans person who has been post-op for years and is no longer needing medical procedures done or anything like that - thats just wrong.  If they are physically capable of meeting the minimum standards for joining the military, then they should be allowed to join.  Trumps policy statement suggests that he does not care what the health is of the trans person is in any way; just that the simple fact they are trans, is a disqualifier.  Kind of like how being black, or a woman, or gay used to be."
"Here's Drumpfster's thinly transparently coded, vast left wing conspiracy/Black Lives Matter, remark:

– He told this Pennsylvania crowd to get a group of friends together on Election Day, vote and then go to ""certain areas"" and ""watch"" the voters there. ""I hear too many bad stories, and we can't lose an election because of you know what I'm talking about.""

He was speaking of course to his loyal xenophobes and referring to the two wankers who play ""New Black Panther Party"" dressup, standing outside a Philadelphia polling place, every four years. The media shows up for this goofy duo like it does annually for Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, PA.

The truth is, those lames have never changed anyone's vote. It's a 99% black precinct where The Donald is polling at zero-point-zero. But when he gets hammered, he can claim the election was ""stolen."""
"Do you realize over 200 million American gun owners last night hurt no one with their guns ?  No gun law is going to stop nut jobs from getting guns .  How on earth do you think it will ?  Then , what if someone passed 20 background checks and passed every one of them with flying colors  . Does that mean with 100 percent certainty that something might never happen in their life where they go crazy ?  This is what democrats do after every tragedy--they offer a knee jerk reaction that will do nothing to stop these mass murders . look no farther than Chicago with it's nation leading strict gun laws . Every single week blacks slaughter other blacks , year in , year out---by the hundreds  .  Why doesn't Obama , Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson , Black Lives Matters or the national media care about those shootings and deaths given all the innocent people killed in the crossfire ?  And , how would even more gun control stop them ?  Then there's the kid who took his mom's guns . No law stopped that"

"RELIGION, POLITICS AND… HUMAN NATURE
Politics may be a factor in the support and legislation of Bill 62 in Quebec, but it is, obviously, an intervening variable in this equation.  The independent variable is human nature – the great majority of the citizens of Quebec, who feel uneasy, uncomfortable and… probably fearful, when faced with a number of fellow humans covered, from… head to toe, by black garments.  The miniscule number of these… strange shadows is immaterial – the psychological ghosts do not need to be numerous to terrorise some people.  We should also keep in mind that the Quebecois have just managed to free themselves from the fangs of the Catholic Church.  Thus, asking them now to make peace with other religions, we may be asking them for… too much.  Thank you.  A. C."

Ordinary black people can march without being provided with or food. What they  do not tolerate is people who come to them only wen they need votes or support for something.

"Arinze, being African, brings to mind an idea for a film that I have toyed with. Chris Rock has shared some of his comedy acts on you tube. His, "" Take no Prisoners "", approach to social commentary would give an interesting flavor to a retelling of the story of Adam and Eve. Contrasting that Myth, introduced rather rudely to the African population, with more organic Creation Tales from the Dark Continent, could be enlightening and enjoyable. I was surprised at the number of articles that address the prospect of a Black Adam amd Eve to be found on Google. I can see one of my Primordial Brothers attempting to ""Spark"" one of the tribal Chieftan's daughters or wives and having communitarian priveleges revoked. A , "" Sex is Nasty ""  belief might find its' Genesis radically reenforced by such a banishment. If Chris balks at casting himself as Protagonist, he may settle for the Serpentine Antagonist. His portrayal of particularly strong Feminine partners solidify Eve as very interesting."

"We know very little about what Trump will actually do. What we do know is that he likes to incite people and this message struck a cord with the electorate.

Obviously his conduct is worth protesting and no doubt some players, coaches, etc are supporting their colleagues precisely because of Trump's inappropriate words and position. But at the heart of it this is about the treatment of blacks in America. Something Trump isn't addressing despite how it's starting him in the face. It's further evidence actually of how uninformed and out of touch he is with his own country.

Trump may be delivering the kind of bombast and empty rhetoric that his supporters expect and feed on but it's a far cry from how a President should be conducting himself. And the irony of you trying to call out others for lying is rich indeed when Trump's record of lies is so easily apparent. And you call others hypocrites. Unbelievable."
"I am not suggesting that murder of anyone by anyone ought to be discounted.  BLM was formed in reaction to the disproportionate rates at which police officers shoot black men.  That is the issue that they are addressing.
I believe that the murder rate would be lowered if we spent more money on education to improve inner city schools, if we did a better job enforcing gun laws, if we offered more support for families in need, if  we had better after school programs, if we did a better job preventing teen pregnancies ....
It's not at all fair to suggest that BLM people don't care about black murder victims.  No one organization can address all of society's evils and shortcomings."

Of course, Melania was Slovenian, and her name comes from the Greek μελαινα, which means black, or to the medically inclined (as 'melaena'), 'black stool resulting from an upper GI bleed'.  So if Trump were a racist, would he marry someone whose name means 'black'?  That's civil marriage, of course, because it was his third. 
Anyway, getting back to football, this afternoon I watched the local second XV take on Tunbridge Wells.  None of this ridiculous overspecialisation of American football--offence, defence, special teams--and no Darth Vader suits either.  Just a bunch of sweaty men jumping on top of each other.  Building a bridge, as it were.  And mercifully free of kneeling controversies."
"I don't know what 'black privilege' means, but George Soros record is clear for this election year.

His son also donated $1 million three days ago through the Planned Parenthood PAC for Hillary.  (That tax free corporation has put $20 million toward her campaign, of course.)"

"Trump is not fit for the Presidency.  Nor is Clinton.  But your posing an equivalency between Trump and Clinton on actual ""life"" is glib.  Hillary has supported partial birth abortion.  Now, let's grant this much:  Catholics can't really expect everyone not schooled in Catholic thinking to believe in ensoulment from the moment of conception.   Got that.  STILL, who in his right mind believes that killing a child just a few days short of birth is different from killing a born-alive baby?  Yet, this is what Clinton supports.  And she will appoint a Supreme Court who sees it her way.  Granting that Trump would be the worst President ever --- and I do believe he would be --- how could we justify electing Clinton?   We would be horrified if asked to vote for a President who would authorize the enslavement of, say, 3,000 black people.  Such a person should never be elected, no matter what else.  How, then, could we vote for Clinton, given her stance on partial birth abortion?"

"An elephant is not mentioned in the article.

Mainstream media has failed (hello CBC, Toronto Star, Globe and Mail) to assure viewers they are receiving reporting that aspires to be balanced and objective.

Look, no kidding, when viewers realize, from everyday observations, the big media outlets are not giving straight goods, they will naturally seek alternative (often dubious) information sources. 

Examples of media bias?

1. Selectively reporting protests. I favour liberal abortion access for Canada, but city drivers know anti-abortion activists hold periodic protests. The media ignore them - yet activists from Black Lives Matter (and various minority/gender groups) get covered all the time. Why so SELECTIVE?

2. The South China Morning Post investigating, YEARS before ANY Canadian journalists, the connection between Vancouver house prices and overseas money.

3. CENSORING away race/ethnicity identities with crime, EMPHASIZING them when good works are done.

Other examples, anyone?"

"This article is very helpful in outlining and shedding light on the current state of governance in South Africa. There are 3 main points that I take away that I believe are useful for the broader citizenry: (1) Not about personalities, but structural. Cancer is such a useful metaphor, as explained. If we as citizens think this is about a few naughty individuals, we will wake up too late. (2)  There's opportunity to shift the discourse from ""black"" to actual social groupings that are the lived expression of frustration in South Africa: the poor, the middle class, the workers, the welfare dependent, etc. This suggests that the term ""black"" masks actual struggles of black people, and thus the term is made cheap, and useless to me as a black South African. (3) The role of ""big"" capital. Perhaps there's a way to deal with this structural problem other than a route that risks total annihilation of the whole economy to the detriment of the whole society. This point needs further thought."

I bet money the Deputy was polite and courteous...No evidence the Deputy even knows the driver is an African American prior to the stop!

I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

Once they can breath they are called takers by the likes of Trump voters and conservatives in general. BTW, I've spent more than 60 years being black.

If Democrats are ""beholden"" to gay rights groups they are equally ""beholden"" to groups that support women's rights, children's rights, black people's right, workers' rights, poor people's rights, and individual rights against wealthy corporate interests - in short, Democrats care about the little guy and those who are downtrodden, i.e. the very people Republicans have forgotten.

"Re: ""For me, its easy to dislike Trump because he is a Christian""

I see no evidence that he IS Christian. 

He bears constant false witness. He has committed adultery numerous times (and quite publicly). He covets ... a LOT. He mocks Christian sacraments (and the Pope). He rejects Christ's message to ""sell all that you have and give it to the poor"". (  I sincerely doubt he tithes.) He rejects the Christian concept that all are worthy. He mocks the disabled and doesn't seem inclined to help 'heal' any maladies. (Quite the opposite, it seems.) The only way he's ""honoured [his] father] was to emulate his discriminatory business practices by trying to deny rental accommodations to blacks. He rejects Christ's notion that ""the servant is worthy of his hire"" by stiffing his contractors. He in no way ""love[s his] enemies - quite the contrary.

Here's the full context:
The president met for nearly two hours with leaders of eight law enforcement groups Monday, informing them that he considered the killing of the five police officers in Dallas on Thursday “a hate crime” and that he would work actively to serve as an intermediary between minority activists and police.

“I’m your best hope,” Obama remarked at one point, according to the Fraternal Order of Police’s James O. Pasco, one of the meeting’s attendees.

“I don’t disagree,” said Pasco, who has criticized aspects of the administration’s gun-control policy. “We’re all in this together.”

Intermittent, unexpected violence in Europe, in places where I might actually travel, is both shocking and relevant to me for good reason. The fact that I pay more attention doesn't mean I dismiss the value of brown or black lives."
"""...all three religions have traversed periods of extremism, such as the Spanish Inquisition (Christianity) and, more recently, the fanatic Jewish settlers in Israel’s Occupied Territories whose religious claims to the land eschew the rights of others."" That seems a little harsh on the Jews of Israel. Are you seriously comparing a virtual genocide in Spain to fighting terrorism in Israel? Jews in Israel who commit crimes face a court. The Inquisition was the court. The population of Muslims in Israel has steadily increased. The population of Jews in Spain was wiped out with the exception of the conversos. Israeli Arabs, Muslim or Christian, are free to hold jobs, buy land, vote, go to court all the rights of a Jewish Israeli or any other Israeli citizen. Jews are not permitted to walk or drive in some Arab cities of the ""West Bank"". They are not permitted to buy land in Hebron. Whose rights are eschewed? I don't think it's the ""fanatic Jewish settlers""."
The only one who needs to fix his relationship with black America is Obama.  Blacks have little or nothing to show for progress and improvement during Obama's years as President.
"That was the worst broadcast I have seen/heard in all my years of watching the NFL.  The audio was atrocious.  I mean, it could have been a library they were calling the game from.  I could barely hear the audio, period.  Nothing against the female announcer who does a better job with baseball - - but the monotone voices and lack of energy - - you would have been better off listening to KOA if you could sync the audio to the video.  Unacceptable and a real black eye on ESPN, IMHO."
"Charles, what have the lib boys ever done for black folks?  I think you should seriously rethink the liberal path.  Liberals are not for equality.  They are very happy to keep minorities poor and dependent.  Think hard on it.  There are things we Americans could do to stimulate growth and self-development of all Americans.  The libbers do not support those actions."
"Wayne was an honor student. He credits a strong academic work ethic for his success.  His word play is genius. He's also a skateboarder and black, soooo he gets his hate..."
"I disagree that the coach's message was ""we are all the same"". The coaches message was ""There's us and them -- why are you afraid of them? Here's some of them. Touch some of them. See, don't be afraid of them."" It's a sick, clueless, offensive mentality. 

Also, you cannot tell us WHY the other parent declined to be interviewed. Sure, in wealthy communities there are lots of parents trying to manipulate the coaches. But also a black family will often try to keep their name out of the news on a complaint because their child still has to attend school and be in the social milieu where other kids may ostracize them for getting the coach in trouble.  

I hope the school district does the right thing and gets rid of this coach. And uses it as an example for other coaches of how not to invoke race with our young people."
"Her ancestors were forced to go to the West Indies, from India. They went as semi-slaves, and forced to convert to Christianity.

Why is it the only thing you know about India is the caste system? The only time it was legal was under the British Rule. At that point, there was apartheid in India - European only schools, hotels, streets, etc. They didn't mind if there was discrimination among Indians.

As soon as India became independent, caste discrimination was outlawed. Whereas in Hong Kong, Africa, the USA, and other British colonies practiced apartheid for centuries. In Hong Kong, till the 1990s, there were EUropean only schools, neighbourhoods, clubs etc. In the USA, till the 1960s, segregation was legal. Interracial marriage was illegal. And so on."

I don't even remember him coming here when he campaigned the first time. some blacks are soooooooooooooooo.....  never mind

"Michael,

Many perceive that restitution is essential to forgiveness, if not a prerequisite, but that is not the scriptural model. God forgives us because we need to be forgiven so that reconciliation can take place and there is no possible way for us to pay Him restitution for what He suffered because of our sins. Sometimes restitution plays an instructive role and is good, but it is not mandatory and in the current social context the demands by Blacks in America to continue receiving benefits and advantages not enjoyed by the rest of society is increasingly being viewed as an odious offense making reconciliation more difficult. Instead of demanding restitution, what if we just loved people and let God's transforming power change them? Doing that takes restitution out of the picture and builds unity in Him as we become citizens of the Kingdom of God."
"People seeing doctors for legitimate pain control are not the ones dying.
Why is this suddenly an issue?
Because people on pain meds have been cut off by doctors who are afraid of being targeted.
So they turn to the black market for their pain management.
These are the results."
"Sad that these players think that kneeling to protest racism cures black ills.  Racism doesn't explain black-on-black crime, rape, or murder.  More importantly, complaining about it doesn't give people jobs or get them an education.  I just read that Colin Kaepernick has donated $1 million dollars to charity.  This gesture is much appreciated and will make a real difference in people's lives."
And the hits just keep coming ; One winner smokes dope on the trail and gets busted for pot on him at the airport :  dogs are doped up and other's are suspected of doing it : dogs are abused on the trail : dogs die on the trail :  when a long time sponsor decides to spend their ad money someplace else they are attacked like by a pack of rabid dogs ; and prize money is dropping.The pathetic part about the Iditarod is they're code of silence---refusing to name the musher involved in the dog doping . Even worse are the Iditarod supporters----so what they say if a musher is smoking dope and gets busted at the airport--and now--so what if a guy liberates another mushers kennels . So what if charges are filed against the guy . Because he has a big name how dare police charge him. And so what if dogs die year after year after year because mushers use them to win prize money and a new Dodge pickup.  I'd never buy any car or truck or product from a company that sponsors this dog killing race.
"For all those who claim that kneeling is disrespect to flag and country are dead wrong, period. The only disrespect is unarmed people are being killed by those sworn to protect. Since we are referring to Black Americans in these instances, I would have you know that Black Americans fought in every war America has waged. This is fact and here's the first......In 1770, Crispus Attucks, a black man, became the first casualty of the American Revolution when he was shot and killed in what became known as the Boston Massacre. This in a time where Mr. Attucks could not even be counted as a citizen. Look in the mirror and repeat after me, ..... I'm not allowed to be a citizen, but I can die for your tea? The ultimate disrespect!"
"There are very smart Black people who will join people of other races to boycott these jock clowns - without an audience and people buying their promotional stuff, just like the NFL they will no longer be a profit to own or know. Schools will lose donations etc.

"Health Canada, are you a regulator or a patsy?  For a new industry comprising entirely small, entrepreneurial producers, vigilance is more important than ever.  The Canadian public is already sceptical of the new ""for-profit"" medicinal marijuana vs black market product. When one of the newly licensed companies is caught red-handed applying a carcinogenic chemical directly onto the pharmaceutical product, I am baffled that Health Canada has not pulled its license.  The buying public will err to the black market as a result.  This is 100% on the Minister of Health."
"This, like the Bell Curve, ignores the environmental impact on career choice. I scored in the 98th percentile on science achievement tests. No one encouraged me to pursue medical research. It was unheard of because of my race and gender. Never tested, they said I had average or below average intelligence. At the age of 47 years,  I scored as intellectually superior on one test and higher than 705 of the population on the other. These scores were met with displeasure by my career counselor. Empowered I finished my B.S. degree, pursued a career in technical communication. Exclusionary and abusive environments limit academic and career choice.  Blacks pursue careers in sports not because their brains and bodies are hardwired to excel there, but because they are exposed to it in their environment and it is where they see people that look like them succeed.  My premise: women exposed to exclusionary and abusive environments cause changes in the areas of the brain that impact career choice."
"At this point there is a mountain of irrefutable evidence that the Guptas engaged in many thousands of serious criminals acts. The fact that they have not been charged is sickening and perplexing. South African cannot exist as a country of any credibility whatsoever while these scum of the earth vipers walk free.

The fact that Zuma is still President is equally perplexing and sickening.

When you stop and dismiss the unsound symbolism associated with hate groups and see it for what it is, it is quite beautiful. The Stars and Bars connects me with my southern roots and heritage. I feel bad that others have the ugly misconceptions.  But, it is who I am.  I will never forget where I come from.  I am a descendant of Alexander Cleague (Clagg) from TN.  He traveled from PN building homes along the way.  People didn't have $$ to pay, so they paid in slaves. He taught them valuable tradecraft skills.  Many honored him by taking our name.  Many blacks with our name live today in SE TN. Many families suffered during Reconstruction.  I have reason to be bitter as my ancestors suffered from merciless carpetbaggers.  I chose to heal, move forward and forgive."
"I challenge these highly paid black athletics, who are so critical of the United States, to name a country in Africa or elsewhere in the world to which blacks have immigrated where their lives would have been better socially and economically than in the United States of America.

"Read: The Seed is Mine by Charles van Onselen and Sol Plaatje’s Native Life in South Africa. The attitude of the British and Afrikaners, towards Africans, only differs by degrees - the Afrikaners perfected and legislated (i.e. deepened) the harsh racist policies of the Brits. By the way around 10 000 Africans died in that so called Anglo-Boer war that was a skirmish between two invading forces for the spoils of our defeated people. There is a long history between the English and the Afrikaners in this country and a very significant part of that has to do with the differences they had with regard to the ""native problem""."

"You're wasting your time. Hardcore western feminists and hardcore opponents to western feminism are basically two sides of the same irrational coin. You can't really convince either side anything that doesn't conform to their narrow view.

Most reasonable people would agree that, regardless of what's going on in the developed world, women are far from equal in Africa."
While agreeing with your views of past mistreatment it does not mean we should make future generations separate and distinct as citizens.  They are not.  Canada had slavery until the early mid-1800's (and of course the Indians had it for centuries before that) and we all know America had it....why not restitution for black people?  What about the Vietnamese and Japanese and the Jewish citizens that were mistreated?  Do we give women 2x the vote for not getting the right til well after men.      The fact is when you separate and treat people different they are less likely to succeed and that is what is taking place with our beautiful FN peoples.
"Jon Grant is a first-rate council candidate (I don't disagree with one word of the Weekly's description of him) but given the horrendous political climate in which we currently find ourseives, under a president whose open, unfiltered contempt for women and people of color (Latinas/Latinos in particular) is unprecedented in modern political history, I believe there is an obligation to support members of those groups for public office in EVERY instance unless there is a truly compelling ideological reason not to. Mosqueda, like Grant, is solidly progressive, as the Weekly freely admits (as does the Stranger).  Therefore, for me, in this context, she is the clear choice. In the Obama era this race would not have been as easy a call, but those days are sadly over for now. Vote Mosqueda for Position 8."
"Johnny Cash Family Tells Nazis: Don't Wear 'Man In Black' T-Shirts

We were sickened by the association."
"Given Oregon's long history of racism I applaud anyone who works to overcome the lingering effects of that scourge upon our society, and Mark Harris has certainly had an innovative approach. 

 In a February 18th column he instructed his Eugene Weekly readers ""Negro History Week started as an internal Negro Community Celebration, remembering the birthday and the difference between Frederick Douglass (my personal favorite Republican) and Lincoln (my least favorite Republican who edges out Ben Carson and Donald Trump).""
Being an ardent  supporter of both Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln as well as a staunch critic of both Donald Trump and Ben Carson, I found his proposition quite, well, uh, ""interesting.""  

While I don't agree with his Lincoln-Trump comparison, Mr. Harris is correct that there are reasons for, as well as against, a campus BRT.  The key is that it be handled by competent, objective professionals who are sensitive to both  issues of  academic free speech and racism."
"I'm sorry not to see my parish listed. But not surprised, I guess. Our pastor is extremely liberal in his outlook, carefully inclusive in all his remarks, and would, I am confident, be completely welcoming to all.  I think one reason there is not a particularly visible LGBTQ presence in our church is that Black LGBTQ people have a lot of difficulties in the general community, and there is much less broad support for mainstreaming than one finds in more privileged communities. 

There's a Black protestant church not far away, that is, I am told, THE church to belong to, as an LGBTQ person of color. I attended a sad and difficult funeral there, and was moved and impressed by the way the pastor spoke to the conflicted responses of those attending. A woman pastor, with great gifts. If I was queer and Black,  and looking for a community of worship, I imagine I would be drawn there, rather than undertaking missionary work in a Catholic church."
"""No one organization can address all of society's evils and shortcomings.""  

True.  But when blacks are murdered far more often by black civilians than by police, AND the organization that calls itself ""Black Lives Matter"" is virtually silent on the subject of black-on-black murder, I have to doubt the genuineness of the organization.  Reason would tell you that you'd hear BLM address this issue far more vocally and far more often --- if their main concern really were that black lives are being lost to murder."
"Without exactly equal and same ordination practices for men and women there will be no fullness of participation.  We truly lie to ourselves and sin the wrong of hatred while we stand by and watch women being treated as lesser human beings in our church.  Christ never taught that women should be treated differently than men for any reason.  We need to honestly call sexism out for the hatred and abuse that it is.  

If I were to imply that black men could gain fullness of participation without same and equal treatment and ordination - I would be called a racist hater of black people.  My accusers would be correct in their judgement and complaint just as women are just in accusing all of us who are willing to be the example of this sexist hatred in our church by not demanding women be ordained priests immediately.  

Dialogue is useless if the talk is dishonest or contrived against the human dignity of any person."
I think they were hoping it would magically turn them into the college football equivalent of the All Blacks.
"""You are insinuating that he is a “traitor to his race”...""

No. I was stating [a fact] that Mr. Miranda shouldn't declare he is incapable of racism just because he [himself] is a Person of Color. He insists that it's ""not about racism"". But he wants to paint over a tribute mural to a murdered Black teen and replace it with business logos. Mr. Miranda says that he has been subjected to racial profiling his whole life. No doubt; the history of Puerto Ricans dealing with racial violence is long and extensive. That Puerto Rico is basically a stolen U.S. colony to this day testifies to this history.

But Mr. Miranda seems to have a lack of empathy for OTHERS who've also have a lifetime of experiencing systemic racism and violence. And that's not ok."
How about being black? Are you fine with that? Something tells me deep down you are not.
"If your last sentence was actually true, all black-on-black murders would end today, and shooting victims , their relatives and any witnesses would actually come forward and give names and descriptions to law enforcement,  so shooters could be put in jail.

Some African Americans only have themselves to blame for that, the Code Of Silence."

"You do realize that it was LIBERAL leaders that started and continued the war?   That being considered, it is amazing how much respect the left gives a womanizer and the war monger that replaced him.   As far as respecting law enforcement.  I have nothing but respect for the majority.   It is a tough job, not made any easier by many that are complaining.  The people of color get the kind of law enforcement they deserve.  Remember it is a circle they help perpetuate.   Blacks riot and attack cops and others, cops crack down, which brings more rebellion from blacks, which brings further crack downs. and so on.      Do not think the people of color are so innocent in all of this."

"In general , nobody has a right ""not to feel"" anything. The issue is fact, not feelings. Black students have a right not to BE threatened by their fellow students.

Obama put Hawaii on the popolo map.  Get ready Hawaii.  2 killings by black men in 3 days - does this remind anyone of Chicago? 
And of course, race will always be a defense.  Black men don't commit crimes, they are just falsely accused of committing crimes.  So, Hawaii, look to St. Louis, Ferguson, Baltimore,  and Chicago for a glimpse of what is in store for us, unless we stand up for law and order."
"This article is pure bunk.  The democrats work hard every day to make blacks believe republicans will kill their children via the police. Trump only detailed how the country is today under the dems and how he will improve it.  Sorry Pitts, you dems lose the election, you lose foreign policy America bashing and surrendering, you lose teachers union bribes, and you already lost the miners and steelworkers with your cronies sucking at the government teat of overpriced solar/wind power."
The President should not be calling for an execution before the trial has taken place.  Trump is the same guy who called for the execution of the Central Park 5 likely because they were black.  The Central Park 5 were later exonerated by DNA evidence.
BLM needs to make cops the bad guys as their raison d'etre or else they slide away into irrelevance. Cops were happy to take part and enjoy pride . Now they are being demonized. BLM is a racist organizations that does not actually care about black lives-and that is the worst part of all this.
"HR, I’m not going to judge you for getting out; believe me, unlike most of commenters here, I get it.  I will just leave you with some wise words from historian John Hope Franklin, speaking about the American experience but has some relevance here; I think/hope that is where youre headed with your next endeavour.

He said the “Negro scholar should not imagine he could disappear into an ivory tower. ..the choice to “turn his/her back on the world” is not available. The black scholar must fully embrace this tradition of American intellectual life; 'the proper choice for the American Negro scholar is to use his/her history and ingenuity, his/her resources and talents, to combat the forces that isolate him/her and his/her people and, like the true patriot that s/he is, to contribute to the solution of the problems that all Americans face in common.”

"CONTINUED from ABOVE:

I refer of course to the American Eugenics Movement, which inspired Hitler and which argued that certain ""lineages"" should be forcibly sterilized or otherwise eliminated, to ""improve"" humans by culling ""inferiors"".  Who decides what's inferior?  That has literally proved to be a life or death question.

Regarding your last question as to my ""deciding"" to be heterosexual, that isn't the RIGHT question if you would understand the logical fallacy of claiming certain behaviors ""inborn"" without evidence.  It is as inaccurate a comparison as trying to equate ""gay"" and ""interracial"" marriages in this context.

I'll use myself as an example why the comparison can't be used to claim choice-of-mate is ""inborn"", i.e. controlled by genetics.  I'm mixed European and Arab.  I've had three wives.  Two are black.  One is half-Thai and half Texan.  So am I ""genetically wired"" to marry black women?  Or Thai women?  Or (God forbid) Texas women?  What's your answer?  I'll wait."
"I would point out that the Civil War was about many things: slavery, states' rights, the ongoing economic issues involved in an idustrial North and an agarian South and, of course, the question of secession if a State or States were extremely dissatisfied with being part of the U.S.  I think all of those issues were involved and need to be studied.

The ""major questions"" about evolution.....Simple, it doesn't fit with the conservative Christians' literal interpretation of the Bible.  Those ""major questions"" have nothing to do with the extensive evidence supporting evolution, but are a result of the cognitive dissonance that evidence creates for the ""faithful,"" and, of course, given a choice between denying all that evidence and questioning beliefs you faithfully follow, many conservative Christians have chosen to deny evolution.

It's fine that you ""ended up"" a conservative.  It is also evidence that those schools in the Seattle/Olympia area support free thinking."

However, in today's very divisive climate, the action of wearing of ""blackface"" is likely to cause problems for everyone involved as it will be far more likely seen as a ""mocking"" action than an ""honoring"" action.  Unfortunately, it is also far more likely that it will be a ""mocking"" behavior rather than an ""honoring"" behavior.  I think Ms Shurtz's case is clearly the exception....."

Your response obfuscates vis-a-vis  CC's points.  Yes, Cdn citizens/residents are refused entry for various reasons, likewise Americans at Cdn borders.  The FACT is rejection rates have risen and what is different is increased interrogations, fingerprinting, photographing, detention, inexplicable, unreasonable, reasons for rejections (e.g., 62 yr old Bill McLevin); the deliberate singling out of brown people whether they are Cdn born (telling one such brown woman she needed a visa) or not; questioning Muslim individuals about their religion and opinions about 45.  Maybe GG is looking at the experience of the teenage hockey player who had to be left at the border b/c he wasnt allowed to cross with his team.  BTW, border guard union was one of the few to endorse 45."
"What's wrong with American Heritage Girls?  What's wrong with sponsoring an organization that provides faith based scouting, instead of the secular option, since it is the Church doing the sponsoring after all?

And we do ""recognize and understand the world in which we live."" Which is why we seek to not participate in things that go against what we believe in as Catholics, as our forbears refused burning the grain of incense to the emperor. I can imagine the NCR of that day, it's just a grain of incense, go along to get along, the secular world is not all that bad!"
"I find it interesting that when a vote comes up to be a state they always reject it. Since they are bankrupt and now need help, they are spouting their citizenship. Don't get me wrong they are in a terrible situation and need help desperately. This is similar to the black people of this country. They pick their leadership poorly. It is almost like a dictatorship there."

"You like liberals, so if blacks, however well educated and qualified, espouse anything other than liberal dogma, they're automatically ""tokens"" being trotted out ""for show?""

Nice flaming, yourself, Peter."
"If we want a more civil country, we must decide that all lives matter. I'm not sure that a majority of Americans believe that all lives matter. As a nation, we have never acted like all lives matter. The country has been built on violence both here and abroad. There was no golden age when civility for everyone ruled. Since I'm black, I can testify that civility has never been available to everyone in this country. Remember how Obama was treated. He experienced 8 years of incivility directed at him. So we elected the leader of the birther movement. There was nothing civil about that chain of events. If your only tool is a hammer, all your problems look like nails. The one tool everyone has easy access to is a gun. I don't think that is making us more civil. At the very least, we need more tools in our tool boxes."
The kind souls at Estcourt are racists - they only ate black people!
"''This horrible event demonstrates just how overheated our political rhetoric has become, and how little it may take to set off some disturbed individuals to commit violence. In America, no one should have their life threatened because of their political beliefs and their relationship with others shouldn’t be based on whether their political party wins or loses an election. That’s the way they do it in some Third World countries, not here.''
huh, some right winger seems to have conveniently forgotten the solemn promises of the vast array of trump-loving hate mobs and lone loons to kill Hillary if she won, or the many vestiges of a lynched Obama seen nation wide, or punks for trump punching out innocent blacks and women. gee, how oddly hypocritical, or more correctly, how typical."
"ROTFL.  So there are no black gay people then? Like there are no black feminists?   Gaad, where exactly is that world you live in?"
"Character assassination, sort of like Juanita Broaderick? Race relations, like the terrorist group Black Lives Matter, which is solely responsible for killing police officers? And how many dead people vote Democratic these days?

Policy discussions with facts, like the southern border crossing, illegal immigrants killing and raping their way across the country, like welfare programs decimating the inner cities?

I'm thinking you are engaging in a bit of projection here."
Black tennis player... The country recognizes her more than Hirono...
"Yes Trump is a sleez who should shower at least three times an hour.  And yes Bill Clinton may be in the same boat, although I can't see him making the same nauseating comments about Chelsea.  What I find interesting is this may be what finely takes him down.  Not his comments about black people, and Mexicans, and Muslims, and people with disabilities.  Or his obvious admiration for Putin.  Or his support of nuclear proliferation in Japan and Korea.  Or his complete misunderstanding of the Constitution and subsequent support of ""stop and frisk.""  Maybe, just maybe the American public is finally waking up."
"The so-called Russian Federation covers 1/6th of the world's land area, meaning a person under threat has the option of an  Internal Flight Alternative (i.e. move away from where you are not safe to some place where you can be). So a gay man in the Caucasus can relocate, for example, to, let's say, Moscow, where there is an active gay community that does not suffer persecution (although some of its members likely have been discriminated against, which is not the same thing). Surely under the benevolent leadership-in-perpetuity of Mr Putin LGBTQ folks in Mother Russia  are safe?"
So let me get this straight ... You can't put happenings of the old world at the new world's standards ... so therefore we should praise the Old South for their  enslavement of the Africans b/c it helped to build the New South that we live in today? We should celebrate Hitler b/c he helped reshape Germany? I'm just not getting this here. Also where exactly did this author get their facts? From the Spanish Catholic library?
"Unless you are a black man whose father and his father and his father etc. were beat down (often litterally) you could have no possible idea the ""reallity"" that many feel they face.
It is unfortunate that there is that much hate (racial, class, police) and that guns are so easy to aquire. Combine the two and you have modern America today."
"Isn't this the old hag who said all women who don't vote for Hillary with go to hell?

Like all tired Communist oligarchs she is far past her due date and is like an old rotten piece of cheese on the shelf.

Can't be eaten but to stinky to throw out cause no one will go near it

She doesn't even know the Brandenburg gate fell so long ago.
Sleeping in till noon at her dacha by the lake she assumed the Communist Party finally took over cause some black guy was President.....

Hillary was a shoe-in cause who would dare defy the Goddess!! 

Then of course all those deadbeat billions which now are wasted on 50% of the Canadian and US population that won't work but suck at the throat of the taxpayer cry that she is s goddess....

Speak oh powerful goddess!!! What can we do!

Then Trump happened, the economy is booming, Marxist rabble planted in government are being fired left and right, Jobs, Jobs, Jobs, everywhere

and her entire life flashed before her. 
Sanity slipped away....."
"The number of cases where an exemption has been lost is miniscule. One reason is that the IRS does not want to have the Johnson Amendment tested in the Supreme Court. Black churches endorse candidates all the time.

If Reverend Bob says ""If you vote for A, you will go to hell"", he is 100% protected by the First Amendment. Unlike our Commonwealth cousins, the government may not restrict such a religious judgment delivered in the course of exercising religious rights.

Fortunately for Catholics this rarely happens, and in fact I have been unable to substantiate one case of it occurring in the last election."
"Okay. Now where's your article on the leaked DNC memo for how to ""handle"" questions from black activists?"
You make good points Ms. Moore.   What needs to be pointed out is that free speech does not extend to private employers which the NFL certainly is. Free speech protection extends to individuals and government employees not to someone on the job such as the NFL or any other person in private employment. The NFL could put a stop to the actions of Kaepernick. Of course they won't because he is Muslim and black and any action would not be politically correct.
"Blacks have been banned throughout history from many organizations including politics, military, police on the last century.

You know nothing about the goals of the Evergreen demonstration, a one day event.   Yet you put up a childish whine and compare one day to a lifetime of facing racial bias.    

I won't attempt to respond past this one Bill.  We just have very different perspectives"
"Yes, RadirD, cause all ""disruptive angry activists"" are black right? Other ""disruptive angry activists"" may be ""some nice people"". You're part of the problem and you don't even know it, or choose not to want to know."
"The crazy variants of conservative support were always there--it's just that Harper knew he had to gag them to get a majority. So he did. But they've been itching for release.

Their angel of deliverance, Trump, has risen. They want the same revolution here now: the necons with no sense of citizenry and world; the Christian right who are anti-gay, anti-choice, anti-other faiths; the general old stock folk who think that being told they can't be anti-brown or anti-gay or mindlessly anti-immigrant is ""oppressive political correctness""; and the generally uneducated who fall for every false Facebook post they see that get 'em good and angry.

But this is Canada, not the U.S. Their rise and their Trump clone candidate will spend years in the political wilderness until another Harper comes and hushes them. Actually O'Leary won;t stick around that long. He'll lose then go back to his businesses. Pull a Belinda Stronach basically."

"So I'd anticipate there are also statues of loyalists (Tories in ""American"") in Richmond, to celebrate the defeated past?  No, I thought not.

This noble Southern resistance is another Big Lie of US history, just as Germany wallowed in the ""stab in the back"" to wish away their defeated field army after WWI. 

The confederate soldiers toiled and died so that blacks would not have the same rights they enjoyed. It was the plantation/slave owners who manipulated them to their pathetic deaths."
"Agree about Desmond...Right now, I don't feel good with him anywhere in the lineup...as bad as this sounds, I'd prefer Story instead. Thast's saying something lol.

Black seems to be managing alot differently since the rosters expanded and not in a good way...he seems to be over managing instead of letting guys do their job. Perfect example was last Sunday...pulling Neschek with 2 outs...why?"
"Judging by the march in San Diego, it looked like the same audience that shows up to the usual feminist/LBGQT/black lives matter protests.  If you want to be taken seriously, probably best advisable to not wear a vagina costume."
"Something hilariously hypocritical is going on, which basically unmasks the fact that this is not about patriotism, but about racism - through the conflation of partriotism and opposition to protests over racial injustice.

So, players have kneeled, players have remained in the lockeroom.  Owners have shown up on the field to lock arms with their players.

And while this is going on, WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PERFORMED, the yahoos in the stands are yelling at the players to stand up.  WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS BEING PERFORMED.

- Not standing deferentially.

- Not standing and paying attention to the glory of the flag and anthem.

-Yelling orders at black men below them.

. . . maybe they think that conduct IS what patriotism is all about??"
"For DECADES we had been making progress with our 'treatment' of blacks in America. I travel a lot and don't live in a fantasy world like some. Since Obama was elected ""because we needed to show the world we could elect a black individual"" his RACE BAITING tactics have done everything possible to shred the progress we had made. We have lost decades of hard work and understanding due to ONE MAN AND HIS ACTIONS! YET we still hear people sing his praise, though not so many blacks today... 

Hillary would have continued his destructive path while wearing her MASK of tolerance and understanding for the poor and down trodden. Her ONLY interest - as is the interest of MOST Democrats - is getting out the BLACK vote BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY WAY A DEMOCRAT CAN BE ELECTED TO OFFICE!  

BLACKS in America have come a long way, they have proven that they can stand side by side with the 'elites' and contribute! Without Obama and Clinton to hold them back they will continue to thrive and be productive!"
"You staked your claim on ""hate,"" but hating asparagus is not the same as hating black people for the color of their skin. Sorry racist."
"A scholar of Islamic history at Queen's University in Kingston, Prof. Mohammad Qadeer, wrote: ""The argument about concealing one's face as a religious obligation, is contentious and not backed by the evidence. In western societies, the niqab also is a symbol of distrust for fellow citizens and a statement of self-segregation. The wearer of a face veil is conveying 'I am violated if you look at me'. It is a barrier in civil discourse. It also subverts public trust."" 

Canadian judges should meet their Pakistani colleague, Chief Justice of the Peshawar High Court, Tariq Pervaiz Khan, who ordered female lawyers to remove their face veils, saying they couldn't be identified nor assist court properly while veiled.  He scolded them, saying, ""You are professionals.""

Reza Raheel migrated from Pakistan in 1990 and wrote she has seen a steady rise in numbers of ""Muslim women in the pernicious black tent"" passed off to naïve guilt-ridden Canadians as religious necessity. Referendum on this?"

"Wave. I guess my comments about the inflated salaries and benefits some in corporations give themselves while villagers live hand to mouth was not suitable and was cut.

"(cont.)

I think Brown stands, for many of us, as a great achievement. We like to think that the moment those children made it through the mobs and into the school, something was set right. The actual fallout of Brown, with respect to primary and secondary education for Black children, has not been good. ""Separate and unequal"" describes the conditions of education for a large proportion of Black children, and so the means to prepare for college are significantly lacking, and so while avenues of advancement are nominally open, they are not open effectively, except, for the most part, for those Black people who were comparatively privileged to begin with. After a brief bubble of increased Black presence in higher education, the numbers have been tapering off for decades. Again, I'd refer you to Anderson's book, where the matter is dealt with in some detail."
"Thank you, that clarifies a bit.  In that context elitism is like bigotry and racism, in that a label relieves us of any further thought.  I've met people who will say ""Well, you know how 'they' (liberals, conservatives, Latinos, Blacks......) are"".  I guess accusing someone of 'elitism' is one of those things like conservative or liberal, often misidentified.   What you took as condescension from David Muir may have been only his disbelief that so many people believed Trump's line."
"The  problem the left and all these protesters seem to have is they believe in elections when they win, when they don't they turn to violence and other non-democratic means to try to get their point across.  They only respect the rule of law when they agree with it.  Just look at the occupy movement, the rail blockaides and even a group like black lives matter (they resort to violence and disruption like they did during the pride parade in 2016).  I say protest to your hearts desire, but as soon as the protesters break the law, we should throw the book at them."
"Well, since the esteemed author of this column is not interested in Black History, I suggest everyone who has an interest in sports google, Val James or Larry Doby, both, African Americans with a Canadian connection."

"Trudeau is an wrong. I am an East Indian and One of the reasons I love and came to Canada is for its foreword thinking and allowing  me to live a better life.  My country did a stupid job of that. People come to this country to learn better ways of living and give their children a opportunity for  better lives. We know and they know that their   countries have messed it up. So then why, why do women want to lower themselves to cover up there faces when facing the world?  Why and what are they ashamed of, why don’t the offer there the courtesy of othersto see the when engaging in conversation?  Why live with rules that date black to ancient times. Are they afraid of there men still. Baffles my mind.   I am a male that came from that backward culture and these people make me wonder why the come here but live in the same stupid backwards world they wanted so desperately to leave."
"So blacks should just shut up and accept a little oppression, 'cause you know, there's worse oppression in other parts of the world. Thanks for clarifying your position."

"I would like to challenge President Obama to find any nation in the world whose history isn't messy. Many nations got history that will make US history looked like Care Bears'!! Its appears that slavery was the worst trait of our nation's history But yet compared to other nations, it can be considered to be mild and short lived. For example, Muslim world have been importing black slaves since the 7th century by the millions. But yet left no real descendants of their slaves. So what happened to those slaves, eh? Just remember folks, every single one of us, regardless of our DNA background, all had people in our past who were masters....and slaves in our bloodline. Even Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain can traced her blood to a tanner's daughter who charmed the Duke of Normandy. A serf!!! Her son became William the Conqueror!!

History of any nation will be full of contradiction, hypocrisy and idiosyncrasy."

I see the al-gore rithm  and a few did not like my true comment about how michelle nerobama will right her book about telling kids eating healthy and at the same time she is eating French fries which is true and also when she goes around and making comments about slavery that happened over 140 years ago is truly  trying to stir up trouble and turn it into a racial comment but I guess you liberals like the SA and other commenters with mental disorders can't stand the truth.

"Lol those are your sources? How'd those guys do on the election polls or Brexit? Why not throw Nate silvers garbage polls in there too bud. I simply typed into google American support on immigration polls. The first page which is the most viewed is entirely majority supports trumps ban. I'll follow business insider and time well over CNN or he hill. Granted it is a close poll with the undecided voters being able to swing strongly in either direction. Here's a clear poll from the EU which has by far been the most impacted by refugees and immigrants from Muslim countries predominantly. Huge overwhelming majority want it stopped. No surprise really.  Not hard to read news and see videos of the new atrocities the citizens have faced. Of course it is never aired here. Wonder why?

"Somebody must call a spade a spade.  “When current black students feel unsafe to walk into Deady Hall...""  In view of all the positive life actions of Deady as enumerated above, I conclude that those students who feel unsafe walking into Deady Hall are mentally disturbed.  Or perhaps the students are just being disingenuous and misrepresenting their feelings to achieve a political objective.   I have little sympathy for those who attempt to manipulate us to achieve political objectives especially when they invoke notions of safety where there is no rational danger.  Can any rational human attribute danger to entry to Deady Hall that is related to the name of the building?"

"Sounds like confirmation bias - You found exactly what you were looking for. In reality, Eugene provides FAR more low income housing for the general public than they do for formerly incarcerated citizens who have turned their lives around but are discriminated against through baseless fears.

No woman should be judged by the actions of some women. No black citizen should be judged by the actions of some black citizens. And no one with a criminal record should be judged by the actions of some people with a criminal record.

One in four Americans have been incarcerated. 25%. Our neighborhoods are already PACKED with individuals who moved right into a decent living situation while this group just happens to also be struggling with poverty. Unless opponents are advocating to purge our neighborhoods of a quarter of their residents, it's completely reasonable to understand that the opposition is thoroughly uninformed or intentionally discriminatory - and some are both."
"Since females are a larger ""minority"" than blacks in the US, passing the ERA is a good place to start.  It would also benefit the 50% of blacks who are female.  Both sexism AND racism matter."
"You're right - so why even bother to get out of bed? Oh, wait, because even a black man or woman can become president, if they work at it - unless you are saying that everything was just given to Obama?"
It all started because blacks want the 'right' to not be arrested following their robbing a 7-11. Need to keep this basic point in mind...
"Comparing LGBTQ rights to what blacks went through 60 years ago is way beyond laughable. Please show me a LGBTQ public water-fountain, restaurant table, bus seat, playground equipment and so on."

Someone, somewhere is going to be offended...accept that fact and quit trying to hand everyone a participation trophy.  This goes for everyone by the way, but if you want to be treated as equal, you must first see yourself as equal.  The moment you separate yourself out as different, you are no longer equal.  When people understand that then maybe, just maybe things will change.  Until then, well here we are...and here's your trophy...I guess."

I did not equate Deady and Lincoln's beliefs.  

It is hardly surprising or new information that what was required to get Oregon statehood was what was put into our constitution regarding slavery and negroes.  

The Oregon Blue Book summary on Oregon's Constitutional Convention and Oregon voters:

""Did they want slavery? They voted 7,727 no and 2,645 yes. Did they want freed African-Americans to live in Oregon? They voted eight to one against permitting their residency""

""The question of driving free African-Americans from the new state revealed resoundingly racist attitudes. They did not see freed slaves, Indians, or women standing equally before the law. In this Oregonians differed little from Thomas Jefferson.""

""Oregon would be a free state, yet its newly elected senators--Joseph Lane and Delazon Smith--were proslavery Democrats."""
"Yes we do disagree & if this were not a discussion about supporting, thru priorities, the furtherance of sexism or hatred & oppression of women in Christianity, I would be fine with just disagreeing.  But just as if you were supporting neo-nazism as somewhat Christian or supporting a change in Church rules that could only result in black people being completely segregated from the hierarchy in our church, uniquely, compared to all other races, then I could step aside.  However, this issue is too important to let disagreement appear equally just no matter what side the reader chooses.

If you know that a change will automatically create a situation of increased oppression to one group of people, but that wasn't the plan, you cannot claim innocence of the sin, of the increased oppression, because you knew it would happen and did not change your course, or suggestion of action to others.

Also, there were actually women claiming to be called to priesthood throughout our church's history."
"The tired old ""racism"" charge is getting a played out and isn't working anymore...the left really needs to work on its creativity. 

Don't forget which party used the Klan as its militant wing to keep blacks from participating in elections (Democrats). Let's also not forget who called the late Senator (and Grand Wizard of the K K K) Robert Byrd a ""friend and mentor"". That would be Hillary. Not Trump. But let's not let reality get in the way of you recycled talking points that you borrowed from some leftist cable news channel no one watches"
"You are using too much lipstick on this pig.

"You are so right.  But liberals need to be beat for many reasons.  1. You really don't like to talk about Chicago.  And equating it to Hillary is an insult to Chicago.  2. You don't like to talk about Chicago because it exposes in a real way failed liberal policies.  3. Talking about Chicago means having to explain why you aren't racist.  It means having to explain why you are so cavalier about black on black crime.  If I was a liberal, I wouldn't want to talk about Chicago either."
It's always about black males. There is a refusal to even hint at anything negative about the behaviour of the women and mothers. The lives of some kids are heartbreaking.
"If you were in a workplace where the one black employee was daily called the N-word by other employees, would you support a system where he could complain about it and have it stopped?

If so, that could be called ""legislating hurt feelings,"" and that door has been open quite a few years now."
"I used to be prejudiced against Indians, then I married a Chippewa, I used to be prejudiced towards Natives, now I have a granddaughter who is Haida-Inupiat, I used to be prejudice towards Blacks, then I married one...The ancient Chinese philosophers believed humans become 10 separate personalities by the time they reach the age of 70...it is called maturing & gaining wisdom."
so you're saying it's only political and against Trump and nothing to do with the way blacks are treated in America.
"Nothing to be sorry about. 
Second first:  ""Catholicism has been marginal to the African-American experience"", is to me actually, counter-intuitive. To stay on the margin on a significant value item that is relevant to Christ is itself a statement of betrayal to His mission. 
First: We ""designate"" a saint as patron for a value in the pretense that that value is actively - rather than rhetorically - supported."
"Alas I can say that mural isn't at all representative of my experience with and what I've seen from most black people. Well, the cop part is; but that bit about a black guy sewing feathered peace into the world around him doesn't hold up well to all instances when I and others I've seen were scammed, robbed (once at gunpoint), conned, or threatened or beaten by black people.

I know there's decent ones out there; I've met three of them (yes, only three — but I'm not all that social). But, how many out of how many? Until I start meeting these doves this bit of propagandist art depicts I'm going to believe that most blacks in America have embraced an embittered self-segregating culture of macho violence. Like my idiot inbred Irish distant relatives do in places like West Virginia."

Or the countless video's of their supporters looting and destroying property ?  Or how about the video of all those Clinton and Sanders supporters destroying property in Portland because they are mad Trump won ?   It's very sad that you think those two hundred nuts are part of Trumps supporters because they are not. Since you believe they are , it explains your insane left field comments .  Regardless of what you believe , it's over now . Trump is your president for the next four years ."
"But that's just it:
No baker, not even Mr. Phillips, would ask a straight couple about their sex life or drinking habits or whether the couple gambles. It would be considered rude, an invasion of privacy. The baker would soon be out of business.
But, bakers such as Mr. Phillips don't need to ask rude questions of a gay couple. The evidence of the couple's ""sin"" is standing right in front of the offended baker. Two men. Asking about a wedding cake.
Years ago, I saw a TV news story about racial discrimination. A young woman called an apartment building manager about an apartment for rent. The landlord said he had a unit available. The young woman said the moment she opened the manager's door and walked in, the manager's whole demeanor changed. The manager no longer cared about the woman's income or previous rental history, etc. All the manager cared was that the woman was black. The manager told the woman the apartment was rented. Days later, the ""for rent"" sign was still out front."

But, and this may be one of the issues, is ""offensive artwork"" ""people""? Do ""artists"" have the right to claim that ""offensive artwork"" they are being asked to ""create"" is ""offensive artwork"" and, therefore, is not a ""protected class of people""?

That logical reasoning is why a Jewish baker doesn't have to decorate a Nazi cake with Nazi symbols, why a Black baker doesn't have to decorate a cake showing a man being lynched by the KKK, or a painter doesn't have to paint a painting showing Hillary with horns.

"Exactly. Obama poured oil over troubled waters, calming people in the wake of what appeared to many to be a huge injustice - the stalking of an unarmed teen who was killed while attempting to save his own life from that armed stalker.

There's quite a contrast between the two presidents, Obama speaking to soothe tempers over a perceived injustice, Trump doubling down on his condemnation of those protesting violence against black citizens, calling them ""sons of b****es. Obama was recognized as a peacemaker, Trump earned the contempt of all decent people.

Obama didn't use the fact of black-on-black crime to justify the verdict, which was not that Trayvon was guilty - he wasn't on trial, he was dead, shot by a creepy self-appointed wanna-be cop; Obama pointed out that the jury found reasonable doubt that the armed creep committed intentional murder.

"We are talking about commodities - things that are bought and sold, including art works and antiquities. Basic supply and demand. How could the black market be made less black? Well, obviously law enforcement plays an important role, as do international agreements  that protect archaeological sites, but my primary point is that if people didn't turn a blind eye to the origins of what they are buying, the problem would be lessened. You seem to think this is a trivial issue, but it's not. Sites have been destroyed, museums depleted (look at what happened in Baghdad in 2003, after Rumsfeld declined to station troops at various cultural sites). Museums and collectors are still returning stolen art works to Jewish families."

The reason is that American universities used to have VERY particular about giving tenure and one of the biggest things was a person's research and publishing.

In some sectors, businesses etc., the workforce is 95%+ male (we won't get into the ethnic/racial aspect)...the general turnover in the workforce (at the time) was something like 4% (it may be higher now, but less at larger organizations), and factoring in the fact that women leave jobs as well, you would likely have around a decade and a half, of hiring women 100% of the time, in order to balance the apparent workforce in a given organisation..and quite likely over 2 decades... 

Left unsaid of course, is what you would have to do in teaching, nursing, and other well-paying professions to balance it the other way....not that that would ever be on the agenda, or course...

All of it boggles the mind......"
"The issue at hand is not discrimination against a person, it is against an event.  The baker did not refuse to serve the gay couple; he refused to make a cake for an event celebrating an event which goes against his beliefs.  Had the couple ordered a birthday cake, or a generic cake, or ordered a wedding cake for their straight friend, the cake would have been made because it was not the couple being discriminated against; it was the event.  

Can a black baker refuse to make a birthday cake for a KKK grand dragon?  Can a black baker refuse to make a cake celebrating a KKK anniversary?  

Can a Jewish baker refuse service to a neo-Nazi?  Can a Jewish baker refuse to make a cake for a neo-Nazi protest rally?

"So sad that people had to go through this. I remember once in Juneau, back in the late 50s, my parents were attending a conference of BIA teachers. They went to lunch or dinner at a Juneau restaurant. It so happened that one of the teachers/educators was black. The proprietor of the place came over and informed them they did not serve blacks. So ALL of them got up and left. My Dad would tell that story and I'd just want to cheer!"

"You really think Donald Trump supports such behavior?

That is like blaming Obama or Hilary for the behavior of the Black Lives Matter activists who riot, loot, shut down highways, etc,  when they hold their protests.

"It's understandable that one relate one's life to segments of age, or development- from childhood-adolescence-etc. This is a fruitful reflection. What you describe in implicit terms, is a life that is also measured by your experience along the way and how it affects you; how you related/relate whether to change, intransigence, or a combination of both. I heard part of an interview with Trevor Noah on growing-up in South Africa.  That was the closest I have come to just listening to ""being black"" and not tinged with resistance to one's treatment. 
I write this with respect - you sound so much like people I know, or would like to know yet with the acknowledged difference - within and without - of being of colour.
The ""difference"" though is only hinted at. Maybe you could shed light - being black, catholic, (apparently) of the cafeteria, in a Church you obviously love, an institution that finds excuses for not loving you as a peer because of being ""woman"". How ""black"" frames this. Thanks."

"Diplomacy without a credible threat of force is of little use in dealing with the DPRK, which is determined to make itself a nuclear power.  The North Koreans have a real fear of attack, which massive yearly US/ROK military exercises offshore do nothing to ease.  They are not gathering weapons in order to trade them away, but rather as a means to security.  The Kim dynasty is paranoid but not stupid, and its longtime grip on power shows there is a logic to its actions.

If the US has decided not to allow a missile threat to the homeland, a limited strike would not be wise.  The North would surely retaliate, perhaps by attacking Japanese bases as a way of stirring up Korean nationalism.  Then what?

Iran, another threshold nuclear power, is watching carefully.  One possible approach would be to start a serious military buildup.  This would concentrate the minds of the Chinese and put the ball in the Northern court.  But of course the whole situation  is very dangerous."

"As my employer was developing more communication channels, particularly between management and wage earns in both factory and office, our human resources VP commented:  ""The more you communicate, the more likely that you will  be told you're not communicating enough.""   Raised expectations after recognizing the need.

Expectations of race equality have been raised.

Black issues are not the same now as they were in the late 50's.   That doesn't mean that racism has disappeared.  Black American's still face daily prejudice in all social/economic strata. 

I suspect that black citizens see the conflict primarily as race identity and discrimination in enforcing civil law.   Other's might feel it is a battle of authority(power) and individual freedoms.   Other's view it as a very unsafe community  leading to ultra defensive actions taken by police in support of civil law.

My guess is that all these views are very real and all are probably true some share of the time."
"First, those irrational Arabs of Palestine refused to renounce part of their homeland for European refugees fleeing European anti-Semitism.

You call that judging? Please read Matthew 18:6 and 12:36. God takes our words and their impact on others very seriously.

If one thing has been made clear in the discussions about WO it is that neither side is going to persuade the other, so further argument is worse than worthless because it breeds animosity and mistrust between believers and makes a mockery of truth. More than that, it doesn't matter how right you are, if your view doesn't reflect God's love and redeeming power, you're potentially endangering the salvation of the spiritually weak, as has been illustrated to me in recent days. God wants us to be rivers of the pure, life-giving water of His love quenching the spiritual thirst of the people we meet, not distasteful, polluted streams that send them looking elsewhere for solutions and salvation."

Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things he already said, is a further insult. It’s like eating a watermelon and saying ‘I love African-Americans.’”

Hillary is a strong supporter of health care: she brought the issue to the fore years ago where it remained.

African-Americans overwhelmingly support her. Do you know why?
Minimum wage: $12. Not as high as Bern, but a large improvement.

Immigration: supporter of Obama.
Education: platform calls for free community college; debt-free public university attendance through $2500/year credit.

And that pillar of integrity Loretta Lynch doubled down, praising BLM and calling for more gun control and bringing up several shootings of blacks by cops.

 As far as blackface and other racial stereotyping I hope now, with this incident, most people will understand it's not ""funny"" and is likely to upset other people even if not intended.  With the racial tensions at the university this year common sense would suggest you avoid it except in very special circumstances..

However, dressed as a ""commando"" I don't think anyone would accuse you of wearing  racist ""blackface"" as you were impersonating a standard military technique rather than an actual African-American.
This is in contrast to our Professor who, in her lawyerish apology admitted only to wearing ""black makeup"", not the socially explosive ""blackface"" others saw."
Google his name.  He was a convicted black pimp long before he brought this woman to Oregon.
"This is not about Muslims prayer..This is about hatred, pure and simple. The Bigots will use every trick in the play book to vent their HATE. First it was the blacks, then Jews and now it Muslims."
"Well then, you and the Black Riders have something in common, hatred of Obama and belief that Obama is a racist. Absurd.

I haven't heard anything about Black Riders, probably because they haven't killed anyone or done anything else to get in the news. When they start burning churches and synagogues, holding violent heavily armed rallies, or run over peacenik women with their Dodge Rams, send me a not about it on the forum, as a reminder. But please, no opinions from the Rush Limbaugh types."
"I don't need to know her, and her ""true"" intent was made when she felt it was a good idea to mock an entire race of people for kicks.  I bet she was the belle of the ball with her other friends that likely let her win the costume contest.  My reaction to racism is not part of the problem in the least - the problem is racism, subtle or blatant.  My inability to forgive racist behavior comes from so many ""self-serving"" obligatory apologies, saying she didn't mean to offend anyone and was just (fill in stupid and silly excuse for racism here).  As for judge and jury, her employer is the one threatening her livelihood, not me.  Your anger and ire should be directed toward them, not to an American that finds her behavior offensive.  I bet people like you made excuses for slavery, Jim Crow and still mock Black Lives Matter for wanting police to stop killing them a such an alarming rate.   Spare me your fake outrage at my reaction and not outrage to the racist actions Ray."
"The feds had to get involved in order to legalize mixed race marriages - it wasn't until 1967 that the US Supreme Court struck down state laws outlawing mixed race marriages.

And it wasn't until 1968 that a case claiming religious justification for not serving blacks in a restaurant made it to the Supreme Court."
Typical and expected hate from the completely intolerant left.  The black church that was vandalized down in Dixie with Trump spray painted on the side was done by a black man.  The left represents the most hateful intolerant violent sector of society yet they still whine about losing the presidency and both houses of congress.
"Bud Black did a great job this year and the Rockies Management, I believe, never thought they were going to be a playoff team at the start. Otherwise they might have had at least one reliable veteran starter and a catcher. Black was in a tough spot with Gray blundering the start. Neshek was pitching to way too many guys and then the pitcher comes to the plate. You don't make a change there because it's the damn pitcher. McGee ended up pitching to just one batter and Dunn was never used. That's why managers have gray hair. Great job overall though considering where they were this time last year."
"I believe, a bad choice based on ""black quilt"" or ""we're great because we choose a black women"" or both but certainly not merit. There were many inspirational women of greater merit who courageously fought long and hard for women rights. This woman, Viola, bought a movie ticket for the balcony seats not the more expensive floor seats. She then illegally (not as a black protest)  sat in the floor seat area, was caught, and arrested. She then had to be talked into going to court. She refused to take part in the existing black activist movement. Instead she moved to the USA. She's not an inspiration. Give me two 5 dollar bills please."
"Rookie posters forget, ""All told, at least 12 chief executives—over a quarter of all American presidents—were slave owners during their lifetimes. Of these, eight held slaves while in office.""

"@Alceste -- feel free to research this point on your own.  The CBC/The National coverage of the swearing-in ceremony captures this (at 2:29 in the video if you want to fast-forward) and there are multiple other screen captures from different media at the time.

I guess in this matter we currently have parity:  A 50/50 split between male (Harjit Sajjan) and female members of the Trudeau cabinet exaggerating their contributions."
"It was probably the Trump's speech in Poland that triggered it's release at this moment.  MSW is once again not crediting the true influence of this movement.  It has nothing to do with numbers of adherents, but who they are and the influence they wield.  People should Google Fr James McCluskey OD for more insight into the conservative Catholic dream of a theocracy.  While they are at it the could Google Eric Prince, a close relative of Betsy DeVos and the past CEO of the black ops company that was called Black Water, but has changed it's name a number of times since Prince founded it."
"I saw a chart recently of the most dangerous (rape,murder,violence,robberies etc) cities in the US. The safest cities were the ones with the fewest blacks,the most dangerous cities had the highest vback population. The author was panned as being racist."
"I think you believe that about secularists (whoever the heck they are) because you define ""diversity"" as including (or even celebrating) those who would discriminate against others based on some quality.  For example, when we are commenting on the cake bakers and the gay couple, you (or your identity at the time) wrote that you would be fine with a shop keeper discriminating against Christians or gays or Jews or blacks or whoever because, you know, freedom and honoring diversity. 

One can honor diversity but still push back against bigots."
"> U of T has also offered to help the college with its diversity training.

Yet there were black students there to be offended. 

This really does sound like an off-hand joke that has been blown way out of proportion. But I suppose that is the atmosphere on university campuses these days. 

Watch what you say if you are talking to someone of another ""group"". And certainly be very careful what you put on facebook (even if you think the group is private as it only takes one 'rat' to make everything public). 

You don't want to be accused of something after all."

"I'm not ""loyal"" to Zille, as such – I've never met her, and don't know her. I do tend to stick up for the underdog, though – I don't like to see obvious unfairness.

I agree 100% on De Lille and her pro-development policy. She should never have been given a second term as mayor.

Zille's error was that she tried to rush things. I can understand why – she could see that SA has a limited period in which to rid itself of the ANC, or it will be too late. She wanted the DA to take power as soon as possible, so that SA could be turned back from the precipice. To do that, the DA needed the black vote. To do that, the DA needed (in her mind) a black leader. THAT is where things went wrong. Her choices of possible black leaders for the DA have been abysmal. What we have now is a DA that probably WON'T be able to save SA, because it is rapidly turning into the ANC. Coalition government may still save us, but however we look at it, our future is depressingly uncertain."
"Polling of favorability shows a steep plunge for the NFL since this controversy started, especially among the core 24-59 male demographic.  Fake news outlets and TDS sufferers notwithstanding, Trump appears to have hit the narrow politics of this issue exactly right.

I personally despise police brutality and am convinced that blacks people are horribly victimized by law enforcement in the US, and so I urge the athletes and others to seek a less alienating way to raise consciousness."
"Article in the Star today about the guy who wanted the tree on his front property moved because of his religious beliefs.

This is the type of thinking that is being allowed to immigrate and move into Canada.

This is beyond belief...a tree and his religious beliefs. It doesn't get more ridiculous than this.

Or the woman in Mississauga who demanded to be fully covered from head to toe in black, in public, because of her 'religious' beliefs. She went to the courts to be allowed to stay in her dark cave of thinking and culture.

This is what is being allowed to immigrate into Canada, and will gradually shape the policies of Canada."
"A case of the pot calling the kettle black. I am still waiting for Bush 43 to apologize for promoting a constitutional amendment against gay marriage in his 2004 State of the Union address. Then there is the business about the wars in the Middle East and the irresponsible income tax cuts that took place at about the same time. More than 14 years after the US invasion of Iraq, the Middle East remains an unstable part of the world, millions of people have been displaced and an unknown number have been killed. Although most Americans were untouched by the wars, there is a large protest memorial (put up by a local landowner) across from my local commuter train station. The hillside display is filled with thousands of crosses and other religious symbols, each one marking  a member of the US armed forces who was killed in Iraq or Afghanistan."
"(Part two of three)  Human consciousness is creation-consciousness, inseparable from Creation/ Creator Consciousness.—sylvester(pat)steffen seems like a convoluted way of writing, “the word of life—for the life was made visible; we have seen it and testify to it” (1 John 1:1-2).

Am I handing Hitler posthumous victories?—John Hobson  Rather than looking back, like the historian I am, look forward, where historians have little to no business.  Try taking on a Black identity to see whether a Black identity is American identity at its finest.  Land of the free, home of the brave . . . no better found than in the African-American experience.  While the Black experience highlights the American Dilemma, the Black experience also highlights the American Dream, for without the Dilemma, there would be no Dream and without a Dream there would be no Dilemma."

"I can believe that blacks (particularly young black males) may be stopped more frequently by the police than other 'groups'. I've heard that often enough elsewhere. 

However I find it hard to believe people frequently make 'racist comments' in Toronto as I assume I would have witnessed some of this as I traveled around the city. And, quite frankly, I cannot recall a single instance where people directed racist comments at other people, including situations where someone got into an argument with someone else."
"Your argument is a contradiction. 

1. We should force teams to meet certain selection criteria with regards to race.  By example the team must contain X number of race Y. The team must not be selected on merit alone. 
    
then you argue 
2. No players of race Y are picked on the basis of being race Y, they are there on merit. 

These statements are mutually exclusive, if 2 is true then 1 is unnecessary. If 1 is true then to argue 2 is absurd. 

So are you saying we should enforce a unnecessary rule on society or are you comfortable with living in your own absurd reality?

No one is saying putting don't put black people in the team. The argument is whether teams should be forced to pick black players in order to meet a percentage."
"I haven't seen anywhere that the President specifically called out Ms Heyer as antifa, BLM, or similar.  If her mother assumed Trump was talking about her daughter when he pointed out that there were violent counter protesters present, maybe there's a reason.  I have no idea one way or the other."
"I did not say we, as a nation, had accomplished the goal of equal opportunity. I said we should assure it to the greatest extent possible. It's a work in progress! You have to admit, we've made progress. If the opposite were true, as you state, we'd have black people still enslaved today. That would really be outrageous and something for which we would not stand. I'll admit, though, we still have much to do in the way of equality and bias.
Moving forward, as I used it, means we cannot allow the mistakes of the past and whatever guilt they may produce, to impede our progress in attaining the goal of equal opportunity."
"“This not guilty verdict of a police officer who violently killed a citizen is another slap in the face to the black community in St. Louis. And a shot in the heart to the family of the victim,” Missouri State Rep. Michael Butler, D-St. Louis, said in a statement issued Friday morning, adding that the verdict has left him “appalled.”

Too bad Mr. Butler isn't appalled by the actions of the member of the black community who placed numerous citizens, residents and law enforcement officers in harms way.  Don't attack police officers with a deadly weapon (the car) while carrying another deadly weapon and you have virtually a 100% chance of surviving every encounter with law enforcement.  Pretty simple actually. Maybe Mr Butler's oratory ""skills"" could be put to better use employing the black community to be better members of their community instead of lawless thugs.  Nah, doesn't fit the victim narrative of the progressives . . ."
"4. ""More factories are being built in America, especially the industrial Mid-west.""

"The work permit is only part of the equation. 

For an employer to employ someone with a general work permit the following applies according to

""General Work Visa
The General work visa is issued to a foreign employee who has obtained a position with a SA company. The visa will only be issued if the employer demonstrates that national job recruitment efforts in the local media were fruitless...""

This process is arduous and can take manymonths to conclude. Not many employers are able to wait while these processes are complied with, leading them not to consider foreign nationals.

Scarce skills visas require ...""The applicant must demonstrate that they have said critical skills such as holding an advanced degree or publications in their field. They must register with the specialized SA professional group...""

"Choking a man to death on a street corner for selling cigarettes or shooting one in the back as he runs away isn't the result of ' unfortunate events'?  It also seems to me the problem is trying to put all these different killings/murders under one broad umbrella explanation.  They ought to be understood in their immediate and broader context, a context with multiple dimensions.  It doesnt help when the lawyer representing her family, who has also represented the families of other victims such as Castille (shot to death in his car with the baby in the back seat, after telling the cop he had a gun in the car, had a permit to carry, etc.) says she is the most innocent victim ever.  Why?  How many women of colour have called police only to end of death at their hands?  His comment to me shows how deep-seated and often unconscious racial prejudice is, let's not pretend its not a major contextual factor in police interactions...it is not however always the only one."
"How do you know they don't focus on reading, writing etc? Have you ever been to one? Your comparison to all black schools in the 1960's sooth is weak. It is more comparable to HCBUs, where blacks voluntarily decided to form there own colleges, not they were forced to by the people in power. Unless they are advocating violent actions, homeland security ha no business. The are free to petition the govt to redress their wrongs, are they not?"
"Oh sweet irony.  The gist of the BLM message is they expect to resolve their concerns (of being unfairly stereotyped by the police) by stereotyping all members of the Toronto Police Services as being racist against blacks..  

How does this decision help their cause or the LGBTQ community?   From most accounts, the presence of the TPS at Pride was welcome."
"Yep, Trudeau sends that Haitian MP down to Florida to tell the Haitian community that they won't gain any advantages by coming into the country ""Irregularly"" but never tells the community NOT to come.

Illegal, legal, black men calling slaves immigrants - one can, one can't, hate of a President putting the brakes on; and no understanding that we have a government agency whose job is to determine that. Why no discussion on what their rules are and whether they should change? 
And if so, how much one way or another?
Why will that not be discussed in lieu of silly protests and marches and disobedience?
I would like the writer of this column to give us his thoughts on that. Give it a try?"
"Your probably part of the America that does not understand that America has a history past an present of pissing on Natives, Blacks, Chinese, Japanese etc. etc.. so understandably there are people of all walks of life that feel free to exercise their freedom as Americans to protest."
"Unfortunately Obama arrived probably ten years too soon and he was black. For the bigots that became a rallying cry. He had all the attributes to become a great president. He was articulate, very intelligent and most of all, believably compassionate. One got the feeling that he really cared. He made us all believe in ""Yes, we can"". 

Then again maybe he was the right president. If not for him, the world economy would have been in much worse shape today. Just think what would have happened if a Trump withdrew the US from the world in 2008.

Unfortunately, the Democrats lost the house early and that hobbled him. The disappointment of the unfulfilled promise and a poor candidate cost the Democrats the election and opened the way for the worst ever president of the US. He is not a conservative and neither are most of his supporters.

These people are not fighting liberalism, they are fighting the system, where corporations can take everything away from you, because China makes it cheaper."
"""...You are saying that extreme black on black violence and carnage is not news for the MSM.
Is that correct?...""

No, you're saying that to create something out of nothing.  If one isn't smart enough to dig deeper than the fluff that's thrown in their face by biased news media (which exists on ALL sides), then they're probably an idiot and not worth talking to.  

The problems in Chicago do not preclude the problems in Charlotte, the idiocy of Trump, any extreme left wing group that supports racist behavior, or any reprehensible behavior at all.  Even a person of average intelligence can consider many issues without having to exclude the others.  

The problem we're dealing with here is that those with questionable behavior immediately deflect and try to point at problems elsewhere, and those that support them do the same.  Reality is Trump is a racist who is supported by racist morons and he didn't have the courage to call them out, just as many other politicians have done."
"""A lot of that has to do with the poor public schools they go to. However, it is always implied to Republican voters that the blacks are not good enough to go to college"".

Are the Pride organizers (taken over by Black Lives matter) too dumb to recognize the irony of only the police to participate by hiding who they are?

"Campbell may have a point about the constitutional free speech protections held by students, but there IS a supreme court backed decision that limits student's speech. This summary is succinct: ""A student’s speech... may not be censored... unless it is reasonably clear that it will ignite significant disruption or collide with the legal rights of others.""
Of course, the devil is in the term ""reasonably clear"" that it will invite ""significant"" disruption. Does hate speech meet this criteria? And what is hate speech? For example, students are known to say ""I hate you."" What if they say ""I hate Blacks""?  Or use the ""N"" word. (yes, being sensitive or politically correct here).

"Geraldine, your feeble mind has failed you. Publicity for gay rights? Is that what MLK was doing with his marches, publicizing black rights? How about Fourth of July parades? It's terrible when people draw attention to themselves and their causes. Religious rights? This cake baker is advertising his cause. He is the one pushing the issue. What about the rights of someone who wants to not serve or hire blacks, Hispanics, women, Indians, Muslims, etc? What about the rights of someone who wants to enslave another?"
"It is not about race, it is about economics.  Authors like the person who wrote this article always want to make it about race.  It is about poverty.  If Trump can find ways to help people in inner cities (no matter the color of the their skin) get jobs, if he starts enforcing the laws and puts criminals in jail, and creates an environment where people can be successful, then those in the inner cities will flourish.  Black America has a strong tradition of black owned businesses, particularly during the years of racism in the south.  Successive democrats have convinced blacks that the Government can help them better than they can help themselves.  The best thing government can do is to support economic development.  As Ronald Reagan said the worst words in the English language are ""I'm from the government and I am here to help."""
"Emotionally instabile people . There is no mechanism to lock them up. So we have to use our own judgement to protect ourselves. The wife of the murderer should probably have known by his previous behavior she is in danger and carried a gun all the time. Also good to keep in mind:  In 2013, a black was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder.  https://www.amren.com/archives/reports/the-color-of-crime-2016-revised-edition/  just yesterday gym owners/supervisors were killed by a black employee."
"Trump won a lot of counties with more livestock than people. A Wyoming voter counted for four times as much as a California voter; this is Constitutional, since a black person in the original Constitution counted for 0.6% of a vote, and a slaveholder with 100 slaves, controlled 61 votes.  So the Wyoming voter with five steers controls four votes. Now, THAT's democracy!"
"I don't know. I wouldn't support it because it is easy to imagine it as a kind of hate speech. It would be stupid though, because people would definitely let you know how they felt about such garb. More power to them, I say. 

But again, you make a false equivalency. How is a KKK hood and a freely chosen niqab the same? I can see why a black person would be harmed by a troop of KKK people on the subway. How are you harmed by a group of women with a niqab?"
"Radir, learn that police officer is not the most dangerous job. Learn that danger on the job does not grant you special privileges nor eliminate regulatory oversight. You need a citation to prove that no ACLU lawyer could or would be a police officer. Plenty of cops have gone on to be lawyers. Even former prison inmates have become lawyers. Remember that blacks can't play sports."
"There is nobody on this sight in the four years I've been writing that has worked any harder than I have to fight against bigotry and racism, specific to the area.  Most bigotry goes unrecognized and denied, because most have near zero experience or empathy  with black lives.

But if you're talking to me, it just shows that ignorance knows no one particular ideology.   I've said I'd vote for a dead horse before I voted for trump.  I've said nothing that implies racism to the site (although I've been accused of reverse racism).

Cleary you don't know a thing about me, but you want to play pious and accuse me of something that in no way I deserve.   

Nice introduction of yourself to what for the most part is a civil chat.   Your ignorance and lack of empathy for others can be your calling card."
"Free speech protects protests from Nazis and from black lives matters not just one political agenda.  All nuts are covered!  I didn't mention anything about the ones screaming fire or threatening to bomb someone, i am talking about free speech and if someone has the right to say they hate police and that it is okay to kill police then it is alright for a crazy group like the KKK to voice their opinions."
"""It is hard to see the Trump Presidency as anything other than a direct repudiation of the racial rapprochement, and comity, that the previous election of Barack Obama once promised.

I fail to see anything but complete failure on Obama's part to fulfill the promise referred to. What I saw was the rise of BLM and a spike in the temperature of the racial conversation. I believe the black community at large and its well respected leaders across America also failed, miserably, by not standing up and demanding more from Obama.

America voted for change. Real change. Not a repeat of failure by Hillary and Bill and Barack. And if the black community wants to share in that change they should be working with Trump vs. the ridiculous references to the KKK which hold as much water as a resurgence of the Black Panthers or the SLA.

Lastly, I worry about the state of education is this is the level of insight and knowledge being delivered."
"I've been thinking the same thing, that's how the game is these days for the most part. No sacrifices or anything like that because teams don't want to give up outs and are instead willing to roll the dice on getting multiple hits or a home run.

Time for Black to seriously consider trying to manufacture some runs (bunts, hit & run, stolen bases, etc.) since this offense has gone in the tank. I think the make up of the lineup tonight will tell a lot about how Black is approaching this game with the offense in a complete stall."
"Black Lives Matter, and so Blacks lecture the Church to raise consciousness.

Then why do Black people kill more Black people more than any other race?  Why are Black people more prone to violent acts than any other demographic group in America?

Who will lecture Black people on this inconvenient truth?   Not NCR, that's for sure."
"Where in the New Testament are followers of Jesus told to take physical violence against anyone for any reason? Christ did command ""turn the other cheek ... go the second mile ... love your enemies,"" did He not? Why do those who are zealous for following the Bible so often ignore Bible teachings? In the end are they following Scripture or their own, sinful ideas?"
"My own take is that the underlying agenda here is to unseat the Middle East in terms of power.   Seeing Trump's comments in the past and Putin's comments in the past, they both regard  it with contempt.  Putin has a big issue with the terrorism on his doorstep, both from the Middle East and pawns like Chechnya.  Even more so than does the U.S.A.  If you look at the oil situation here in North America now, and  also consider the possibility that Venezuela can be redeemed economically and politically, and add to that the might of Russia's oil producing capacity, an interesting opportunity presents itself.   That being an embargo on Middle East states who promote terrorism both by funding and political ties.  We could not have done that two decades ago, now perhaps we can.   The world managed to turn South Africa from apartheid in the 90's.  It would be a wonderful thing for this world if Islamic terrorism faced the same fate as apartheid."
"Nigeria and China just inked a major deal where the Chinese will be investing billions of dollars in this depressed economy.   Much to the delight of the destitue Nigerians, in short order they will be owned my the Chinese so perhaps they will put an end to the enslaught."
"And you have accused me of fantasy, and of cooking up fairy tails. Take a pill and reflect, AT, on knowable facts, which don't include your facile assumptions about the movie-watching habits of people you don't know. We know from the videos of the last election campaign, however, that a whole lot of Republicans hate with a vengeance every liberal, every inner-city black who doesn't ""Stepenfetchit"", every migrant worker who brings salad to your table, and every person who wears a scarf over her/his head. Back off a little, think more, relax, and put away your attitude. Make friends. As Trump says, we all must unite as a country behind Il Duce."
"It is not that they are complaining as much as HOW they are complaining and about what.

There is no rise in shootings of blacks by police.
They have created a false straw-man to justify insulting a Heritage many hold dear.

They are free to demonstrate the 'deeply held beliefs' on their own time.

Or actually use some of their huge salaries to better publicize their discontents."
"""To be clear: Every bishop is concerned about religious liberty, as they should be, as all Americans should be. The question is whether the histrionic approach to the issue is truthful or helpful.""

Traditionalists seized upon religious liberty not because they care that much about religious liberty but because it provides a backdoor for tackling their Top 4 or 5 Sex Topics. What is scandalous is that they believe they have a right to impinge upon the civil liberties of others by making decisions for people outside a Catholic religious framework."
"Do these players even know what it is they are protesting?  Capernick started a protest about the disproportionate number of blacks incarcerated in American prisons.  Maybe he doesn't realize that the number of people (regardless of race) in prison is based upon the number of people convicted of crimes.  Wouldn't it be a better effort to try to make it so less crimes are committed?  Protesting a sad fact seems awful hollow, it is like protesting that there is too much rain in Washington.  Even worse, protesting that certain people should not go to jail would seem to encourage those people in their criminal pursuits because famous athletes ""feel"" for them."
"I am not stupid, or racist, nor homophobic. I believe in enforcing the laws long on the books concerning borders and immigration. I believe our president should follow the law and address Congress, not the UN, when deciding major issues that greatly affect our Country. I believe globalism is the death of America. I believe that the 2nd amendment is a God-given right. It's not about deer hunting, that is a stupid. And I believe that calling people who you do not understand nor agree with racists and other names are simply bully tactics the left has used successfully for years. But the folks who earn taxes to pay for the social and global programs that the left (and ""right"") shove down our throats are about done with that.

Anyway, I'd rather be thought of as stupid by people who love obama than be thought of as smart by them. My gay friends and black friends agree. And the gal at the Target wearing a hijab asked me to pray for her son, after noticing my cross. Or was that Taqiyya...?"
"... after the Oscars made overdue history by awarding best actor to Denzel Washington and best actress to Halle Berry, the first time black actors won both top performing honours in the same year. It’s a feat that hasn’t been repeated since.

========================

Blacks make up 13% of the population of the U.S. When you consider that a good proportion of the actors nominated come from the UK, France, Canada, and other countries with a smaller black population than the U.S., a 1 in 10 ratio is probably closer to representative of the overall actor pool. That means in any given year, if blacks were represented in leading screen roles proportional to their share of the overall population nominations are drawn from, we should expect 1. of the 10 best actor nominations  to go to a black actor - or one every two years for each of the lead acting categories. So statistically, both a black actor and actress winning the Oscar  in the same year should be extraordinarily rare."
"National news is broadcasting that the RNC is stepping up efforts to try and court black voters.  Yeah, the only time the RNC or a Republican presidential candidate pays attention to the black voters is ONLY during a general election.  Otherwise the black voters are only and after thought.  You can also bet that black voters are paying attention to the inaction of Republican controlled state legislators and Congress who are blocking responsible gun control.  Republicans should lose control of Congress just based on that technicality."
"How does that American experience for those children of Europe compared to slaves torn from their wives and children, facing a lifetime (not 7 years), of being treated as property threatened with death and subject to rape, forcibly separated from family because you are sold.

If you care about our black citizens, then go into their homes, live in their shoes in  Chicago, then come back and tell us your experience.  

I believe your intent is to help your black friends is sincere, but I don't think you've been in their shoes."
"This is a left wing pipe dream that the blacks came up with years ago as a way to make their 13% of the population more powerful at the ballot box. Thankfully, our constitution is very hard to change and this kind of baloney won't fly."
"No one is 'forcing"" this bigoted baker to do anything. He can be hateful towards gays, jews, blacks and women all he likes in his personal life. He can believe anything he wants about groups the disagrees even though it's highly irrational.
But what when he avails himself to the public marketplace he should either abide by the proscribed rules or quit. There is nothing that says baking cakes is practicing religion and nothing about the law that he violated that requires him to believe anything.

I think something that isn't explored is that 99% of those who claim this religions exemption only target one group - homosexuals. They never target adultery or other sins that the bible talks about. This to me shows that it's not really about religion at all."

"May I suggest looking at the polls between Trump and Clinton at realclearpolitics.  Trump leads only in state, Georgia.  Trump is a nativist.  He is trying to model the GOP into a nativist party.  As such he has lost the minorities including Hispanics and Blacks.  No candidate has ever won this way.  Look at history.  Trump will not win.  His splitting the voters is his doom."
everyone knows you stay still until the officer reaches your window. you don't make any movements until they tell you. the officer is not guilty just following procedure. stay still if you are ever pulled over. you hunch or slouch or move cops are trained to take that as a sign of aggression or reaching for a weapon. so this was a case where the black guy got himself shot by being careless in front of police. an accident yes but a truly careless one at that.

"Thank you for sharing this story. I join you in applauding those students, and celebrating their achievement. I tend to take this event as a coda to the earlier devastation of the Black Power movement, and particularly the assassination of Fred Hampton. Personally, I thought that the Panthers' political analysis and program was more coherent, compelling, and pertinent to the general population, which was why they were targeted so viciously. The attack on Move, I think, served to show that even a marginal and not especially charismatic organization was more than could be tolerated, and could be crushed with impunity. 

At present, there is more and more information about our racist history entering the public sphere. This gives me hope that the privileged comfort of ignorance and denial will become much harder to preserve. The Black Lives Matter movement also gives me hope. It's a difficult time, but with much opportunity. God Bless."

"Yes, a nice simple solution.  However, why should the academic community have to accommodate bigotry?

Would we have said the same sort of thing in the 1950s when too many hotels and conference facilities would bar Jews, Blacks, etc? Would our answer have been that if a conference wanted to include such people then they bloody well should hunt around for some facility that would accommodate them and, meanwhile, stop complaining?"
"Eugene, one question I haven't seen asked yet is, ""Given the history of blackface in America, how  would a typical  African-American student or faculty person  have felt walking in to that party and seeing the lady in blackface? ""

Or,
2)  would  have had a sick feeling  in the pit of their stomach and said 'hey lets'  get out of here.""

Not being a black person myself it's not my responsibility to judge, but I'd say the answer to this question would suggest what the appropriate punishment for this professor might be."
"""...it comes at a time of increasing frustration that 23 years into democracy the face of poverty remains black and overwhelmingly female....""

Yes, Ms. Wente quoted facts. Then, many would argue, she arrives at an erroneous conclusion (""good news."")  Happens all the time. I suspect she did so to grab readers. She's excellent at doing that.

"He actually has several hotels overseas, including some in the middle east.   You don't mean 'conspiracy theory' sexist 'you have to vote for me because I am a woman' Hillary do you?  Also,  it is the left that has race on the brain.   I for one do not oppose Obama because of his skin color.  I would have happily voted for Ben Carson if he had lasted.  Also, another candidate I would have voted for was Carly Fiona.   So let us not say I'm sexist.  As far as Trump's competency is concerned, he had to have some to get the hotels built.   
I also agree Obama's record of disasters speaks for itself.  I believe that Obama's record is one of those subjects that we are going to  have to agree to disagree on."
"They wake up every morning and think, ""What really dickish, annoying things can I do today?""

We already know that you're a racist who doesn't think black lives matter.
"You sir, are so badly misinformed about this election you should have your voter registration taken away.  The biggest thing to come out of this election is Trump aversion to hire all of those failed campaign professionals that the RNC stuck McClain and Romney with.  Trump isn't running his campaign like those of the past.  He has virtually no ground game except for those organizing as volunteers to door knock their neighborhoods, wave rally banners on busy road junctions and use the Trump Talk program to make phone calls from home to registered voters using their computer system.  Trump will collect the strong support of all GOP members and also a very large number of Hispanics, Blacks and women who are so feed up with Clinton's actions towards them.  Then add in near 90% of all active duty and veterans of our military,  Another 90% of all Police, First Responder's and Fireman.  Then add in all Border Patrol, ICE and Secret Service personnel.

He addresses the ""Shut up and play"" demands of fans. We like our sports figures to be one dimensional. They have nothing beyond their prowess. Fans are shocked when they have the gall to protest anything. From the Olympics, to football and basketball, we want athletes to stay in their place. After a number of killings by police of unarmed black men, THESE black men chose to not remain silent. Their teammates - brothers in battle - supported them, even if disagreeing.

I again asked them to stop, and left the room. I don't think I needed to hear more before passing judgement. And I don't think I would ever agree with their nasty comments."
"I didn't realize, you, Mr. Black, was/is the dictator of what or who are real subsistence hunters.

I appoint myself to be the tell all and dictator of who is or who isn't a real western cultured human. One question I'd like to know. Have you or any of your relatives rode in a covered wagon? And are you a good shot with ball n musket. Or are you totally caveman and carry a club?"

"As I seem to recall, the only time the Trump campaign was seriously knocked off course was when the 10 year old video surfaced of Trump making gross comments about groping women. The reaction and outrage was instant and absolutely no one defended his remarks in any way shape or form and a rather shaky Donald Trump got on TV to apologize. 

Yet given all that (presumably whatever happened actually doesn't matter) we still have the ""War on Women"". (And I could cite other examples of men being fired over making offensive comments, etc. But I'll leave it at that.) 

And I guess my comment won't pass Black Swan's test about being ""constructive or supportive"". 

So in other words ""guys"" (and a few women might fall into this category as well), if you don't agree go away and shut up."

One of your ilk, Al Sharpton, the infamous tax dodger, race baiter, and anti-Semite, does not think that blacks/progressives should support the Jefferson Memorial or the Washington Monument.

"Unfortunately, we all live in a country where the Constitution protects free speech.  That is ALL FREE SPEECH, not just the speech you agree with.

As for your apparent hatred of our president and expectation of a ""perfect"" world where everything you want comes true, well sorry to burst your bubble, but it ain't going to happen.  So best you grow up and start dealing with reality and acting like an adult.  Talk to people who disagree with your point of view, because your prejudices will be the only thing you stand to lose.  In fact, why don't you become a police officer in a black community, not a middle class one like on TV's ""Blackish"", but a poor community like Detroit or Baltimore.  Let's see how you survive."

"It is evident from the reporting and commentary on this large demonstration that the mainstream media decided not to send reporters to the event. All of the subsequent reports/comments are based on watching a short video which covered a tiny fraction of the overall event.  One has to ask why there were no reporters assigned to the demonstration, particularly when very small protests from  groups such as Black Lives Matter and Idle No More receive extensive coverage, which dutifully and earnestly repeats those groups' messages.  Is the lack of actual coverage of the demonstration because the mainstream media did not want to report that a large number of  ordinary Canadians were protesting job-destroying carbon taxes?"

However, between Memorial Day and a few weeks past Labour Day,  my Church has a march every Friday at 7:00 pm, through our South Side parish. The rout is set in consultation with the police, generally, who let our priest know which blocks have been most tense and problematic. We chant any number of things, and ""Black lives matter,"" is one of the prominent refrains. Also, ""Put the guns down,"" ""Save the babies,"" ""We love you, your are brothers, we love you, your our sons,"" and various other such things. Towards the end of this Summer, we went to the house of a neighborhood gang leader, to call him out, and offer support for him to change. We stopped at the local precinct house, to applaud, bless, and pray over the officers last month. And there have been larger marches in the city, last Good Friday, for instance, and a few others since then.

"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.
Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.”
Ungrateful is the new uppity.
Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.
Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."

We know law enforcement for rape is fraudulent and complicit in India, Africa, and Asian countries, among others. But mountains of evidence indicate it is not considered a serious, violent crime in the US either. Processing rape kits wasn't even a national issue until recently when enough women (a small number) took law enforcement positions of power and asserted our safety priorities. This is an example of why women must plan, work toward and take on leadership positions. Maybe our new legislature will vote yes on a second opportunity to pass a bill that requires holdout AK police departments to immediately get their shelved sexual assault kits tested. But we have to outvote all the rapists and sympathizers in Alaska in order to elect ourselves an honest, equal rights majority caucus in Juneau who will finally enact laws that women and children need."
"yes because being the butt of racial jokes from a so-called respected member of your faculty -  a person in a power position, likely having the ability to affect one's life- when one is already constantly beleaguered by racial animus inside and outside that enclave is no big deal.  If its not, then I assume there wont be any more whining on these sites from the privileged class about being described as racists.  We should all just get over it, 'act like adults and move on'-odd definition of 'adult' btw. Do you have a clue how humiliating such a comment might be for that young person? Sessions talked recently about how humiliated he was by his boss and a former colleague pointed out that he should remember that feeling because that's how black people have felt with his treatment them.

Would you rate the intelligence of any of the bullies and haters caught on camera as being smarter than average? or even, of average intelligence? Of course, people of low intelligence can be decent and likeable. but can you make that judgement about those thugs and bigots?

"It appears the main effect of Motor Voter registration is to register more people who don't care enough to make even the minor effort needed to vote.

This makes sense. If a person is not motivated to take the simple steps needed to register as a voter on their own, they are far less likely to vote, even when our state makes that so easy with mail-in ballots. In states that still require voters to go to the polls, these folks would be even less likely to make the effort to vote.

When Republicans who want to require voter ID to avoid potential voting fraud are accused of suppressing minority voters, I don't believe it. Registering and voting requires only a minor effort, but  if a person doesn't care enough to do the first, they probably aren't going to care enough to do the second. The arguments for why anyone can't do these simple things are just silly, and according to some blacks, racist.

The outcome? They want someone in power who will make sure blacks will never be in charge of their state, they want someone in charge to make sure gays will never be treated like human beings in their state.

It seems that I, a fellow citizen – unlike my Black friend – and others who think like me, live in quite a different universe where we know that much of what is going on in Zuptaland (including in the African National Congress) is wrong, indefensible and terribly harmful to the nation and all its peoples. Were I a Black citizen in Zuptaland, I would hope I wake up soon, open my eyes, and raise my voice and shout: ""This is wrong. Why do you allow it, ANC?"""

"It's what you said about a black female poster--the widow of an Iraq war veteran--who disagreed with you under the old ""comments"" system.  I'm sure you'd rather forget it.  I didn't.  Don't think she has either (we're friends on FaceBook--I'll ask her).  And I don't need to judge you.  Your own words do that."
"The Jones Act was immediately lifted to help Texas and Florida.
It took the nation two weeks of shaming Trump before he acted to help Puerto Rico.
He spent that time making lame and nonsensical excuses for why he couldn't lift the ban.

Yep, the plantation is under threat by the uppitys all over again. Trump is a racist.
And a traitor."
"Mr. Haase: A ""flag-drapped coffin"" is a very big deal to, I would hope, all of us.  As has been repeatedly stated, the ""take a knee"" movement was, first, to protest the police shootings of unarmed black men, then it grew to represent a support of First Amendment Rights.  Yet some, such as you, seek to demonize those who demonstrated as callous, unAmerican uncaring villians.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Mr. Kaepernick took a stand...a courageous stand for something in which he believed......that is, equal justice for all.  That's an American value worth supporting......it's a ""big deal"" too.  
You state ""Yes, it is their right to disrespect the flag and the blood of the men and women whom died to set them free. "" That's an untrue and truly horrible acccusation.  The ""take a knee"" protests are certainly not a ""pout."" They are open protests addressing specif grievances and embody our First Amendment Rights.  IMO, as such they dishonor no one.  Gary Crum"
""" it goes against human nature""
Mmmm, not always. There are variants to all things in nature. If I had my druthers, or had it been an option in my youth, I would have gladly been ""normal"". The fact is that the ""normal"" mold didn't fit, try as I might. The truth, the fact, the reality is that 1 on 10 people are homo, gay, queer, lesbian, that way, bat for the other team, kick with the other foot, jumped the fence, are lesbo, fag, dyke. I was raised by two heteros, God love them, but am homo just the same."

More democratic entitlement. The question is: what is black America going to do to fix its relationship with Donald Trump.  Trump owes black America nothing.
"Hey Renzetti, there's a famine going on in South Sudan. Millions of people are at risk. How come you never write about that? Why will you go back to bashing Trump next week again? More important to you than millions of black lives?"
"I love your victim blaming. The fault is clearly the officer's, or his training.  On a stop involving a missing taillight, the first mistake was going up to the car with gun out.  And what don't you get about Black Lives Matter?  It means exactly ""all lives matter.""  I love the poor attempt to spin it into a anti-racial attempt, but you can't ignore racism in this country, and you can't have ""All Lives Matter"" without having ""Black Lives Matter"" too."
"""...and aided by Republican-led efforts to dampen black and Latino voting in states like North Carolina,...""

"Options abound if NFL players want to protest: Interviews; Organizing anti-discrimination groups; Giving to charities and groups so involved and others I can't think of. 
The original intent of Kaepernick was to disrespect the flag because, as he said the first time he was interviewed about it,  
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. 
""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" He deemed the entire country guilty of racism and violence against blacks when the vast majority of black killings are black on black. 
Teaching blacks to respect the police and follow lawful orders would be a really good start. Those who sow seeds of distrust of authority for political gain should be condemned."
"A Democrat movement to Resist the Trump Agenda can bury the Democrats deeper in 2020.
*
What Democrats need to fear most is Trump accomplishing his agenda in the next 4 years. 
*
For one of Trump's agenda was the promise he made to Blacks and Latinos during the election ----  bring Blacks and Latinos into the mainstream economy.
* 
Latinos and Blacks, although long ignored and neglected by Democrats, would begin supporting Trump when Trump begins fulfilling his agenda to help Latinos and Blacks get into the mainstream economy.
*
Democrats who do not recognize this very fact of Trump's agenda, thinking that Latinos and Blacks are their bread and butter, would discover in 2020 that the Latinos who gave Clinton the popularity vote majority by winning over 61% of the vote in California would desert them for Trump in 2020."
"NFL = disrespectful, mostly black men airing their contempt for the USA by kneeling during our National Anthem. Personally, I stand for the flag but kneel for the cross."
"Very tired of these Denver pro sports team coaches coddling and stroking ( 'that's baseball' ; 'that's the way it goes sometimes' ) these millionaire athletes. Where is the fire and brimstone?? Black, Joseph, Sakic etc."
Civil forfeiture is a shameful black mark on BC. It is time for the NDP government to own up to its promises and eliminate this callous disregard for individual rights.
"Nonsense Bill.    If somebody want to protest the Black Lives Matters and call it racist, they can take all the same risk the Colin Kaepernick has had to face.    For that matter 'here's your sign.....""

Kaepernick has sacrificed his career and a lot of personal wealth on this issue. He's been threatened by powerful people nation wide and mocked by a President who has nothing better to do.

If somebody want to stand in front of national television with a No BLM sign let him do it.   Hell, Jerry Jones will probably hire him tomorrow, if not in football than as a trophy to give to the President."
"You just gave further proof that nobody knows what anyone is protesting for during the National Anthem.  One big mud pool.  Someone please attach signs to each protesting players so we know what each is protesting.  As for which message I support Kap that he was protesting during the National Anthem that I support is the Police brutality (and not just against Blacks, even though more Blacks are affected by the Police).  I am not supporting Kap regarding the U.S. govt issue - which was NOT what he knelt for (for clarification to those reading, this U.S. govt issue was when Kap was seen wearing a T-shirt with that message).  Regarding what he knelt for I am in support of (Police brutality)."
"No, I respectfully believe your mistaken in that broad generalization respectfully MY TAKE, many people believe in God of all political persuasions crossing all racial and sexual orientations. The church has long been the bedrock in the Black communities, especially in the Civil Rights era, people of all political parties share a belief in God, and there are many churches with Gay ministers and parishioners today some doing gay marriages in their belief in God as well, even with regard to Biblical admonitions against such. 



As far as the personal insult MY TAKE, I don't give rise to such when issued, nor respond in kind,  never have. I think they reflect more on the author who employs such when in the public forums of discussion, so I refrain from doing so. But you welcome to do so all the same in the vain of uncensored speech, which I firmly believe in. 


Have a great day respectfully!"
Public servants can be scary and Honolulu is no exception. Some use violence and others rip off your money (Caldwell).  Best to obey and if and take up your issues with the venues available.  And all the silly black wanabees using violence should go to jail.

"You have a better level of experience than some, but you are still not black nor have you lived in black neighborhood.   My relations were mostly assoicated with my education.  These were most guys recruited in St. Louis, Kansas City and amazingly several from New York.  They had been in street violence, some rough neighborhoods.  I also stayed a week in a St Louis projects area, there only by permission of local gang agreement through a church in that interacted with my college professor.. Gunshots heard at night were common.   But that was 1975 and things change.   It was a short experience a long time ago.

So anyway, what did you learn from those black guys in the army."
"Old Soul, you must have a very short memory. Maybe you should lay off the ganja. Besides calling half of Trump supporters deplorable, you may (or may not) remember that she also called black youth ""super predators"". Other scandals attributed to both Bill and Hillary include Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Hillary's treatment of all Bill's sexual assault victims, Filegate, Benghazi, Clinton Foundation misuses, and her private email server. The only reason they got away with it is due to their elite status and connections. Who knows what else they've gotten away with.

One more thing I almost forgot to mention: the Clinton's involvement in the DNC conspiracy to deny Bernie Sanders the Democratic nomination."
How is the President encouraging police to shoot and kill black who are unarmed?

"Heres an Idea.  Why don't the broncos spend their game plan working on how to best protest on the sidelines.  It worked out really well for the Raiders, Steelers and Broncos last week.  How about something even more exotic. Lets be sure to practice all those special end zone dances on the occassional chance you actually score a TD.  Sad.  Our country is so divided and now the one thing that gives us a ray of hope is being riped apart by a bunch of millionaire NFL players who think that the Police actually lay awake at night trying to figure out how to kill more black men.

But hey.  I say go for it.  Lets really make a stand.  Lets just not play the game. Lets show America.  Cancel the NFL.  I wont miss it."
What everyone must relalize here is everyone has the same rights and this is no different than black or women or gay or what ever marches.

We tend to blame foreign governments, foreign people or others within ourselves forgetting that the enemy is ourselves. We do not have a government but a bunch of looters who are after their own interest not serving the Nation. Our Mozambiquean Neighbors have a saying or word ""POVO"" meaning a person who believes anything. Our Nation believes in anything without putting it to test and that is the reason we are where we are and it is going to be far worse unless the Almighty God intervenes.

And, THANK GOD their lawyers pushed for a jury trial.  The Feds screwed themselves all over on this one and they knew it."
"Pretty sad when all the news is gay bathrooms, black lives, racism and cleansing of history as we know/knew it. I can't wait till the Polish people and the Hispanics jump on the wagon.

Nope, it's just all hunky dory."
"`Odd that the article fails to mention the reason Chad pulled their troops out.

"Maralyn Kurshals  I wasn't a great fan of Trump, but he is now POTUS and we must come together to fix our economic, social, and political problems.  Your comments about PP, Meals on Wheels, and other stuff are just Democrat/Left talking points.  However, Trump's ""moral conscience"" is exactly what prompted the retaliation for Assad's use of chemical weapons to kill men, women, and children in his own country.  In fact, Trump simply enforced the red line drawn by Obama which Obama was too weak to enforce.   Perhaps this explains why you last paragraph shifted to comment on former President Obama.  Surely you know by now that it is not political correct to attack our first half-Black American president.   Thankfully, that era will not only pass; it has already passed."
This clown likes the obama's? Both michelle and barak are clowns and only are in power because of dark skin - oprah acted like a fool when obama got in - she's a racist
"When Lyles came in to start the 8th, and EVERY Rockies fan on the planet was at the very LEAST ""puckering up"" a bit, and at the very most, throwing a brick through their TV set, Goodman said that Black REALLY wanted to stay away from Holland today, because he had pitched a LOT earlier in the week. His velocity was down in his last game, and even though he had yesterday off, he'd thrown over twenty pitches in each of the last two games before that, compounded by the little bit of bad luck on the timing, because he brought him in in a NON-save opportunity for only the 3rd time on Wednesday, because he hadn't been getting ENOUGH work. So it sounds like Black made it clear that that he was REALLY hoping to stay away from him today, knowing that if he COULD get through today w/out using him, w/the off day tomorrow, he'll end up w/three full days of rest if we need him to go on Tuesday."
"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism Something else to consider, many of the comments here seem to follow this. If you admit you're a racist it is easier to change it, assuming you want to change. The problems in the black community are the problems of all americans. United we stand and divided we fall, something to think about."
What these femanazis fail to realize is that President Trump has hired and cut paychecks to more women blacks latinos gays lesbians transgenders and muslims than all previous presidents combined.
No BIGOTS need apply. Your defending bigotry by saying it is backed by religious beliefs does not differ in any way from racists who refused to serve blacks and said it was because of their religious beliefs.

"<<the lie is still perpetuated and perpetrated on the American public>>

Is it? I'm not aware of that.

<<The police officer who shot Scott in the back should receive the death penalty.>>

He accepted a plea bargain from the feds and the state murder charge against him was dropped.

Meanwhile, could you be more condescending? One wonders if you ever encounter black people. They're actually fully capable of grasping where government funding comes from. ""Don't know any better."" You have no idea what you're talking about.

If it's any consolation the poor black people I'm aware of who live in subsidized housing and visit food banks, etc., lead extremely stressful lives and deal with frequent humiliations because of their race and poverty (yet are the first to praise God; go figure). But I guess that's not good enough to satisfy your mysterious sense of injury."

"Police have an extremely well documented and historically verified pattern of abuse and bigotry towards blacks, gays and women.  The massive class action lawsuit against the RCMP being just one ongoing example to this day.

Although this move by pride Toronto is understandable, it's not inclusive.  But until police can reinvent themselves as trusted partners and not oppressors, they will continue to be shunned in public participation events."
"(b) it is not used as a basis to scam extra money out of government programs. The problem is, that is exactly what could happen. I remember someone being interviewed on the radio regarding this issue a couple of years ago and the guest  who had studied polygamy said that in some African tribes some men have 20 wives.

"This fine article is a cautionary tale about the dangers of jumping to conclusions. First, officer Coleman did in his investigation, then the media in their reporting of the aftermath of that failure.

In the dumbed-down America of the 21st century we want our news succinct and simple, with easy to spot heroes and villains that reinforce our biases. Black drug users, racist Texas towns -- those are things we can get our heads around.

Complexity, on the other hand, just harshes our mellow."
"I wonder how many of BLM are actually LGBTQ. Gay Pride has worked hard to gain respect and validation within society, to the point where LGBTQ members of the police, like LGBTQ members of every other section of society, feel that they have a place within the community. BLM, on the other hand, have had difficulty getting their message across. Canadians just do not believe that their police officers are trigger-happy racists randomly killing blacks. So their strategy is to use Gay Pride to validate and promote their views. 

Annual General meetings are always at risk for takeovers by small groups of determined individuals. The answer, if Gay Pride does not want to be split into a hundred feuding pieces, is to arrange a special meeting and make sure that there are enough LGBTQ members from all parts of society to reverse this divisive decision."

Trump did not say anything against gay marriage.  In fact, he did say he ""is fine with it.""   He has said *nothing* opposing gays or lesbians.  He said the gay marriage issue is ""settled,"" meaning he does not oppose it.

"You ask an interesting question.  May I simply suggest that not all human behavior is rational; in fact, as I look around at what we do to each other and to the earth, sometimes I think we're more likely to behavior in irrational fashion.  ...and, yes, I consider supporting that a man who, all his life, has demonstrated the moral values and emotional instability of Donald Trump, to be irrational. 

After the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King, inner city Blacks in LA burned their own neighborhoods and looted and destroyed businesses owned in many cases by other African Americans.  In my opinion, their""blind anger"" fueled irrational behavior.  Our history, as the history of all nations, is ripe with examples of various types of irrational ""mob"" behavior.  

IMO, the support of Donald Trump as a Presidential candidate reflects a widespread disillusion with the ""status quo"" in peoples' lives.  It seems based on the belief that America is ""going to hell in a handbasket""  (con.)"

"Do we screen these recruits to see if we're getting 'gypsy cops'?  

Is that process open and public?

The phrase entered public parlance after the infamous Tulia drug stings, where itinerant lawman Tom Coleman allegedly set up innocent people, most of them black, as part of a long-term undercover operation. 











Several other high-profile cases in states including Texas and Alaska involved officers who served with adversity in close to 20 agencies in 15 years or less, yet they continued to evade administrative action as they went from agency to agency, sometimes serving as little as 30 days at one department, despite blatant misconduct and compelling signs of unsuitability to serve as peace officers.

Well?  What are we doing about it?"
"""Let's be honest. This election exposed the ugly under belly of American bigotry and widespread ignorance.""  It did, indeed, by being a mirror to some 600 cruisers and millions of like-minded travelers who simply don't get that the country that was so ""progressive"" as to elect a black man twice could suddenly turn so ""crass"" and ""racist.""  Imagine the bubble-headed hubris it takes to say that ""most of the so-called ""rural"" voters were inclined from the very beginning to elect anyone with a Republican label. Look at a county by county mapping of the vote and see the overwhelming crassness of small town voters. I am sickened.""  Well, are you, now?  A little too learned, too sophisticated for small town, are you?

Well, I'm no bumpkin, Mr. Evans, and I detest racism.  I also detest Trump.  I voted for him --- as did most of those who voted for him --- as the lesser of two evils.  Want to know why Clinton lost?  Look no farther than the last few lines of your post."

"Mental illness is no joke, I agree. But at the same time why did you choose to bring racism into play?  Musician humor and black humor are two totally different entities.  Like I said you need to lighten up.  The kids I deal with do better with humor than with trying to make them focus on what their minds have no concept of.  I deal with kids and have autistic kids in my family, and humor gets through to them a lot better than trying to explain what isn't important to them.  Being safe and secure is how  I choose to focus, not chastising."

The Declaration of Independence is ""not"" the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.  The intent of all of these people and groups is to destroy the laws under our Constitution to be replaced by those with enough arms to take it all away from other people.  They are all just traitors, and in too many cases mentally deranged."

"I didn't say I haven't heard of them support the BLM.  I said I haven't heard them say they support the BLM-associated violence.  I also haven't heard or read that the BLM has as policy support of violence. Yes, I've seen it in marches they were in, but I'm not sure where the BLM stands related to that.  

I'm believe all lives matter.  I get the reason why black people are focused on their race, and that they want the focus on issues they believe directed towards them.  There are a myriad of reasons why that seems so.  I'd also like to see more ownership of their issues with law enforcement by them, too.  Sure, there is racism and bad cops, but that's not 100% the reason why there are so many problems between cops and officers.  We can sure play the victim very well, can't we?

"Qatar is the key US ally in the Arabian Peninsula & the US has a major base there on which it relies for much of its efforts against ISIL & other like-minded Sunni fundamentalist factions in Syria/Iraq. Turkey, a NATO ally of the US & the US's somewhat unreliable ally on the Syria/Iraq scene, also supports Qatar. Egypt (its domestic stability being key to US regional policy) relies significantly on the remittances by Egyptian nationals who work in Qatar.

It is true that, while Qatar in several ways plays a modernizing & moderating role in the region, it also serves unofficially as a conduit for funds for ISI, but so does Saudi Arabia and its allies in making these demands.

The Saudis made these demands shortly after Trump's visit & the US remains very silent throughout.

Why shouldn't we see all this together as further evidence of confusion & incoherence to a dangerous & destabilizing extent in US Middle East policy, especially whenever Trump becomes directly involved?"

"""scientists still exclude the possibility of Mind and Choice occurring at the molecular level before sentient life existed.""

That's not how science works. Describe the experiment or observation that would test this notion and then it can become a scientific issue.

Not all scientists are atheists, so it's an irrelevant ad hominem.  No one has ever proposed that it ""just happened"". The entire point of this line of research is to determine how life began. There is no assumption that it ""just happened"". 

""Do jigsaw puzzles EVER assemble themselves?""

It hasn't been observed, but in an infinite universe the odds that it happened at least once could be more favourable than you think. In any case, this is the problem of induction that all science faces. No matter how many observations you make, a black swan event is always possible. So scientists don't believe anything with 100% conviction. The just support a given explanation with varying levels of confidence."
"All of that and blacks are still poor, illicit drugs are everywhere, health insurance premiums have sky rocketed, school graduation rates continue to decline as do test scores, our country is respected less than ever and the ME remains a war torn sh*thole.

A nut job? Now that's  the pot calling the kettle black .
There is also the fact that the black population in inner cities didn't feel Mr. Obama had really helped them.  The NYT ran an interview from Detroit where many African Americans said they felt let down so didn't bother to vote.  You can't take someone's vote for granted.
"Partisan voters,  what a joke you are trying to make,  looking at the videos most are black ,  Latino, or younger women, and most likely on some welfare program or another,  the organizers are most likely paid by the left,  Sharpton and the like,  they get more news coverage if the get violent and destroy property, shooting them is a little strong but if you just shot one or two of the thugs that are destroying other peoples property or attacking police it would probably discourage the paid protesters."
"Yeah it's ""black privilege""  to drive a car and worry that the police will racially profile you. It's ""black privilege"" to have lived as a second class citizen.

"2/2
The area is the center of the Russian Black Sea fleet based in Sevastopol. Following Ukrainian independence there were unsuccessful attempts at Ukrainianization. The Russian society in general and even some government officials never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and regarded the separation from the homeland as temporary. Kiev's disregard of the region exacerbated that impression.

The  Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) rather than the Kyivan Patriarchate was the dominant church.

In the six years prior to the Russian annexation the American administration did nothing to prepare for what happened. During the 2012 debate with Romney the President Barack Obama laughed at the idea Russia posed any threat. He also promised then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ""more flexibility"" after the election. They believed him.

"Disproportionately:

Blacks committed about 55% of the murders, despite making up only 13% of the population.  Disproportionately.

Blacks were responsible 88% of the time, when another black person was murdered, despite making up only 13% of the population.  Disproportionately.

30% of all criminal arrests are of blacks, despite making up only 13% of the population. Disproportionately.

40% of the time that a police officer is murdered, it is by a black male, despite making up only 7% of the population.  Disproportionately.
Source: FBI Expanded Homicide Tables #3 and 6, and others.

Correlation is not causation.  Being black does not cause you to commit crimes.

However, if you are DISPROPORTIONATELY involved in a higher number of police ""criminal interactions/interdictions"", you might get shot at a DISPROPORTIONATELY higher rate (26%).

I know.  Big Numbers.  They mean things."

So, who is being condescending now?
Maybe all black people can reach their own opinions, hmmm? Not just the ones you agree with?
You loathe being lumped in with other groups, but you are okay lumping all liberals together and making assumptions about all of them."
"This relatively ""new phenomenon"" where NFL players throughout the country (and some others) chose to ""kneel"" and perhaps ""bow their heads"" during the National Anthem could be a questionable expression of their ""displeasure"" to ""contempt"" for the United States and its Anthem.....and perhaps President Trump.
-
And  it could be that some joined the ""knelling"" to also express their reverence for a much Higher Power (God) since ""kneeling and bowing one's head"" is a ""traditional"" way of showing such reverence to God.

Think of the irony if Blacks, Southern Confederates, the Religious Right, and others all - all - become ""united"" in showing their ""displeasure"" of the United States.....for entirely different reasons."
"That xenophobic, theocratic weasel, Kansas Secretary of State, Kris Kobach, wants a lot more than your registration info. He wants to know about any criminal convictions you may have.

Now when I call my (ex-NBA) bank to get my balance, or my clinic to find out the results of blood tests, or when I call my AK Air credit card folks, they want the last four digits of my social security #. Do you want Kris Kobach and the Russian hackers to have that? He wants this to supposedly prevent voting fraud, but he's  deliberately kept tens of thousands of American citizens from voting. Kobach went to Arizona and North Carolina and Wisconsin, to keep black and brown and poor people, and students and WOMEN from voting. Bernie did get shafted, thanks to the DNC, but I can't imagine that Bernie would want these creatures to have the data they're demanding!"

"Provided access to the right medical training, Mr. Riek should be able to continue his compassionate medical work and interest.  Have you ever heard of Vivien Thomas?  Vivien Thomas was a black man who paved the way for open heart surgery.  Vivien was barred from earning his medical degree back in the 1930s because he was black and back then universities didn't recognize minority students.  Vivien started out working at the prestigious Johns Hopkins University clean dog kennels for Dr. Alfred Blalock who was a medical researcher and surgeon.  Blalock was credited with introducing the groundbreaking Blue Baby lung surgery, which led into open heart surgery.  Few people are even aware that it was a black man that first introduced open heart surgery.  Ageism will play a factor in Mr. Riek's ability to work in the medical field.  By the way, Raven, who gave you the authority to determine someone else's qualifications.  Mr. Riek likely have far more advanced skills than you do.  Right?"
"You misread what I said. It isn't the act of disobeying that is in question. It is the act of doing something in a provocative manner while disobeying. If the man with his hands up simply refused to sit down, he wouldn't have been shot. The issue was he had his hands up and was refusing to stop what he was doing. The real question in this one will be if he was reaching into the window. If he refused to stop while having his hands up and reached into his window, then yes, he deserved what he got. If the window was up and he simply leaned against the car, then no, he shouldn't have been. Two officers reacted in the exact same way at the exact same time, leading me to believe the window was down and he was reaching for something. Though that is speculation on my part. 

I don't believe there is a war on black people and that police are intentionally shooting black people. That is nonsense. If he would've stopped when ordered to, the situation wouldn't have escalated to that point. Period."

Last I checked, a significant amount of our fruits and veggies is now imported from Mexico, Chile, Australia, etc and the rest that's grown here is done mostly via automation and large industrial machines requiring few humans for manual hard labor. BTW, there are only an estimated 30,000 illegal workers in the entire farming community. A far cry from the 40+ million illegals that reside here and the jobs they stole from Americans.

Isn't it obvious that this was meant as a pun [albeit a bad one]  that played off Segal's title as a 'master' of the college? It would apply to anyone, regardless of colour.

Using the ""f"" word was inappropriate & made him look bad & I think he made a threat if he was touched. Bishop seemed like a nice guy. He doesn't look like a punk or bad boy type. I don't see this as a racist issue. I do see it as an issue that some people don't like rap music & stereotyped this particular group. He did embarrass himself when he used the ""n"" word. Also the fact that he is running his mouth on & on has resulted in him saying some things that put him in a bad light. The whole situation was handled very poorly in my opinion. If it had been a racist issue then why was the other black woman performer not asked to leave. The situation is certainly not worth having a race riot. If I were him I'd  hire a lawyer."

No.  The history of blacks in America is horrifying and not really anything close to what is going on now.  However, can you name me another point in American history when a specific subgroup of people were being denied services based on things like ""religion"" or beliefs that was not later determined to be unjust?"

"I do not condone what Pillar said but Kelly saying Pillar got preferential treatment compared to Escobar because Pillar is a better player is incorrect.  Both unfortunately used homophobic slurs however Pillar said it out of anger in the spur of the moment, Escobar had obviously thought about his word as he was writing the slur in his eye black and therefore a deliberate thought out action.  Typical Kelley, overreacting.  However, if it is known the pitcher is a homosexual that changes the matter in my opinion.  Then I would have suspended Pillar for a month.  Also Kelley is wrong when he says Pillar should have included the term in his apology."

"Comments sections are great for the same reason Trump is great: they shine a  light on the squalid little black heart of the self-styled ""conservative"" movement and display how vapid and morally and intellectually empty its true believers truly are. 

In this thread, observe the common rhetorical conservative ""tactic"" of 1) making a race-baiting comment; 2) when called out for said race-baiting comment, trying to turn the tables to say ""you're really the racist! You brought race into this!"" These people who do this are unable to help themselves; they were raised on a steady diet of resentment  and think poking fun at the physical characteristics and ancestry of other people is the height of wit. 

They know they're being left behind by a world that finds them as distasteful and ignorant as the people who threw rocks at little black girls getting off school buses in the 50s.  Unable to adjust, they resent those who did. So they vent here. The dogs bark but the caravans move on."

"@jerry69, here is some spin from an 1855 letter of Abraham Lincoln's:

“As a nation, we began by declaring that ‘all men are created equal.’ We now practically read it ‘all men are created equal, except negroes.’ When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ‘all men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.’ When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty—to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.”

Know-Nothings refers to the American Party, which didn't want Irish Catholics fleeing the potato famine to enter the country.  People thought women were held against their will in Catholic convents and that priests systematically raped nuns and then strangled any children born as a result of their union.

See the comparison?"
"I'm not sure. Perhaps the simplest would be for the Chinese to convince Kim to step down, or convince his generals to a quiet coup. Black ops to eliminate their nuclear/ballistic capability. Open warfare would not be a good option, even with international consent. 
But a more likely scenario is that Kim does something stupid like cross into ROK or land a missle in Japan or Guam, then we flatten him with shock & awe. Best to ignore him until then (i.e. Don't grant consessions. He'll up the ante & ask for more.).  But make very clear to China & the rest of the world what will happen if/when he crosses that line. It cannot be Pres. Obama's Red Line for Syria."
"Standing with your hand over your heart is respect. Kneeling and shoving a Black Power fist in the air is disrespecting the flag, and country. In addition the only thing that will be accomplished is possibly even less people with be sympathetic to your cause. Based on your disrespectful actions to the flag and country some might even believe you deserve what you say is happening."
"Highly unequal. Like so many things in South Africa: income, opportunity, schooling, health, policing, land ownership... ect. While you can label BEE all you like the simple fact is that the constitution allows this prejudice to correct the system, to make it more equal, and it is indeed an irony but perhaps predictable that it takes this guise. It is however a prejudice that many argue is absolutely necessary and so far has been conducted by governmental discretion.

Attacks on this mechanism that claim it is based on race and hence wrong fail because that is not the premise; there was literal harm done to millions of South Africans that irrespective of their skin colour needs to be redressed.  The fact that they were black, has made it easier to regulate, but in essence is not necessary.  Rationality and cost effectiveness are still requirements though. 

 While I strongly believe that race is a fiction with no basis in reality, racism was/is unfortunately very much a reality."

"Wow, I just got one STRANGE warning from the ""Civil Comments"" system.

Up popped one of the posts I was supposed to assess for suitability.

The post said something like this:

""Islam as described in the Koran can never be satisfied until Islam has overtaken infidel beliefs worldwide - as described in the Koran it is an expansionist ideology that requires preeminent status and so you might as well start learning more about its features sooner rather than later"".

Well, I voted that the post was okay and was civil, and WHAM!, my whole webpage went black and these big words in an angry-looking red font came up saying something like ""WARNING: YOU HAVE FAILED TO REJECT A POST THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE REJECTED, YOU MUST EMPLOY MORE SCRUTINY AND SINCERITY IN YOUR ASSESSMENT EFFORTS"".

Um, hello?

Seriously, hello?

How was the guy's post uncivil? For crying out loud, I could provide quotes by Winston Churchill that were a LOT more harsh on Islam than that post! Shall we ban Churchill quotes?"
"It's ""Boipatong"" and ""apologize."" But be that as it may, another fine piece of manufactured leftard outrage. But I do have a solution for you: given that you are practically insanely outraged over apartheid (also just 1 p), why don't you sell all your assets and hand over the proceeds to black people, to show us how really, truly,  f...king sorry you are (wth apologies to Monty Python?) This includes, of course, the PC on which you so regularly spew your brain-dead bilge. That way, not only will some apartheid victims benefit, but we will all also be spared from having to read your nonsensical whingeing."

And where was the psychologist who could have prevented the Roseburg murderers' rampage or the Aurora Colorado theater murderer?  I am much more concerned about the  the psychiatric and psychological industry's complicity in the mass shooting cases than I am the 'negligence' of firearm owning parents.  Your 'teenager gun deaths' is a red herring when you factor in the thousands of those which are Black and Hispanic gang-related drug dealing deaths, not mislaid parental firearms."
"Let's use this analogy:

There is a baker who is a Black Orthodox Jew. Three customers (a Neo-Nazi, a KKK, and a gay person) come in, separately, and they select items he has for sale and he rings up their individual purchases. 
-
Is there any form of discrimination there? No.
-
The next day, those same three customers return, separately, and they each ask the Black Jewish baker to decorate a cake they want to buy. The Neo-Nazi wants a cake decorated with swastikas and a picture of Hitler; the KKK wants the cake decorated showing a man being lynched; the gay person wants a same-sex wedding cake. He respectfully declines all three requests.
-
Is there any form of discrimination there, and if so, exactly what is being discriminated against?
-
""Yes,"" there might to some sort of ""discrimination""....but what is being ""discriminated"" is the ""artwork"" he is being asked to create with his artistic talents.
-
He cannot discriminate against ""people,"" but ""offensive artwork"" is not ""people."""

"One of Obama's major contributions to America has been to make it so that, for about ten years, African American kids have grown up seeing a black President, seeing a black guy who made it to the top office of the land.

That contribution alone is more valuable to the American fabric than any single act of most presidents of the past half century."
"I admit, I could be wrong, he may not have been an immigrant. In my city, there are a large number of Hispanic immigrants. They dress similar and groom similar and drive similar dilapidated vehicles. They gather at home depot parking lots waiting for job opportunities. If you think I am a racist by such statements you are wrong - it is simply an observation.

(I very much admire people who work hard in spite of tough living conditions)

Many here, have had a knee-jerk PC reaction and have already labeled me a hateful racist! Ha!
That would explain why most of my friends, since kindergarten where either black or Hispanic!!

 In pointing out my possible error in judgment - they have all judged me in error - with much animosity and condescension I might add, - which I never intended for the possible 'immigrant' driver who sped past the school children getting off the bus.

In JUDGING ME - you miss my original point - the importance of knowing the language and laws of the place you live."
"I've been trying my best to keep this civil.
But there you go calling me, not smart, because I don't see it the way you do.  BTW....if your point is true about ""who you are"" you wouldn't have people who gave up the gay lifestyle.  There are many documented proof of people who gave up the gay lifestyle freely....just like people I know who gave up drugs, affairs, stealing...etc.  Unlike the true civil rights issues of African Americans, Native Americans, Hawaiians, Japanese internments, Jews....the list goes on."

"I wanted to hear your responses. I'm not defending any of O'Reilly's actions, he must deal with it. What I find interesting is that where are all your voices when the Black caucus stood on the steps of  The Capital and stated ""hands up, don't shoot"".  They knew it was a lie that they wanted to be true. The result, how much destruction and lives have been lost from this totally perverted action. MSNBC totally supported the actions of the Black caucus and others. That's a problem.  I'm not justifying O'Reilly's actions in his personal life or suggesting a moral equivalency with the actions of the the MSM, but there's something wrong when O'Rielly's personal life causes and outrage, but we hear little about the actions of Black Lives Matter and the  MSM enablers.  We could also discuss the carnage as a result of  ISIS, remember, the ""JV team""? There are many important issues in the world, but O'Reilly's personal life isn't exactly on top. The real goal is the remove him from TV."

So Obama looked like the opposite of Bush and people went that way.  The only problem is the far left is not a great place to be either.  People had 8 years to forget about Bush and we are headed back to the far right.  Maybe someday we'll find middle ground.  Groups like the Tea Party, Occupy ?, Black lives matter are a big part of the problem."

C) Working class = who knows? maybe 50%

"The U.S. doesn't claim to be the most virtuous country in the world, that would be Canada. 
How would anyone know what atrocities have been committed against blacks in Canada?  The news of today is heavily censored in Canada to keep the bad stuff out. Do you seriously think you're going to hear about past unpleasant events? Do you think the detainee scandal will be in Canadian history text books?
Blacks in the U.S. at 13% of the population are empowered while in Canada they are beholding to the majority and evidently that's not working out too well.
If you read the article in the G&M on the topic, or the actual UN report, you will see that mistreatment of blacks in the U.S. isn't considered a plus for Canada. In fact, the report is about Canada and it takes all the self-serving flattery you heap on yourselves and blows it apart."
"Who said ""What difference does it make?"" She reported it and that's what matters. Retaliation against reporters of a crime is a crime. Recently, when I called 9-1-1 to report stalking about a female stalking me in my numerically-assigned parking space, I was mocked by the male 9-1-1 operator when he asked me ""Are you the one stalking her?"" I felt shunned from calling 9-1-1. To make the long story short, I reported the unsafe driver online at www.reportdangerousdrivers.com
If you don't know the difference between Reserved Parking and Visitor Parking signs you are obviously an impaired driver and need attention. 
Alaska Code Section 11.41.260 & .270 clearly define Stalking; therefore, I understand repeated acts of unwanted contact at my residence including my paid parking space being used illegally without my consent by the Stalker is a crime and it was reported. His word over hers is a familiar scenario with evidence omitted. If serious, they could subpoena duces tecum phone records"
Good for the IRR. Maybe those fascist middle class UCT black students - especially that idiotic one with the 'Decolonised Science' rubbish - might actually learn something from this.

"Soaring addiction, overdoses, hundreds dead, entire neighborhoods devolving into animals, skyrocketing theft, burglary, car theft, shoplifting, property crime overrunning whatever law enforcement MIGHT exist, all of that fueling the black market in stolen goods, or stolen property used to barter for more drugs, which just pours more gas on the flames eating the hearts out of communities. The heroin junkies and methheads ramp up the theft and other crimes across the board for more dope to shoot up with and these career politicians pass laws to feather their own nest more efficiently, sneaking subtle legal maneuvers through the (Con)gress to make it easier for Big Pharma to peddle death in a pill, hooking thousands upon thousands on opioids that they eventually can't get for whatever reason, so they turn to heroin and meth.

Damn these people. These politicians deserve a deep, dank hole with no windows for the rest of their lives."
"Dale, the premise of your letter is so absurd that it appeals only to those of limited capacity to think and reason.  To you, Black lives clearly do NOT matter, which is the crux of the problem.  I am sick of watching cowardly police officers escalating situations and instead of trying to calm a situation down, quickly resorting to deadly force, often expressing enjoyment while doing so.   Your view is representative of ingrained racial fear and hatred, fueled by the belief that Mr. Obama is a secret Muslim born in Kenya, and that that racism was never a problem in America problem until Obama was elected.   Any intelligent person would be embarrassed and ashamed of publishing the views expressed in your letter.  Deplorable."

And all the while being hated because he's Black. I rise in his honor."
"No problem for FELONS to get firearm's.

"The real world.  Hmmm.  You say the marketplace of ideas is ""the real world,"" and you imply it is therefore true.  Well, the ""real world"" South until 50 years ago was full of lynchings.  The real world of some Muslim countries allows the stoning of gays, even today.  Why?  Because in their marketplace of ideas, those ideas are the most popular.  Is it true that blacks should be lynched?  That gays should be stoned?  So there you have it:  The marketplace of ideas --- like any marketplace --- measures popularity, not truth."

New York - liberal and ignorant... 'Current' numbers have Hillary ahead in Popular vote by less than 50K votes - a joke at best...

"Is this sarcasm? If not then wow, I mean you are defending a symbol of female oppression that is only common in countries where Canada's liberal values are non-existent: gender equality, freedom of association (people are killed for apostasy and blasphemy), LGBT rights, and freedom of expression (people are lynched for religious satire and comedy). The niqab is synonymous with social regression and a lack of fundamental rights Canadians take for granted. It's not a coincidence that in every single country where the niqab is common that women are subjugated as second class citizens (often under the threat of violence). There is rich irony in defending the niqab while simultaneously raising concerns about homophobia and anti-semitism as wherever the niqab is common, the LGBT community face the death penalty for being outed and hostility towards Jews is a badge of honour. 
The niqab is synonymous with social regression, division, and community segregation, without exception."

"We have seen, time and again, that the government only listens to the voice of violence. It takes serious disruption to get their heads out of the trough long enough to see the unhappiness. I feel for the current mayor because he is reaping the whirlwind the ANC sowed. We all know that salvation for the South African economy lies in SMME business development, but all the initiatives from government - like the Small Business Development Department are only interested in helping BLACK entrepreneurs, prey to the same racism as the past. So many entrepreneurs are leaving SA because they are the wrong colour and get the message that there is no future for them here because of the actions of others decades and centuries ago. Ironically the best black graduates also leave these shores. Each that goes takes a fragment of the hope for jobs for the people in these backwaters of hopelessness. It is high tragedy."
"It is shocking how Ismaili spokesmen have become apologists for Islamist terror. One would think that an Islamic sect that had know persecution and terror at the hands of the theocrats and imams who today direct mayhem at the West, would be the first to set distance between themselves and the holy killers, but that has not happened. Instead we get rationalizations and minimization of the issue. 
My take is that their position in the wider Muslim Ummah is too marginal for them to stand up and speak without fear of fatwa and persecution, from Saudi or Pakistan based Islamic teachers and followers.
This self censorship makes many Ismailis poor advisers for non-Muslims who wish to understand the challenges of Islamism, Wahabbism and Jihadi violence for our nations future. You want to understand that, talk to a Salafi - there you will learn."

You are a fascist.  You are an Old South Rebel preferring the Stars and Bars to the Stars and Stripes.  Totalitarianism comes in many forms, but, like your base ideology, dedicated to the control over others for self satisfaction through assault, torture, and murder.

"It seems that Dicks daughter is also dick. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) came out in strong support of a draft executive order that suggested President Donald Trump would re-examine the use of enhanced interrogation techniques and CIA black sites that were banned under the Obama administration.

""I would support very much the idea that we're going to review and that's what the executive order does. I think that it's been clear, certainly since we stopped the enhanced interrogation program, we're not even in a position any more, frankly, where we're very often capturing people. We have nothing to do with people when we do capture them,"" Cheney said.

"You are assuming the boy would have screamed when seeing a dark skinned person.  The post talks about someone in a big black garment, covered from head to toe, without anyone in the elevator being able to see its face.  People dress up in similar fashions at Halloween to get a frightened response from others.  The image of something hooded black without a face showing has always denoted something dark in the Western culture, even the Devil and the henchmen.  Jung would have called it a symbol of evil, of darkness.  
You are missing the point.  Most of us fear that which we do not know, and that which we are kept from knowing.  
There was a time when we used to see women in clear blue burkas in
footage that reached us from Afghanistan.  Somehow that felt very different from the black outfits we see today.  Still, in all instances the covering of a face should not have a place in our open society."

Also, to clarify, all Trump supporters are deplorable, not half. Clinton was mistaken if she said only half were deplorable. So I don't agree with her on that."
"I'm no great fan of Trump for POTUS but, if it's him or Hillary, I'll vote for him over a lying, conniving, incompetent  ""what difference does it make"" Hillary.  Trump has shot himself in the foot more than once, but I'm fed up with top-feeders like The Clintons who think it's their turn because they've been in the game a long time and/or are the desirable race/gender for another First (Black, Female, ,etc.) President-thing.  The main reason Trump gets terrible press is the terrible press.  They forgive or overlook Hillary and other Democrats' every flaw (yes, they do have huge flaws), and nitpick ad nauseum everything Trump does--or any other Republican.   Of course, we know the Democrat Monarchy will always win in provincial, dysfunctional Hawaii, so there's almost no point in someone like me voting.

Despite their money and inroads they are roundly despised by the people who live there.  They've poured in money and manpower to acquire mines to supply the minerals and ores for their products and their own workers, not the professionals necessary to liaise with the locals but the actual labour at the coalface. They've left little benefit for the people and economies of Africa construction was for their benefit not that of the Africans. No legacy and thoroughly disliked."

Sure, here let students protest, make a noise ......... but not through burning, destruction, trampling the rights of others, breaking and looting, piles of shit on the floor. Please, promote a reasoned argument and deliver it with intellectual force.

That is not happening here. This arrogant, naive, destructive, backward, savage ill - informed performance,  is not acceptable in civilised societies. 

I don't expect any positive input from our failed government. But the silence from black society at large?Are they unaware of the ammunition given to those with negative racist attitudes? Are they not aware of the massive damage done to what is now their society?"

"Gee, one would think there are gay police officers in Toronto. In fact, we know that there are gay police officers in the Toronto Police Service. But, special interest groups like black lives matter count more, eh? BLM are bullies, plain and simple.  And Pride Toronto should be ashamed of themselves for caving."
"Here is another black history moment, did you know that American Indians owned thousands of black slaves, I wonder if allie's  indian  side of her family owned slaves."
"So the protestors are racist,  how,  exactly?

Its sad you're so triggered by the horrid injustice of hearing a black man's opinion."
Because a birth certificate was demanded for the very first time when an African American ran for president.  That assumption is pure and simple racism.
"Play back all of the RNC video sessions, Gegonos, and see if you can actually count how many black faces you can find in any of the videos.  The attendance by blacks was so sparse that I had a good laugh."
"And he is gone and will kill no one else ever again.  

Chicago, now, will continue to have blacks killing blacks and killing more blacks and killing, etc.....just as they have for decades.  

And mostly to protect drug turf, and 'protection' turf, and prostitution turf from other gang bangers to make money."
"1. The Police Union is lying. LGBTQ police continue to be welcome to participate in the parade, just not in uniform.

2. The police demonstrate why Black Lives Matter was right. The police didn't get their way, so they try to destroy the parade.

Police, time to suck it up and back off. It was oppressive and violent policing that started the parade in the first place."
Yawn. You think Hillary Clinton isn't racist? If you do you are a fool. She accepted a $20k check from the KKK for her campaign. She was caught on video making a racist comment about Mexicans. She went to a college costume party in black face. Get your head out of the sand! Mr. Trump is not racist. That is liberal lies!
"As with most discussions of this issue of bending the knee, this article obscures the reason why Colin Kaepernick bent the knee in the first place. The US is undergoing an epidemic of police violence against African Americans in particular, but by no means limited to them. The fact is, every African American male, rich or poor, is vulnerable to being pulled over by police for the most trivial reasons and then quite possibly being shot to death. When that issue is resolved it will be appropriate to talk about what type of protest is acceptable, but not before."
"If Mexicans are deported, who will pick the fruits and vegetables, or do all that low wage service work? ?  African Americans? Millennials?"
"""It seems now that if a black is shot and killed by police it brings immediate protesting and usually some level of rioting""

I think you're confusing news coverage with reality. About 200 blacks have been killed by police so far in 2016. There haven't been 200 protests or rioting."
"""Eugenics"" ? "" Racists"" ""Sexism""  Then we in Oregon must especially denigrate Margaret Sanger,  the founder of Planned Parenthood, for her part in founding Oregon's State Hospital-run Oregon State Board of Eugenics requiring forced sterilization of thousands of women and who, along with W.E.B. DuBois proposed the Negro Project to sterilize young black girls to reduce negro poverty.

""Margaret Sanger aligned herself with the eugenicists whose ideology prevailed in the early 20th century. Eugenicists strongly espoused racial supremacy and “purity,” particularly of the “Aryan” race. Eugenicists hoped to purify the bloodlines and improve the race by encouraging the “fit” to reproduce and the “unfit” to restrict their reproduction. They sought to contain the “inferior” races through segregation, sterilization, birth control and abortion.""

Why cherry pick? Why not help all the gay people being prosecuted in all Muslim countries?
"Black folks have been elected mayors in cities the past half century, from Atlanta to Washington to Baltimore to Chicago to Los Angeles, plus as US President for two terms, so I am thinking there is some respect out there for black folks.

And the Western world includes a lot of cities in the Caribbean that are large majority black, where if there is no respect it is a self-inflicted wound."

"There is enough social glue out there and its going to be applied when diverse groups of Democrats and leftists come out in defense of working people, immigrants, African-Americans and other people of color, the poor, students, women and others targeted by the Trump fascists. 
The glue does not appear by magic but by the actual social act of coming together as groups of people opposed to fascism. Clearly, fascists will not join in the effort and do not know what to do except go along with the authoritarians and the Tyrant they have set loose on their own countrymen but history always remembers such craven sheep--the racists, the clinic bombers, the religious fanatics--captured in photographs, described in literature, and detested in the hearts of righteous people. Trump's groping fingers will penetrate Liberty but she will have her revenge."

Excellent article.  At the heart of the matter are arrogant people who seem to think that people of color are incapable of using our own voices.  Makes me (an older woman of color) laugh just thinking about it.  I suggest that we speak for ourselves and let others speak for themselves.  Should fix the problem.
"Yeah, I never understood that one other than they had too many sugar packs and creamers walking out the door. I'm a 'black' guy so it's not a beef with me."
"ha ha ha

I remember 16 years ago, when the ""poorly educated"" cheered their getting together to elect Bush and Cheney.
Then over 10,000 Americans were killed in the WTC, Iraq, Katrina,etc
Then unemployment increased to 10% and the American economy crashed because of their Republican policies. Then many Americans lost homes and life savings. Banksters were foreclosing on homes that did not have mortgages


Then 8 years ago, a black a guy was elected to clean up the Republican mess.
Unemployment dropped to under 5% and the stock markets tripled.
The S&P 500 went from 700 to 2,200."
"If this did indeed happen to him, shame on the LVPD.  I hope this is thoroughly investigated and if fault is found, Bennett is awarded in whatever way is determined.  However, I do not agree or condone the actions of the professional athletes 'sitting/kneeling' during the National Anthem. Their view of what the Flag/National Anthem stands for is somewhat skewed. I do believe that black men are singled out and at times for no reason other than they are black.  The PD's in the US need to get rid of the racist cops - at any given time it's determined they have shown they are racist - while on the job or otherwise. The police are to protect EVERYONE in this great nation - not just the ones they deem are deserving.  If that isn't what you want to do, then that is  NOT the job for you."
"Maybe, we should question if the S.C. reflects our beliefs and should we have some means to protect ourselves when they make poor decisions.  After all, no one is 100% correct all the time.  As a Canadian am I not entitled to my opinion.  I am deeply offended, how does the S.C. react to that."
"""I have heard the most vile words come out of the mouths of suburban teens talking about indigenous people, people of colour, and the LGBT community.""
------------
So true. 

But you forgot to mention that ""the most vile words come out of the mouths of suburban teens talking about indigenous people, people of colour, and the LGBT community"" also come from minorities talking about other minorities. Lack of civility and hatred knows no boundary of ""identity""."
"The latter questions in the article hit home for me.  Why are Western concerns and understandings of equality and spiritual roles pushed aside when they conflict with social and cultural roles among non-Western Catholics -- many of whom go along with ""woman as lesser vessel""?  The same hierarchy so worried that Western European and North American Catholics aren't reproducing enough and Roman Catholicism might become Sino-Afro-Hispanic Catholicism with a focus south of the equator.  When it comes to the issue of women's roles, it appears a mighty convenient excuse."
"Don't forget......

"Blacks and Palestinians are similar. Just ask Black Lives Matter who claim intersectionality with Palestinians. As soon as there's any perceived injustice, the race  cards go flying."
Did Chinese and Russian leaders show up in this report too ? They have billions stashed away. African leaders and other Asian countries no less.
"She apologized for the remark? It was a Clinton Presidency ""program"", a program which sent many Afican Americans to jail, an apology just doesn't work.

As far as the question I asked, I will answer for you-""pantsuit on fire"" is for women and LGBT rights-if it happens to be a election year, but in the off years she (Clinton FDN) is collecting millions from counties ( too many to list) that stone women to death for minuscule reasons, and prosecute/kill homosexuals for being different, I assume Arlene you are ok with this?

Instead of speaking against this and condemning these nations, Hilary, well let's just say she prefers to make bank ($$).

I'll vote with a very clear conscience, I hope you can do the same."
"As for the Conference battle flag, that wasn't racist until obama made it racist. 

More pure ignorance. The civil war was 100% about federal dominance of the several States, in direct contravention of the US Constitution. 

Even Lincoln said the war wsnat about slavery.  He just wasn't honest enouhg to say what it was actually about."
"Really hip cool progressive folks refer to black folks as ""brothers and sisters.""
  Just sayin'.
    lol"
"No, 'they' made it about the flag and our national anthem. Trump didn't start this, a very overpaid football 'player' did.  They get paid ridiculous sums of money to 'play' and while taking a stand is always respectable, doing it by trashing your own country and  with the least amount of 'cost' to themselves, is not worthy of any respect. 
.
The whole grievance is centered around so-called police brutality against blacks.  There have been some cases of police killing someone who, on the surface, 'appeared' to not be a threat. But put yourself in their shoes. They are targets. They wear a uniform and are hated by all kinds of criminals from gang members to drug dealers and prostitutes.  This has to run thru their mind every minute of every hour of every day. They are human and not robots, so they 'react' with very human reflexes and emotion.  The biggest victims of violence against blacks, unfortunately,  is by other blacks and not cops.  Who will take a 'knee' for all those victims?"
"Something is deeply wrong with the GOP. Even when the Obama/Democrats had control, they reached, way, WAY, across the aisle, and more or less adopted the right's plan and got it passed.


But, since he's not only a Democrat, but also black, the GOP has been irrationally lying about not only the plan, but working to sabotage it and hope no one notices what they are up to.


And they seem singularly obsessed with repealing what is essentially HeritageCare while offering no viable alternatives."
"The anarchists used to be red....but lost it to the Bolsheviks/ Communsts...then they turned to black, but lost it to the Fascists and Jihadists...."
"Once again, you confuse the Church with God. Just because the Church says something, doesn't mean God is bound by it. You have no idea who is in heaven or hell, or even if either exist."
">>He believed that no Canadian should be discriminated against because of his or her:.. ..religion,


That is not the discussion here, you are shifting the topic.

Objections are very specific:

Ditch the Islamophobia ( as it implies Canadian s are Islamophobes).
Freedom to criticize, question ANY religion.

Hate crimes against Blacks and Jews are the predominant one.

This whole political game has been in the making since the Liberals came to power, with Muslim activists quietly advancing their agenda."
"Black bears are like rats. Meaning they easily take up habitation amongst human kind. In my memory black bears have killed and eaten a couple of people beyond the events of last week. Brown bears usually do not feel comfortable amongst human kind. That said, it bears pointing out that we (humans) are dealing with an intelligent complex critter whenever we speak of bruins. Always remember that Bears respect size and force. Don't be a shrinking violet, remind the bear in question that you are the dominate creature. Carry an appropriate defensive weapon (most hand guns are of little value) THAT YOU ARE  CAPABLE OF HANDLING ( think muscle memory) and practice sound judgment whenever in bear country.   Running and biking bring you into the bears immediate domain quickly and shorten both the bears reaction time and yours.  Most bears do not want a fight and will seek escape. However you must be prepared."
"Feeling a bit harsh today, aren't we.  Ms. Shurtz made an error in judgment.  Clearly she had no malicious intent. IMO, it's the malicious intent of true racism, discrimination, and hate speech which is so despicable. If you feel Ms Shurtz is a person who  ""deserve(s) to have their (her) careers destroyed and ruined, "" what would you suggest should happen to someone who wears ""blackface"" to intentionally mock and belittle African Americans?  The ""stock"" in the public square? A public flogging? Stoning? Banishment?.....wait, this is what her colleagues feel, and, it seems,  you feel should happen to her.  

Let me stick my neck out here: a) be clear, I'm not ""defending"" her actions.....nor am I defending racism.....far from it.  b) however, I strongly feel all parties would benefit if those persons harmed could find it ""in their hearts"" to forgive.  The homily says ""To err is human, to forgive is Divine.""  How about it?"
"Asking  police to ""leave their uniforms, weapons and vehicles behind""  isn't being unreasonable.  After all, the others aren't wearing anything.   Nothing wrong with funding Pride, but the arguments expose a deep racial fissure between blacks and others.  You see it on university campuses now as well.  The deep division was inevitable once the black power movements began demanding ""inclusion"" to mean a melting pot -- what multi-culturalism in Canada had meant to avoid.  Now we're just like the U.S., but more vulnerable because of feeling guilt."
""" In fact, the entire “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” protest was based on a lie. Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot in Ferguson, Mo.""

Perhaps, but the final kill shot was straight down through the top of Brown's head, a fact the cop lied about in his testimony to the grand jury. Normally, when a potential suspect lies to the grand jury, there will be charges brought so that the truth can be sorted out in a trial. But the grand jury process in Ferguson was obviously a sham run by the DA, designed to get the cop off the hook. And that is the problem. The PROCESS of justice was denied, so people, especially minorities, can't trust the cops or the entire legal justice system. And that is a condition they were very used to in Ferguson, as evidenced by MANY examples of police targeting blacks there with no repercussions and no justice."
"""Black man"" is a poor description. Why is the name of the race forbidden? There is more traits to a race than color of the skin. And racial differences in the murder rate are huge."
"I'm not going to get into details because I'd prefer to keep myself anonymous but I do put my money where my mouth is on this issue. 

You correct this by fixing the opportunity gap. You shouldn't only have access to sub par education because you're in a black neighborhood. People think that because segregation ended then things are fine, and everything is fair. But that's not the case. The effects of racist policies impact multiple generations. 

When it comes to public education every student deserves the same quality of education. If you live in Palo Alto for example you shouldn't have schools in ruin on one side of the highway and elite over-funded schools on the other side. 

Obviously different regions to a point will have different resources. But the idea that a rich neighborhood within city limits gets better schools is fundamentally unfair. This is not just a racial issue but the reason it affects people of color more is the result of explicitly racist past policies."
"Pope Francis knows his enemies are legion and that he will not have all the time he needs to reform the curia. But he is most certainly agitating the curial cesspool and episcopal sauna...the mess will be for one of Francis' picks to finish the job! DiNardo had to do something but half-stepped it.

Mean while the  reactionary bishops appointed under JPii and Benedict xvi are so desirous of their back door channels and whispering innuendo- they are consolidating control with their reactionary priests, bred in the seminary to be the storm troopers to save the good and faithful Catholics from those radical priests and even the current occupant of the Chair of St Peter. 

A Vatican visitation is in order of the seminaries in this country, starting with St Charles B in Philadelphia and Mount St. Mary's in Emmitsburg."
There are many different kinds of privilege. Just because he is financially well off does not negate the issues that he and others have faced just for  being black in America.
"I really don't know about the civil rights movement.  What I do know is that before the Civil Rights Movement, about 80% of African Americans were living in intact families and now the out-of-wedlock birthrate is around 70%, far beyond what it is in other populations.  Is there a cause/effect?  Yeah.  Because part of civil rights was creating the Welfare State.

As women become more like men, the children suffer, relegated to being brought up by strangers or single moms, mostly."
"We have a clear choice this election. The law and order candidate...

If they need them for pain, fine.

They're adults, after all. 
Governments worldwide have proven themselves utterly incompetent in addressing the negative health outcomes associated with prohibition.
How could the health outcomes of legalization possibly be any worse than the 2500+ deaths from street opiate/opioid overdoses in 2016? (And nevermind the awful state of many addicts who nonetheless didn't die...)
We now have decades of proof: prohibition is a failed model.
It creates and encourages violent black markets, costs us untold millions in law enforcement and first response expenses, and .. oh yeah .. hasn't done _a thing_ to reduce the rate of drug use or accessibility in North America or anywhere else not run by a homicidal dictator named Duterte.
We've had decades of this garbage. DECADES. 
Time to change course entirely."
"No, the Declaration of Independence absolutely did NOT include Charles Dalton's ancestors. The early United States did ban the importation of humans, but it was almost another 100 years before slavery was abolished. Owners maintained slave populations with laws saying that the child of a slave was also a slave.

It's a little weird to use the Declaration in an argument with a black man, and quite aggregious to describe anything as slavery, except actual slavery.

It's not just a conservative thing; liberals are also guilty. I know conservatives and liberals both who think taxes they don't like are a form of ""slavery."""

"This one is interesting. By all means lets follow due course, flesh this out, if that expression meets civility standards, in particular the alledged offers ""to help the young woman’s parents"", an ""appointment to a committee to recognize the first black soldier in Canada"" and the offer ""to get her an internship in the Senate"". 

I want more on this one G&M."
"On Oct 20, 2015 the CBC news said, ""Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto, said Canadian diplomats are delighted at Trudeau’s election because Harper never let them speak without checking with the government first.""

In Oct 2017 we're in a position where the PM wouldn't let the minister of finance even speak for himself, choosing to humiliate the minister and embarrass  himself.  

The pot calling the kettle black. The nasties for our PM and his woefully incompetent government are just getting started.  Even the NDP under angry Tom would have been better than this lot."
"That is a very isolated Wilderness area.  It has some rugged terrain.   It is also an area with dense cougar and black bear populations.

One really should not hike such remote places by yourself.  Especially if you are elderly.  It is much safer to hike in a group of people when visiting Wilderness areas.  That way if a person gets injured, others can help him, and also go to get help.   Maybe even bring some kind of weapon with you. 

Here is a link below to a real good in-depth, follow-up story that the Oregonian newspaper did about this subject after U of O mathematics professor Daming Xu disappeared while Wilderness hiking in 2007, and Eugene hiker James Dutton disappeared in 2012.   Shockingly, the Oregonian noted that between 1997 and 2013, 189 men, and 51 women have disappeared in Oregon Wilderness areas, never to be seen again.  That is 240 people lost in just 17 years!!
