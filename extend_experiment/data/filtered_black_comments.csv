even up here.......BLACKS!
"The first slave owner in America was BLACK!!!!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthony_Johnson_(colonist)"
Another rabidly racist post from an angry black male with a victim mentality looking for reparations.
"Trump also says:

""It's freezing and snowing in New York - we need global warming!""

""You know, it really doesn't matter what the media write as long as you've got a young, and beautiful piece of ass.""

""... if I were starting off today, I would love to be a well-educated black.""

""My fingers are long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my body.""

""I think the only difference between me and other candidates is that I'm more honest and my women are more beautiful.""

""Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are little short guys that wear yarmulkes every day."""
"Is this a joke??...what happened to freedom of speech/expression? Is this woman a hater of people of color? I am sure she is not. She may have chosen a costume of an obese person, or Ghengis Kahn or Ella Fitzgerald, Sacagawea etc..what is wrong with us? We need to get over ourselves and not have such a need to micro-manage, assume and assault someone elses choice for a Holloween Costume for heavens sake. It was a party costume!!..., not as if she went to a black persons home and scrawled the ""N"" word all over it...or Go back to Africa...as some idiots have done. If that was the case she should be fired and run out of town in a New York minute. Knowing how our society has run common sense off in the ditch...she should have known however that she might get some pc backlash but loosing her job???...does the ""crime"" (offended someone's sensibilities) fit the punishment? If you say yes, then crawl out of the ditch and give it another thought please."
And black bigotry emerges again.
Criticize a black man and the left calls you a racist.  Criticize a woman and you are a sexist. Now I will critcize you as a fool and you can call me intolerant.
This also sounds like any number of blacks.   Are you one of them?  Are you a member of the Black Riders?
"Bunch of kneeling illiterates squatting on a lie, while black on black killings continue at record levels in cities"
"Option 5: just drop the useless thing. Everyone knows who kills indigenous women but this is not what the indigenous leader wants to talk about, they want to talk about the police and ""systemic racicism"". This reminds me of Black Lives Matters who attacks the police for killing black men but won't talk about black on black crimes that kills way more black men then the police."
ITS A RACE BATING GAME TO AVOID THE TRUTH AND FACTS.WE ALL KNOW; ISLAM ENCOURAGES THE RAPE AND BEATING OF WOMEN ESPECIALLY NON MUSLIMS.. ITS A RIGHT THEY FEEL THEY HAVE. TORONTO.  SERIAL RAPIST WAS MUSLIM 1000 WOMEN HE RAPED. THIS ARTICLE IS SMOKE AND MIRRORS. WE ARE NOT STUPID. #BlackLivesMatter dont let them pander to you! this is not a color thing this is a religious culture issue that the left is using you to hide. wake up Black Men. Don't take the bait.
Hey Auston you're wrong. There's nothing disrespectful about protesting the current state of your country. Otherwise women would still not be able to vote and black people would be riding in the rear of buses.
"because they ARE a hate group. they hate everybody except black lives matter, the black panthers, etc. but don't mention that here, your comment will be removed. its called civility."
"Oh please.  How silly.  Where is the leadership in the Black communities.  Jesse Jackson, Al Sharpton?  No they just keep telling their base how downtrodden they are in order to justify there personal existence, and keep the money flowing into their racist organizations.
These players are just whinners, who know nothing and propose NO solutions, as they drive away from the stadium each Sunday in their $200,000 dollar Lamborghinis."
"Get behind Transgender, homosexuals, blacks, native indians, hispanics, Muslims,
Jews and defeat Trump"
"OK yeah, but it was OBAMA! Understand? A Keynesian, communist black man fer crisssakes! He be dude with SUPERPOWERS! Evil SUPERPOWERS! That's what I just read on BOTH Zerohedge AND What Really Happened!  OOOPS! I'm so excited I just fizzed my SIXTH! PBR on my lap!"
"""Black males are disproportionately shot by police."" Go on... what else is disproportionate about black male behavior? You're so close but just won't put your finger on it, will you Washington Post? Honestly, committing 50% of violent crime and only being 25% of those shot by police sounds like it would be evidence of police bias in their favor..."
"I'm soooooo tired of this dumbass DemoKKKrat.  This Dizzy Twit and the rest of the Congressional Black Caucus is *worthless*...

Despite being in Congress for 20 years - This race-baiting POS has sponsored exactly THREE (3) pieces of legislation. No...I'm not kidding.  As a Black Conservative - I DESPISE this obnoxious, race-baiting, utterly dishonest piece of sh*t."
Frazier would been branded an uncle Tom if he stayed. Blacks don't respect the KKK.
Ussien Bolt showed more respect to our anthem than Gabby! She's an idiot who got sucked into the political show but her background as a gymnast doesn't jive with 98% of all other athletes and people in the world of real and respect. The only place the skill she learned is going to be useful is at the Olympics no where else because she refused to incorporate discipline and respect into her actions. Stop kissing blacks asses.
I am sick of racist blacks. Boycott pro sports!!
"Listen folks just because people think you're an uneducated, racist hate monger doesn't mean that you don't vote.  If you think Mr. Trump missed that point then you're not paying attention.  If you think the alt right cause is anything other than a red meat dog whistle for Mr. Trump's top advisor Mr Bannon then you're not paying attention.  Mr. Trump won't win the black vote anyway (ever) so why not put your cards down on the opposition?  Mr. Trump's first 6 mos have been a disaster unparalleled in American presidential history.  He's not going to start pushing away perfectly good votes just because of some silly jack booted nazi salute or confederate flag.  Please."
"oh really olrun? you are the ignorant one. ask the native peoples that practice it! animal sacrifice, killing albinos, etc. etc. the black arts are alive and well."
"If she is a nigger, she isn't worth a flying fuck to Africa!"
"MOAR SCARY BLACK PEOPLE NEWS, ADN!

Better? You're welcome."
"You never wonder how they came here dirt poor, and became stinking rich in such a short time?  They achieved what many South Africans didn't."
"Conservative angst over dead black babies is the most laughable concern trolling.

Talk to me when the conservative movement gives the first damn about live black babies."
"You're evidently against the man because he's black. Thus, ""I deem you racist!"""
We already know that you're a racist who doesn't think black lives matter.
Blacks are intellectual inferiors even to Mexicans!
How does all lives matter say that black lives don't matter? Your racism is showing!
"This is what they chant when protesting, how do you read this.
Black Lives Matter Protesters Chant 'Pigs In A Blanket, Fry 'Em Like Bacon!' KILL THE COPS!

Are you calling ""cops"" fascist thugs?"
We already know that you're a racist who doesn't think black lives matter.
"Point us to where and when Republicans had the black family all squared away, ignorant racist."
"Alaska Republicans, stay outta this. Ya'll don't want us brown and black folks, we'll be here forever. Can't stop us from propagating..LOL."
Really? Blacks asking for fair treatment is hating cops?
Bunch of racists!  I suppose all BLACK bears look alike huh?
Eh.  Rush isn't a racist.  He just LOVES little black Dominican boys.
"You people are worrying about the wrong thing. First of all I am a black man. I am not an uncle Tom or a coon. You actually might say I am ultra militant. But for you to raise this hot button issue in polarizing times like this only serves to drive a wedge between those who might be like minded and supportive of your core causes. Who gives a shit about the anthem? They can have it, after all we have ours. This old woman should not have any say in running the organization if that is what her leadership is about. Don't stand for it it if that is your preference. But don't take it away from those who want to. And there are many blacks that want to. Danny Davis is a fool to bring this nonsense to capitol hill. He is like Al Green of Texas and is a nobody in the congress. All he is doing is attempting to raise his profile. And this old woman who is president is trying to make herself relevant. Do this sit down and STFU and try to help us reclaim the Congress. This only hurts."
"black folk must fix black folk_ I am black and hatred exists even within the family._since you are a member of the ANC, ask your bosses where are the schools?all the good schools, hospitals and townships were built by the <RACIST WHITES>_ the real problem is the absence of good schools in black areas.  the ANC IS THE DEVIL"
Black power?????  What a joke.
"You just can't stand that a women and black man had power. Trump lies, Trumps people lie, trump has illegal ties with Russia. Trumps moral actions are disgusting. You are a traitor to this wonderful country."
"Hey Mateo, ever been to Texas? It's the second most diverse state. Lots of black and Hispanic police officers. What a stupid press release."
"""Black men are primarily responsible for that."" This part of your statement is true. This country would not exist were it not for millions of black slaves. The colonies from Maryland south would never have joined the ""Revolution"" without protections for race based slavery. We would be more like Canada without race based slavery.  In 1860, 80% of the wealth of the nation was from slaves, slave labor, and the products that labor produced. The violence today is a product of our history. The rest of your statement is just fake news."
"The guy who confessed in St.Louis was African -American. I guess we can expect outrage against all
Blacks in the U.S."
"""Youre ignorant. If e wins (he wont of course), then no one is safe. Blacks, Jews, gas, women-al will be refused for religious nonsense reasoning. We will NEVER allow that""
==============
Are you threatening violence against the United States....are you threatening civil war against the Unites States.....should ""your side"" lose?
-
If so, you are more of a threat to this nation than a baker who declined to decorate a cake will ever be."
"LOL! Yes, she lost because she's a woman just like Obama lost because he's black. Oh, wait... Hillary had nothing to offer, had no message, basically carried an empty bucket... gilded, but empty."
What ever you went through it would have been worse if you were black. Enjoy your good life now.
"Sure blame the Congress woman and the window of a killed soldier on being the liars... 

I saw Donald said he has proof this morning. Is this proof like the proof Obama was from Africa, or is it proof like head had on Obama wore tapping him.  Naa he's just a dumb rascist."
"Why is it not attempted murder? This is nothing. And I think they should water bord to get that teen to talk of the others that was with him!! Wtf!!! So tired of these young kids these days. No morals, no respect, no punishment!! Hell I was arrested at 19 for telling s black cop he was being racist. Thrown into jail one night and stood in front of a judge who handed me my punishment and said. If I did not do it I would be arrested again and would be put in jail for 3 to 6 months. And that was just saying something to s cop. It's bull shit how things are now. Granted I never went back to Jail , never been arrested since then. I learn my lesson ."
Guess you ancestors shouldn't have been captured by your fellow black folks and sold to European traders... not Americans ... if you are so upset move back to Africa ... you won't because you know it's better here...
Thank you for your racist sexist views.
Dude gotta ask where in hawaii did you watch the older men drop the n word and boy when talking about blacks. been livin here a long time and in the 60s weren't no blacks but a few military who'd kick yer butt if ya called em boy. what you smokin dude.
"Shameless pandering.  Unless, of course, he was protesting the unbelievable amount of murders in Chicago that neither the President nor Hillary or Black Lives Matter care to address."
Have you heard Milo speak.  He is a gay man whose likes black men.  I don't agree with everything he says but I at least listen.
"Hey troll. Back at it making your useless, snide self-revealing comments after stealing the online identity of a decent commenter.   Yeah, you represent that clown, Trump, very well. Loser."
The same old rubbish just a different Zuma. The Zumas either think that we are all stupid or they Simpy don't care. Accountability does not apply to the Nkandla clan. They all are a curse on South Africa and are still busy wringing out the very lost drops to fill their gigantic piggy banks.
"It mist have been because her face was literally black, otherwise its not p.c, its b.s...her b.s."
"cont.
.... clear case of Racial Profiling By the Police!  =:-o   (By damn, it doesn't get much worse than that!)

Oh, and on the 'no excuses' meme, here is a very interesting academic paper from the early Obama years with some pertinent examples of how many *black Americans* were saying it was 'no excuses' time for ... black Americans.  ;-)   The scholars frankly concluded that in fact, black Americans still had plenty of excuses for personal failure (although they had to employ a lot of rather weak ""yeah - but!"" arguments, in my view).  :-/   I'd be interested on your take of this (also shared with Mr. Skeexix):  http://web.utk.edu/~blouis2/files/No%20More%20Excuses.pdf

Thanks for your words."
I think they need to stick this little weirdo into the blackest prison in the state and the guards should take 1 hour off for lunch.
The murder of transgenders this year has been one of black men killing black transgenders.  Great denial out there in GLBT and BLM community on this problem.
Blacks weren't exactly voting in droves for Clinton either.
"Haha what a bunch of anti-semantics, I bet if she were black, everyone on this forum would be calling the security guard a nazi."
"Hillary's "" Negro dialect"" !

"You're confusing ""a"" problem with ""the"" problem. Certainly black poverty, and the sick culture that has grown up around it, is a problem. But racist pigs that continue to stand up for the confederacy and what it stood for are also part of the problem."
"His state of mind is everything. A good atty will be hard to come by cause this will be one hell of a case to fight in trial. Anyone have $50,000 handy as a retainer? Billy Austin!! By Steve Earl comes to mind.. They will try to hang this guy in light of what has been happening in town.. He's an easy target. There is a reason the convicted are black, brown and poor.. Everyone with a brain knows that truth."
"Statistics on black crime, native graduation rates and the sheer amount of illegal aliens in this country are exactly why the should be scrutinized, or 'marginalized' as you say, more than others."
"Why should they frighten you? You aren't black or liberal, or LGBTQ, or Latino, or Muslim. You probably blend right in."
"Sorry dude, every major city has a street named after this guy, hundreds of thousands of young black people, and some not black people, have drawn inspiration from this guy to be better people. If you want to dig anyone's dirty laundry you'll find stuff that stinks, but at a certain point the moral example is just stronger than some stinky socks."
We have the Proud-were not a frat-Boys on one side and on the other side the Blackshirts of the Hillary youth getting ready for a Bro down.    Gay orgy to follow
You can read stuff like that in the Old Testament; that's why Christ reformed all that hogwash.
"Well it's nice to know that if I ever really hate somebody, I get one mostly-free murder. As long as I'm acting like a moron, I'm not a black man, and it's an ""accident."""
Is there anything more pathetic than the sound of Lord Black complaining that his testicles have been tampered with. I mean in a way Lord Black did NOT like. At least to admit.
What we REALLY need to squelch are under-informed and over-opinionated cop-haters like you who always react in knee-jerk fashion when a cop kills a violent perpetrator. Are you by any chance a member of the hate group Black LIES Matter?
It will always be your A typical african parasitic state inhabited by amoebas.

If you cramped in a championship game? Ha...the Argos are never gonna be in a Championship game... and you will never win the real prize. The Super Bowl cause you suck. Mean while, Big European clubs are lining up to make offers for Giovinco....he's already won multiple Serie A titles ."
"Mr. Black (nee Goebbels), your comment would be more accurate if spoken with a German accent."
Another multimillionaire black man whining.
"Cowards?  Like those who say that a total stranger's ""mother was frightened by a Negro"" when s/he was in the womb?
Those types of cowards?"
Mr. McCoy should go back to where he came from and stop bringing killers to Hawaii. His black man defense is weak and ignorant.
"It is very much partisan stupidity ......................
The ACA was closely modeled after the program all Republicans praised Romney for in Massachusetts. 
When a Black President proposed it nationally, Southern Republicans immediately switched to hating it."
"Reminds me of another great adventurer - Dick ""Black Ass"" Griffith."
Unfortunately if we are going to allow free speech then it has to be for all and not just black lives matter or the liberals it has to include all nuts.
"Maher is the perfect person to do just the opposite of what he does and says.  He is the model of what NOT to do.  Funny?  Yeah, he is very funny sometimes.  But he hides behind his being a ""comedian"" whenever he goes too far and gets in trouble, which is pretty often.  His racist comments recently about blacks is just one of many things he wished he never said.  Atheist, socialist, racist and hypocrite is the way to describe him in my opinion.  I'll bet he was pummeled as a kid by just about everyone, even the girls.  I can see him running all over the school playground with a bunch of people wanting to kick his butt for saying stupid things!!  On his show if the audience doesnt laugh at his sick jokes he gets mad.  LOL!  That says it all in my opinion."
Wtf does his contract have to do with this topic. I clearly bet you are a racist and it upsets you a black man is getting this much money to entertain us. Dobt blame him blame the nba. The nuggets had tonspend that money. It is required so why not go get a good player?
"What a load of unmitigated racist drivel. How do the these views square with the success of the Jewish community in Canada - particularly in academia?

"Steve Harvey is a racist and bigot.
Anyone noticed how many BLACKS are on Family Feud since he took over ?
We stopped watching since 13% of the U.S. population, accounts for 85% of the show's contestants."
"Donald Trump is a world class a**hole, racist pile of crap. Has to stir the pot with N Korea, refuses to acknowledge PR and the USVI, tells black athletes they don't have first amendment rights after calling them sons of *itches, supports nazi protest in NC, calls mexicans murderers rapists? Anything I missed? He needs to go skull f**k himself with a giant rubber *ick."
"And don't forget the pandering to people who want to kill the jews and the blacks.  

Let's not forget about that."
"DISTASTEFUL...that's it...DISTASTEFUL...what is he serving, sour milk?  A human being who thrives on BULLYING is distasteful.  Tell that to the thousand of children, women, employees who are bullied each and every day...no worries...its just distasteful?  Good God, the future president of the USA is a mysogynistic, homophobic, racist, sexist dim wit!  He has the temperament of a 2 year old with a fever and runny nose.  So thin skinned you can see through it!  But distasteful...come on, even a grade 2 student would have a better adjective to describe this pompous ass!"
Lebrun James is disgusting! I used to like him but he stumped for HRC the biggest most corrupt politician to EVER run and called blacks SUPER OREDATORS and he trashes Trump?? I quit watching NBA because of him and the Seattle Seahawks version of the NBA-GS Warriors! They're friggn racists and I'm DONE! Only college football for me until......let's unite and boycott the NFL/NBA!!! ESPN is dying too thank the lord.....RACIST LIBTARDS
"Not to forget Zuma selling our fishing rights and many industries to the Chinese (wonder how much that kickback was worth).  But I agree, it is time to take our country back.  Unfortunately, reversing the racism sowed by the Zupta club must be the first step since we can only do it together, all us ""stupid Africans"" of whichever race."
Can't wait for his next meltdown when someone does his genealogy and he finds out his grandma is Jewish and his great-granddad is Black.
Your posts HAVE no substance. Men in black = holy. How dangerously stupid.
"Oh sure, put a black guy in the role of ""Caesar"" and youd be crying to anyone with ears."
"Can the miserable Tyler Chatwood experiment please be mothballed? This is getting ridiculous. Bud Black is as clueless as Mark Kiszla here. Chatwood is horrible. Period. Like the late, not-lamented Jordan Lyles, putting him out there is like announcing that you have no intention of winning. But I'm sure he is a good teammate..."
"OH How quickly The Losers Forget! Let us Not Forget Obama's ""They cling to their Bibles and Guns"" civility- A direct attack on the rights and principles of America. Profanity to the ears of a patriot. And HRC's ""Basket of deplorables""...hmmm, yes... Civil and charming!
WHEN, precisely, did President Trump Ever Call blacks ""N***** s"" ?"
"I think individuals care more than our governments do.  When I think of the conditions inside that country--the starvation due to mismanagement and corruption, the state sponsored--or required--of family members spying on each other and reporting the smallest infractions that often lead to death sentences, horrible work camps, it makes me ill.. A satellite map of the world shows a black hole at night where North Korea should be.  And that fat psychotic killer with the bad hair killing his own relatives in the most horrendous ways is absolutely sickening.  The North Korean people will never be able to mount a revolution due to being absolutely repressed and brainwashed. Heard an inteview with an escapee who had been forced to kill his own mother.  They have no idea what the outside world is even like.   Christopher Hitchens prior to his trip to NK said he refused to use the term ""Orwellian.""  Once there he said he had no choice--it is indeed an Orwellian nightmare."
"The Kadhr family.... a shining example of the Canadian head up its a** thinking... a family living off the system - welfare, social programs, etc. while contributing nothing in return... father, mother, brothers, sisters... and killing people to advance their Islamic ideals.
I won't waste my time detailing all this... look it up yourself.... the whole bunch of them should have been deported/shipped out as enemies of Canada a long time ago, but as usual, the head up their a**es Canadian dolts actually support these morons.
So this dolt is getting expensive surgery and support for injuries he suffered as he was trying to kill Coalition soldiers - Canadian included - in that cesspool of Islamic hate in the Middle East.... perfect example of Canadian stupidity."
"I thought you guys said we cant call people of color ""thugs"" because its racist!"
"Are you defending Trump? If so, you have poor judgement. Also, who gives a f**k how she dresses? How do you dress? What's your job? Not only did she become a Congresswoman, despite hardships of being black and a woman, she is standing up for our Fallen. I'd say look at yourself before you judge others. She deserves some respect."
"Huh? The Left ain’t got nothing on the African American Left. 
This is the most radical ground of hateful, the ends justify the means, nasty, bigoted group of legislators EVER. Talk about racism. They’re all elitist anti Semites to begin with. 
What kind of a stupid question is that? Just so everyone understands, this group of people truly believe that Trump hates black people, and that he want to put them all back in bondage. It’s insane."
He got off easy cuz hes a black dude. Its obvious.
"It's your ilk who throws race into the mixture, amigo!  You need not call others niggers or wetbacks!  You've cleaned up your rhetoric over the years so that you needn't spit hateful words;  your ilk (and the rest of us, unfortunately) recognizes the euphemisms that use to avoid being labeled racists.

Good luck with that."

"Trump is quite the hypocrite.

If you subsitute Blacks or Muslims for the neo-Nazis, Trump would have sent in the National Guard, who would have pepper-sprayed and shot them. Then, he would have declared martial law and had every Black and Muslim person arrested if they were out after dusk."

"Just stop with the ""neglected minorities"" not being represented!   I don't see any Blacks, Japanese, Koreans, and so on nominated!  It's 2017."
Blacks aren't being killed in greater numbers they just have a higher possibility of being shot due to the fact they make up a smaller percentage of the population yet commit a larger percentage of the crimes.
"They are protesting dirty cops murdering innocent black people? Where did you hear that? Also thanks for the cursory introduction to law.

"Great Science at Berkeley, some of the best in the world.

Unfortunately, the problem is what to do with all those affirmative action entrants, many of whom are dumber than a bag of hammers.  Liberal arts programmes like Women/Black/indian/Mexican/you-name-it Studies along with Social Sciences are dirt cheap to run, and easy to teach.  The politically correct mandate, lets a bunch of mouth breathing morons in, takes their federal money for programs costing about as much as a pizza to run, then produces a bunch of indoctrinated idiots with worthless degrees.  No wonder they're mad.

Keep in mind who the top cheese in the UC system is, one of the biggest idiots of them all.

Yes you are right Dalton Trump is such a racist that he was given an award by Jesse jackson for hiring so many black people and wasn't it Trump that said he wouldn't fly in the same plane as Moochele Obama ...Nope I guess that was Hillary
"Why do you say that? Many black Christians are victimized by bigots, and SPLC works to change that.

Why do you write such nonsense? just to get a reaction? Are you nothing but a mindless troll, or are you more like a ""prostitute"", who posts just to get ""hits""?

Well, get in line, girlie. It took african americans over 200 years for their freedom movement, and they're not done yet.

Crossing your arms and stomping your feet like a spoiled 4 year old isn't going to solve anything.

"This article is pure bunk.  The democrats work hard every day to make blacks believe republicans will kill their children via the police. Trump only detailed how the country is today under the dems and how he will improve it.

"Thanks man. but This ain't a democracy brother Michael. This is a constitutional Republic with, get ready for this; its own culture, values and laws which it derived from Judeo-Christian principles. I know that last bit always offends liberals. But ignoring the facts does not make them any less true. 

Muslims put their religion, their race, their culture before everything. And now they thrive amongst a people who are afraid to talk about their religion, race and culture.

I sure as hell know and they know that our countries have messed it up royally . So then why, why do women want to lower themselves to cover up there faces when facing the world?  Why and what are they ashamed of.  Why don’t they offer us the courtesy of seeing them when engaging us in conversation?  Why live with rules that date black to ancient times. Are they afraid of there men still. Baffles my mind.   I am a male that came from that backward culture and these people make me wonder why they come here but live in the same stupid backwards world they wanted so desperately to leave."

Only in so far as it shows hate for minorities and the vulnerable.

"That's right!  Live and let live!  So we need to allow pedophiles to do what they will because we want to live and let live.  We need to not discourage people from killing each other because we want live and let live.  We want to let people kill all Jews, blacks, Christians, etc., because it's what these people want to do and we want to live our lives the way we want to!  I think life would be so much better if we subscribed to this philosophy!

The problem with you saying we should subscribe to this philosophy is that it's absurd.  It's too simplified a statement.  What do you actually mean when you say this?  There have to be limits for society to be able to function!"

All black people support Obama because he is black?  That's not true. All people who support Trump are racist, deplorable, rich and stupid?  That's not true. Give me a break.

It's tragic so many Clintonites like you Paul ignored all the baggage and the lies and the record that made their candidate such a terrible one and have in turn given the GOP and Trump the best chance for victory.

On the other hand black men and women throughout the history of U.S. has gone off to war to fight for freedoms they did/do not have in the country they were fighting for - not unlike FNs.  Ali lost his licence to box, was stripped of his titles, and stood out the best years of this boxing career when he said

“My conscience won’t let me go shoot my brother, or some darker people, or some poor hungry people in the mud for big powerful America.  And shoot them for what? They never called me ni**r, they never lynched me, they didn’t put no dogs on me, they didn’t rob me of my nationality, rape and kill my mother and father. … Shoot them for what? How can I shoot them poor people? Just take me to jail.”

"America is infamous for, having Sundays being the most Segregated day of the week, especially the hours when people go to church. It tends to confound foreigners who are Protestant. Of course, Catholics in the United States have either lots of Latinos in their churches or in a reflection to the 19th and 20th centuries Ethnic enclaves ; I would gather Latino, Vietnamese, Filipino etc;.

The big divide of course, was/is the Black American Catholic issue. I have seen the lures of "" Gospel Masses, Afro Centric"" and such being used as a lure, but not just the Novus Ordo,  or an approved Mass in Latin and heaven FORBID if you're Black and venture into the Traditional Catholic realm; you will NOT be welcomed. I learned that lesson in 1992 myself!
 
You have to be a very brave person to go where you may not be wanted; for me it as deciding that leaving ""Traditional Catholicism"" was better than getting arrested in a suburban ""house church"". Food for thought."

Opps, wrong topic.  Black Vance must go.  His IQ is too low and he looks totally lost.  He is lucky to have a win at all.  Chargers and Raiders almost beat us in the end.  I see no trace whatsoever of the Broncos of past on offense.

One idiot (Kaepernik), gets demoted because he sucks, so the very next week he throws a tantrum under the guise of ""Protest"",  (Even though he NEVER said a SINGLE word before about ANYTHING ever before), and thereby starts this wave of ignorance & stupidity nationwide.

Got to love Trump.  No more red carpet from the Kenyan illegal idiot!  The illegal Oidiot has no roots in this country from his black half.  We need to deport him too!
"This was never about defying Trump, this was always about ignorance on the part of the black players.  The Broncos management is as stupid as they are.  I emailed them a week ago to say just that.  

For myself and apparently many others, we no longer give a crap about the blacks or their grievances.  The nfl and the Broncos will lose this battle , as they have already lost me and those many others who see it as anti-American, unpatriotic display.  Go join blm and march on YOUR time, not mine.

"Protesting the national anthem, because you think all cops are racist pigs who kill blacks based on color, is like refusing to drink Gatorade, because you think coffee growers are killing bean pickers in the fields. One has absolutely nothing to do with the other. If you want to protest police policy, why not go to the station with signs? 

This all started when the racist, BLM cop hater Kaepernick wore socks with cartoon pigs wearing police uniforms. BLM is a parade of lies. Trayvon Martin and Mike Brown were both killed during violent assaults. Hands up don't shoot was a huge lie.

If BLM and their uninformed followers really cared about black lives, they would be marching through the big city ghettos trying to stop blacks from slaughtering other blacks. See Chicago. A black person in America is more likely to be killed by other black person than any other group, BY FAR. And cops are more likely to be killed by blacks than the other way around. The truth can hurt sometimes."

Refusing services to blacks in not religious. Refusing to perform mixed race marriage is also not religious (no Biblical prohibition based on race).

Hobby Lobby is not being asked to provide personal services for a (insert religious objection like ""gay wedding"" here). The baker will sell cake all day long to anyone who asks. The decorations are his personal services specific to the wedding (akin to wedding photographers services).

Not nearly as simple as it looks. Can't wait to read what SCOTUS has to say."
"Based on the widely circulated eye-witness account of the (himself armed) guitarist Caleb Keeter - in which he recanted his life-long opposition to gun control after BEING in that situation and finding his own gun useless. 

This was a country music show in America. Country music - the stuff gun nuts all listen to, the stuff they blare when they walk into family restaurants with an AR-15 slung to their backs and say they are excercising their ""rights""*. There were probably more guns in the crowd than in Paddock's hotel room.

*I put rights in quotes because even in America you don't have a right to carry a gun onto somebody else's private property without their permission. Open-Carry laws don't actually mean the owner of the local McDonalds has to allow you to scare kids with your massive penis-extension hanging out. Indeed, any SANE restaurant owner would call the cops thinking he is about to be the victim of an armed robbery - and if a black man does it, you KNOW he will."
Yawn. You think Hillary Clinton isn't racist? If you do you are a fool. She accepted a $20k check from the KKK for her campaign. She was caught on video making a racist comment about Mexicans. She went to a college costume party in black face. Get your head out of the sand! Mr. Trump is not racist. That is liberal lies!
"Hillary is 100% correct! Her loss had NOTHING to do with the fact she was an awful candidate, a corrupt venal entitled puppet for Wall Street, an arrogant presumptuous psychopath, a two-faced lying hypocrite, none of these factors had ANYTHING to do with her loss--Why? you might ask--BECAUSE all these characteristics were obvious to all in the DNC who anointed her as the NEXT ""identity"" to become royalty--black, then female, apparently was the order of coronation by the Left--

The Media had already prepared their glossy covers with her crown in place--

The media still betrayed her--They could NOT ignore (as they had intended) the Republican candidate despite their orders--Trump played them like PT Barnum and they dutifully kept him FRONT and CENTER in the headlines--even trying to ridicule him as they did, Trump's name was in the news daily and the ""deplorables"" (those ignored by the mainstream parties) who were themselves ""mad as hell"" voted their disgust of party politics--hah, hah"
"President Obama will be known as America's last and final great president. It is fitting that he is a Black man.

Both have their sights on the economies of China and Mexico, and India. And to the victor goes the spoils as Trump already said about the Middle East - oil is the big prize there for both Trump and Putin. My predictions always come true."

She doesn't even know the Brandenburg gate fell so long ago.
Sleeping in till noon at her dacha by the lake she assumed the Communist Party finally took over cause some black guy was President.....

Hillary was a shoe-in cause who would dare defy the Goddess!! 

Then of course all those deadbeat billions which now are wasted on 50% of the Canadian and US population that won't work but suck at the throat of the taxpayer cry that she is s goddess....

"Sorry, genius, but you could not govern Rome without the support of the populus; even the Praetorians weren't stupid enough to try.   They kept their fingers in the wind too.   Rome didn't fall, it went broke; it could no longer provide for both the mob and the Legions after Roman Africa, Rome's breadbasket, fell to the Vandals.   You had the winning combination of crony capitalism trying to hold the African rent farmers harmless and the Roman/Ravennan power elite trying to keep the mob from ripping them to shreds by trying to provide for them with dwindling wealth.   Sounds a lot like the US today.   The Gibbons' meme is just Christian ""moral failing"" propaganda; the end of the Western Roman Empire was just real politic.

They had the right to peacefully do that and they did, BLM and Antifa do not have the right to beat people up and shout them down, it is they who have blood on their hands as much as the driver.

"So a cop retaliating against a black kid by publicly stripping him and fondling his genitals is some sort of programmed ""survival response"" in an emergency situation?  I tend to doubt that..."
"Before you do that IDIOT and DISRESPECT thing, supposedly this is ALL for blacks killed by Police. THINK about the FACTS that ALL but ONE ( that officer sentenced to life in prison ), were killed while in the commission of yet ANOTHER FELONY, ALL RESISTED arrests, NONE HAD THEIR hands up, NONE NONE NONE, ONLY ONE had fewer that EIGHT prior FELONY CONVICTIONS, including the PUNK THUG in La. who was convicted of RAPING THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. Think of those FACTS."
"But does anyone ever share 100% of your values?  I saw a video of someone walking through the streets of NYC asking people who claimed to be Hillary voters who said a particular quote, Hillary or Trump, then a somewhat shocking quote was read.  Almost everyone attributed it to Trump, yet they were Hillary quotes.  I take those things with a grain of salt because you never know how they are edited, but Hillary was anti-gay marriage until it became politically expedient for her in the past couple of years.  Hillary's campaign staff started the Obama birther controversy.  Hillary called black men ""Super Predators"".  I could go on.  Don't mistake this as me suggesting Trump has never done similarly stupid things, but are they really ""values"" if people are willing to set them aside to support a political party?"
John you are so racist!! Thugging around oh you say that because they are black... quit with the racism if you actually were educated about anything in particular this issue you would know that many of these players have foundations that help their communities!! John you are a disgrace to America and to your family. Shame on you!
"The Jones Act was immediately lifted to help Texas and Florida.
It took the nation two weeks of shaming Trump before he acted to help Puerto Rico.
He spent that time making lame and nonsensical excuses for why he couldn't lift the ban.
In other news:
Trump continues to shore up his racist base by dropping more racial dog whistles. Now he says NFL owners are 'afraid' of their black players.
Yep, the plantation is under threat by the uppitys all over again. Trump is a racist.

They will bend the law, they will close their eyes to molestation, ignore unethical practices AS LONG AS they can achieve a certain outcome i.e: they will elect a pedophile with no respect for the law as long as their outcome is achieved. The outcome? They want someone in power who will make sure blacks will never be in charge of their state, they want someone in charge to make sure gays will never be treated like human beings in their state. It goes back to their lynching days where they would Lynch a black man without evidence just to appease the ignorant redneck populace.

"Charles, you are the one that said all you get from the dems. are the crumbs from the table. Your question to me about what I have in common with bigots is ridiculous and you know it. To ask such a question shows a lack of even the remotest ability to look beyond what the very narrow minded have told you to think. Do you really believe that all those who voted for BHO throughout this nation and then voted for DT became racist, nazis and kkk members all of a sudden? If you want to lump all DT voters together then by your thinking it is ok to lump all dems. as rioters and narrow minded bigots. It is ok to say all dems. support fascist tactics. It is ok to say that since I know of black murderers and rapist that thinking all blacks are murderers and rapist is ok .  As far as your unfounded accusations Charles, that dog don't hunt. It is a used up tactic to make an unfounded accusation and then let the person defend it. I'm not a racist a bigot or against equality, enough said on that!!!"

You sound just like the black who Murdered my son, and I have very little tolerance for racist like you, no matter their race. All racist are despicable, all! If you really cared about black lives, all black lives, you would focus your energys on fixing the dem party that has failed the blacks instead of using all your energy to further spread your hatred. You realize the dems are using you don't you? You do realize DT tried to help Chicago and try and save some black lives but RE refused right? Do you really like being used? How long will you continue allowing yourself to be taken advantage of?"
"Dick Rhyner is a despicable cretin that should be banned. At every turn he is only interested in maximizing the sensational and voids anything that contains compassion or intelligence.

"Do honest believe cops go out to streets looking to shot a black man? And do you honest believe these cops shoot these black men without some form provocation, and not just because of the color of skin. It was proven the shooting of Michael Brown was a justified shooting and to this day we still the ""Hands up Don't shoot"" chat. These protesters don't want justice, they want to see any cop who happens to shoot a black man, taken out and hung."
This stuff is really getting old. There is so much to say about this subject......I will sum it up the only racists I know are black.
"cause you agree, lmao?  One black person and you've got your validation?  hahaha

woof!  woof!"

Dressing up as someone who's black is the same as dressing up as a Nazi or a KKK member?  I'll bet that makes black people feel good."
"Keep it up, as I and many others I know are using our rights to completely tune you out and will continue.  There is not over 500 killings in Chicago almost all black men.  So get to the places that are truly in trouble and walk the streets, donate some of the average 1.4 million that football players make to improving the communities that bred the killings.  To disrespect our flag, and as a combat veteran who has problems from my service it makes me very angry and completely shuts down any willingness to help.  So go ahead all you privileged clowns stay at the circus of the NFL and like Ringling Brothers you will go out of business."

Just another reason along with their lopsided justice, crappy food (used to be the best burgers in Town not any more), pathetic service, (last time I went to Spur a year ago it took three waiters before I got one that spoke English I could understand), to boycott them. This proves that they do not care 1 bit for the safety and well being of children, they do nothing when kids get slapped, but shout at a black person and BAM your banned, and now they let kids into smoking areas............

"People who advance lies as truth as prone to tell lies themselves.  Black lives matter is a joke told by left wingers who want to take over the water and diarrhea falls.  Yes, 10 time a day spewing vegan diarrhea still stinks, no?"
And that is what black people do the world over.
"Of course it is about money for the NFL owners you dimwitted idiot! And soon it is going to be about money for the players when the networks slash the money they are paying to the league. How long do you think the average Joe would be employed if he walked around at his job fist in the air bellyaching to customers about social injustice? I think what 87% of America is learning is that blacks are never going to be happy. They can be making millions playing sports, making violent angry noise or as President and they are going to be obsessed with police doing their jobs. Instead of questioning why 13% of the population commits over half of murders they focus on a tiny handful of police shootings. The ten or so clearly unjustified police shootings of blacks each year hardly is indicative of a major problem. The millions of crimes committed each year by blacks is. The 72% of black children born out of wedlock is. There is your social injustice Brandon."

"For some of them? Forever. Because he makes ""libtards cry"". That's how low they have set the bar. I'm not kidding. It doesn't matter how much of an embarrassment he makes of himself and the country. It doesn't matter how often he brings us to the brink of actual nuclear war. It doesn't matter how much economic damage he does to his own base. It doesn't matter that he takes to Twitter and obsesses over things like people kneeling at football games when Puerto Rico is still mostly without power.


None of this matters, because much of his base are so nihilist that they don't even care if they are getting battered by his policies, as long as they think the ""blahs"", the women, the gays, non-xtians, the liberals, etc., are getting it worse and if they think tRump is erasing the black president's legacy.

Kennedy's protected a rapist & a murderer .... the list goes on .... All the way back when Abe Lincoln had an affair and children with a black slave ...... So I'm not sure if the anti Obama comments are because he is black or if you just hate Obama ... The Busch administration led us into war for WWMD that no one seemed to find. Then there is Nixon ....

Beside I think we as fans should take a knee every time one of these protesters drops a ball or fumbles! Why, they let us down! They should be perfect like they think our government should be.

"You make at least three significant mistakes.  First, you say:  ""Every time one mentions some crime done to Black people, the response offered is that they deserve it.""

But except among the most virulently racist, I never hear anything close to ""they deserve it.""  

""Families would be strong, if the parents were proper parents.""  You say this as though it's ridiculous to believe it.  It's not.  In fact, it's generally true, which is why we try to raise children who will model on good parents.  In general, proper parenting leads to strong families.

"Yes I do remember that ... when Obama won you couldn't find a Republican who would admit for voting for W not once but twice.  W drove the USA economy off a freakn cliff, started 2 'off budget' wars we are still fighting today ... YET ... the ONLY thing that mattered to 'em was that there was a Black man in office and the deficit was ALL OBAMA'S FAULT ... 

The deficit ONLY matters to 'em when a Black man is in office.  Now that Cheetolini is in office, you don't hear a PEEP from Repubs about spending EXCEPT when it is spending focused on USA citizens.  All domestic spending BAD.  All war spending GOOD.  The Military Industrial Machine is FULL of eligible voters who get their paychecks from Defense contracts, the irony isn't lost of myself that many of these suburban folks in 'republican' areas consider themselves Christian ... but sh*t howdy do they pray to the alters of money and war!!!

Wrong is wrong no matter how far back it happened...it was wrong for Tshaka to kill fellow Africans the same way it is still wrong today. It was wrong for verwoed to discriminate and kill black people an it is still wrong
"Nothing of what you claim is in my post.  Nothing.  A black person is obviously black to all casual observers.  Not always, but the vast majority of the time.  This fact does not apply to homosexual people.  When a bisexual person engages in homosexual activity, does this make them homosexual or do they continue to be bi?  My point is that, really, it is none of my, nor your, business.  Unless you observe the activity, or if they proclaim their sexual preferences, you have no way of discriminating against the person.  Black Americans do not have this ability to hide their status."

"""No one organization can address all of society's evils and shortcomings.""  

True.  But when blacks are murdered far more often by black civilians than by police, AND the organization that calls itself ""Black Lives Matter"" is virtually silent on the subject of black-on-black murder, I have to doubt the genuineness of the organization.  Reason would tell you that you'd hear BLM address this issue far more vocally and far more often --- if their main concern really were that black lives are being lost to murder."

In those cases, the employer will still be in the right if he can establish a bona fide occupational requirement for the decision.

""We were looking for and idiot, we found a drunk Irishman""

"It is very sad but these events are not really rare.  black bears are more prone to predatory attacks on humans not just in Alaska but in Canada also etc.  They have a more predatory instinct, I have lived among brown bears a long time here in Alaska and never witnessed what I have seen in blacks.  They are distinctly different.  A brown will attack and maul out of defense.  A black will attack, kill and eat you just because it wants too.  Every bear cannot be predicted in behavior and you can't exactly catagorize them all the same either, they all have different personalities the same as humans.  Killing four just to get one was a little much but I guess considering the terrain they felt they had no choice but I can also imagine how stupid they felt each time they realized they had the wrong one."

"Wait until after the inauguration.   Then you'll see real chaos.

Yes.   Universities will burn in violence as liberal arts students fight agonist Trump.  Cities across America will go wild in violent confrontations with law enforcement as the left has a temper tantrum. Blacks and Mexicans immigrants across America will riot and burn their own communities and loot stores.  Oceans of tears will flow on CNN."

The heroin junkies and methheads ramp up the theft and other crimes across the board for more dope to shoot up with and these career politicians pass laws to feather their own nest more efficiently, sneaking subtle legal maneuvers through the (Con)gress to make it easier for Big Pharma to peddle death in a pill, hooking thousands upon thousands on opioids that they eventually can't get for whatever reason, so they turn to heroin and meth.

Typical and expected hate from the completely intolerant left.  The black church that was vandalized down in Dixie with Trump spray painted on the side was done by a black man.  The left represents the most hateful intolerant violent sector of society yet they still whine about losing the presidency and both houses of congress.

Was Elvis your choir boy, the young one or the drug addled junkie talking to Richard Nixon?  PRESIDENT  Obama has received more death threats than any president in history.   He's divisive to you only because he's black.   

When is comes to reconciliation it requires a lot of humility, a lot of active listening, a lot of forgiveness.     How would you even begin to recognize that with your built in anger?

"HabFan410 - both sides can say they oppose racism but Trump has a long history of it.  Refusing to rent to blacks, outright racist statements against them, Mexicans and others, a campaign to delegitimize Obama as not born in America, stoking outrage against black youth accused (and acquitted) of rape - Trump is one ugly hombre on this matter and those cheering him on, I suspect, share many of his shortcomings."

What a joke.  Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country.  Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians.  They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything.  Pot calling the kettle black for sure.  The manipulation and hypocrisy coming from the democrats is mind boggling to say the least.  But we must understand they are drinking a kool aid that distorts the mind. Its called free lovism and situational ethics. Hail Hillary!!!!
"Give me a break..........Trump the protector of racists.

Did you not hear and ready what he said on the day of the tragic event and his subsequent comments.

Where was your editorial criticizing Obama and the other democratic leaders who applauded and hosts racists groups like Black Lives Matter and the ultra far left who won't tolerate free speech on campuses if the views don't support their own narrow approach.  No comment because you hypocrites!!

"Yes, the alt-right racists Trump caters to as well as Bannon, a proud racist, are fully responsible. 

Sorry, you don't believe that black lives matter as much as your life, which is the purpose of the movement against wanton violence against blacks.

So I brought up how Hillary For America, a Hillary Super PAC, was caught funding mentally challenged and homeless people to instigate violence from Trump supporters by standing near them, insulting their family and children, etc. until they got a physical reaction (imagine going to a black neighborhood and shouting racist things, you would get your ass kicked) or actually paying rioters to start chaos at Trump rallies such as in Chicago.

"Oh really? I've had death threats leveled at me on other platforms by the right wing. Oh, and constant ""jokes"" about shoving people in ovens from the same. I know prominent journalists, etc., get death threats and threats of rape (if they are women), especially if they are Jewish, black, gay, trans, liberal, etc.


In the past, I used to use my real name on various media platforms, until I started getting cons posting my real home address and remarks about visiting my family. I've had butthurt cons look up where I work, call there, and try to get me fired. And all because they were schooled by someone smarter than them.


Unfortunately, those behaviors were BEFORE that idiot was installed in the WH by the EC, now making these awful deplorables think they are now (even more) entitled to such behaviors.

"No Republican/conservative endorses violence? Really? Carpet bombing ring any bells? Or more torture including waterboarding from trump? Kill the terrorists' families (that's a war crime btw). Mexico is sending their rapists, murderers. Muslims shouldn't be allowed in this country. They're all terrorists. Sound familiar? Those targets Sarah put on Democrat politicians was just a fun thing to do, I suppose. Making every black person shot, into a thug doesn't encourage violence? Republicans use fear and hate as their MO. Dylan Root killed 8 black people just because they were black. Was the KKK blamed for that? Or was the response, ""he's mentally ill""? Please note Root was taken alive after killing 8 people. Minorities don't fare as well.

Two questions: 

1. What happened during and since the 60s to the two parties?
2. Why does TODAY'S Democratic Party get most of the black vote?"
Trump cannot stand the black guy bettering him. Obama should put out a statement daily until Trump has a stroke.
Probably because South Africans are so quick to trust black people.
"Yeah, just imagine if a black man did this. He probably would have been shot dead."
So you think it's okay to have black slaves and relegate them to the back of the bus and separate facilities and that it's okay for cops to profile and kill innocent blacks.
"It’s silly to dismiss criticism of President Trump for the times he’s a jerk or wrong unless that critic did the same for President Obama for the times he was a jerk or wrong.

Just as silly was the notion that any criticism of Obama was rooted in or the result of racism. To frame it that way, one could never be critical of or disagree with a black politician. Which was probably the goal."

UCT was once rated by the world as in the top 100 of all Western universities. No longer. No argument that when societies beliefs change, here on race, societies institutions are invariably also going to need to change to reflect new realities. Sure, here let students protest, make a noise ......... but not through burning, destruction, trampling the rights of others, breaking and looting, piles of shit on the floor. Please, promote a reasoned argument and deliver it with intellectual force.

That is not happening here. This arrogant, naive, destructive, backward, savage ill - informed performance,  is not acceptable in civilised societies. 

I don't expect any positive input from our failed government. But the silence from black society at large?Are they unaware of the ammunition given to those with negative racist attitudes? Are they not aware of the massive damage done to what is now their society?"
"I'm not sure what you are talking about but my point is, any black man getting self-righteous about violence committed by any group of people in the United States is ridiculous. Black people shouldn't act like saints above reproach, according to the ten commandments they are as flawed as the rest of mankind. A little truth would go a long ways for them but they prefer a fantasy narrative that exists in another world."

"Racism is more prevalent in black communities than anywhere.  I worked for several large corporations and we hired the best for the position,  Color or sex didn't matter - we wanted to make money and wanted the best.  Africa is primarily black and contributes a whopping 1% annually to the world's wealth.  Blacks in the US are about 10-13% of thepopulati0n and contribute less than 4% of the economy.  However, they do suck dry the people who work and produce."
Are you saying black people are prone to violence over verbal slights? Sounds pretty racist.
Yes.  They fought and died so that black athletes have the right to protest racially motivated police violence.  We live in a Democracy...not a fascist police state.  So stifle it..!!

The black woman said nothing in reply, but there was an acknowledgment in her eyes that she had heard me. Had she wanted to, I have no doubt that she was capable of responding on her own.?"" 

This is found documented in her article, ""Young Facists COLONIZE PORTLAND""

She also uses her lack of class to say that there is still violence and ""It’s home-grown, native-on-native."" 

Also in the comments section of her article is this awesome comment by her about wanting to vote for Trump to scare people--- I mean guys how can this lady be racist?! hahahaha she is in denial about it though.

Pathetic!  Do you see those kneeling JOCKS?  they are MULTI-,millionaires, I'm paying them to play a GAME, and they are dissing our flag.

"Baltimore was indeed an example of BLM. BLM is a racist organization filled with violent people. They use every black death by cops as a poster child for their violence hate and rhetoric.

"I agree that Hillary has worked hard. Can you name any of her accomplishments as Sec. of State? Can you name any legislation she initiated that helped women and children?

She has called women trailer trash and bimbos that just happened to been involved with her husband. She is a stellar example of progressive policy. Write in Bernie Sanders, please!!"

Hate crimes against Muslims, blacks and other visible minorities have skyrocketed throughout North America because the man in the White House who has given them license to do so. The very day the world is sent into chaos because of Trumps Muslim ban from 7 countries that the Cato Inst. says are responsible for 0 American deaths (but excludes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE who are responsible for hundreds / thousands of American deaths because  Trump  has businesses there)  this tragedy occurs.

What a joke. Democrats and Hillary made a statement about sexual predators when they voted in favor of Billy being elected even though the knowledge of the mans sexual deviance was laid out to the entire country. Democrats make a statement in favor of gross sexual perversion when they support and defend gays and lesbians. They make a statement about sexual perversion when they agree that a sexually deviant woman should be allowed to kill her own baby. They made a statement to the entire world when a transgender spoke at the democratic convention setting the example for all of our children that law and order does not matter and your feelings trump anything. Pot calling the kettle black for sure. The manipulation and hypocrisy coming from the democrats is mind boggling to say the least. But we must understand they are drinking a kool aid that distorts the mind. Its called free lovism and situational ethics. Hail Hillary!!!!

Republicans, on the other hand, were happy to schedule a vote. GOP aides said they planned to move to table Green’s resolution, killing it outright.""

For a minute there I thought Wasilla was becoming more tolerant by electing a Black guy.

"So blacks and gays are now targeting the police. Perfect. As if that is going to change any respect those groups have for one another. It's only going to rule out the support and assistance the police have given to these groups. 
Next time a black or gay person needs police support, good luck with that. The police should just ignore both communities and let them fend for themselves. Black crime in the northwest and northeast of Toronto should just be allowed to fester. The police now have a license to only deal with and address when these groups commit criminal acts against other communities. Hopefully this will reduce the high cost of police presence in the black communities. Let them rot."

"Poor Hillary, a bitter, crooked woman who cannot get over her loss. This is a woman who has no accomplishments and who used the fawning liberal media to build her up and erase her corrupt activities. But the American people saw thru all of it, and rejected her. Liberals, especially Hillary divide people along racial, religious and regional lines among others. Then she was beaten by the black guy (obama) and realized that blacks coalesced around Blacks because they are the most racist ethic group.  But women do not all adhere to gender politics. Blacks and gays are higher up on the liberal  totem pole than women. Hillary, the most unoriginal politician in the public eye, uses only focus-group tested cliches. There is no core, to this woman. She is as corrupt as they come."

"In a recent political speech, Hillary Clinton spoke about the Syrian situation in which she said she was going to enforce a no fly zone in Syria. But first, she would have a discussion with the Russians, who have already made it clear that they would shoot if the U.S. did that. So, Clinton would be risking a war with the Russians if elected President and enforced a U.S. no fly zone in Syria. What would Mr. Dion think about that? Enforcing sanctions, and going along with the U.S. on their Syrian policy. As for the Crimea, Russia took massive casualties there during WWII, but as Kruschev was a Ukranian, he gave the Ukraine status as an independent state, which resulted in the Black Sea fleet being based outside of the Russian federation, and to say the least, this was simply not acceptable to the Russians, and that is completely understandable for those with any appreciation of history. That would exclude Mr. Dion, who is incapable of rational thought."
"Wrong?  No; he said they're bigots.  

And that's not an unusual frame of mind for those who voted for Clinton.  Disagree with them on gay marriage and you're a homophobe, no matter that you said we should love gays.  Disapprove of abortion and you're a bigot.  Disapprove of certain forms of affirmative action or BLM or illegal immigration, and you're a racist.  Express conservative views on a college campus and you get hauled before a student board for hate speech.  These are so-called ""liberals.""  And they wonder why they lost to a slug as bad as Trump.  They have no imagination.  Literally.  They cannot imagine that mainstream America, which does not accept most of our cultural rot, would see Trump as the lesser of two evils.  They live in a cultural bubble, all tatted up and pierced, glorifying the ugly, hating beauty and God, hating Natural Law, having their abortions and marrying gayly, all without a clue.

"Even if eating meat gave us immortality, I feel unnecessarily ending the life of another precious living being is immoral. The law is on your side at the moment but denying women and people of color equal rights, for example, was legal at one time as well. The issue here is you feel your happiness and life is more important than the many lives of other animals that you are killing. I doubt the life of any human is worth the unnecessary suffering and death of our animal friends. The key word there is""unnecessary"" and in almost every case killing others is now unnecessary in this modern world."
"Go with the Donald then.  Continue to be distracted from what is important.  Ignore the fact that the Donald is the number one liar in the history of this country.  Black Lives matter is not about murdering cops, they are about not having young blacks murdered by fascist thugs."
Just your atypical african cesspool.
"Blacks, no other word is needed."
"Where exactly are you seeing ""peaceful"" coming into play here when these idiots are carrying baseball bats to a ""peaceful"" protest?????  A black woman who stood as an advocate for anti bullying shoved a 75 year old man down on the ground and cracked his head open because he said all lives matter. This is no longer peaceful protesting. This is ignorant mob mentality at work here. They've taken a page from the lord of the flies. They aren't proving anything but how foolish they are."
Since everyone is avoiding the elephant in the room.  Was the shooter a black man?
"Few comments raise to the level of stupidity as your's does Mark.

"Trump never said all Mexicans are rapists.

http://www.breitbart.com/live/vice-presidential-debate-fact-check-livewire/fact-check-donald-trump-not-call-mexicans-rapists-criminals/

Trump did not say anything against gay marriage.  In fact, he did say he ""is fine with it.""   He has said *nothing* opposing gays or lesbians.  He said the gay marriage issue is ""settled,"" meaning he does not oppose it.

Trump said TG people should ""use whatever bathroom they want."" (source:  NYT)

Trump never said ""Black people are moochers.""

You don't even have your facts straight on what Trump has said.    Not even close.   So I  find it even more hard to believe you have powers to read other voter's minds."
"You may have to forgive liberals being a little hysterical, but Trump has said a lot of racist and insensitive things. It's funny how character, morals, the things a person says, the views a person has seemed to matter so much just a short time ago! It seems it didn't take much to jettison these ideals from the minds of religious and conservative voters. Racist things Trump has said are easy to find:
 “Black guys counting my money! I hate it. The only kind of people I want counting my money are short guys wearing yarmulkes… Those are the only kind of people I want counting my money. Nobody else…Besides that, I tell you something else. I think that’s guy’s lazy. And it’s probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks,”  
“When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending people that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists…"
"Compared to what blacks do to blacks, the cops are nowhere near ""slaughtering"" numbers."
This isn’t PC either but it’s the truth:  I’m half nigger!
Are the cops out there murdering black people? The media sure thinks so.
"That's out of context. Clinton got more than 90% of Black votes. If you read trash, your brain becomes trash. There was no conspiracy. Politics is hardball, that's all. Bernie didn't lose significant votes because of any Clinton campaign tactics. Clinton won because more people trusted her. 

When are you going to write an intelligent comment? Something that shows common awareness of reality, and not some propaganda you've been fed?"
what is with all the crazy black women in govt???
"No, it means more to a black person because of history, but it is a derogatory remark to anyone,trying to call them stupid. Get over it, some things are more hurtful to people of different races. We are a nation of history, some good some bad, just how it is"
"Tell that to those blacks murdered by police. Hard to make something of yourself if you're dead, racist."
"Look for more black me to be shot in their beds, and for more cops to be shot."
"Black, gun, death penalty !"
Barack was as big a racist as Trump.....blaming the murdered police and making excuses for those blacks who murdered them.
"He probably felt like he was personally included in the racist comments that have since been deleted that ""thehighway"" posted lumping all black Americans in with these asshats. If I was black I would have done the same thing."
"I would, but he might kneel !  Naw, only if the person is black..."
Blacks are killing blacks at record numbers vs. crime against blacks by other races. This is all BS because blacks refuse to take responsibility for their own savagery.
"Did she ever figure out where the ""Country"" of Africa is? And, wait until she discovers there are black people there."
"All of that and blacks are still poor, illicit drugs are everywhere, health insurance premiums have sky rocketed, school graduation rates continue to decline as do test scores, our country is respected less than ever and the ME remains a war torn sh*thole. You have to be a dope or dope smoker to celebrate that."
The Portland police have a long history of failing to protect and serve black people. Move along. Nothing to see here. It could be worse. They might have killed the woman for defending herself.
"This is mass ridiculousness.  

Black people are rather shallow to believe they have exclusivity on slavery.  Anyone who believes that Black people have exclusivity on slavery isn't very well educated or knowledgeable in world history.  It still goes on across the globe to this very day and it can be any race or color of people."
"Google ""Tom Rogan"" ""president bush""... Yup, you're a hypocrite. Does the double standard apply to all Democrats, or only black ones?"
men performing drag of women is a type of black face
Must be the black caucus doing this because there so stupid they still believe that the progressive socialist liberal demorats propaganda
men performing drag of women is a form of blackface
I capitalized the word black & you are Deflecting from your error that Black slaves were not people.  An error on your parti
"Indeed, you long for the days of the telegraph, a time, coincidentally, when blacks knew their place, right?"
"the other night I was out for dinner with my wife and friends, unfortunately my best friend brought his rich ignorant brother-in-law and sister with us . His brother-in-law made some ignorant comment about black people and my wife hammered him calling him a ignorant racist, and that he should keep his mouth shut. I have never been so impressed by my wife! We need more people to be so brave. I hate racists! Sadly they make their comments and seem to think that others agree with them. How pathetic."
That's all well and good but when it's all the blacks in the sports taking the knee and raising  their closed fist...remember the Black Power salute?...then it's them who are creating and dividing our country....it'll all end when they stop doing this crap...
You equate the Left with being black... what is wrong with your brain?
and this is why the socialist left never said a word when ISIS AND THE TALIBAN desecrate Buddhist statues and temples and blow up christian churches.....We need to rid ourselves of the scourge of liberal socialism immediately. I DEMAND THE ARREST OF THE SOCIALIST BLACK BIGOT SENATOR XBXTXCH FROM MISSOURI WHO IS CALLING FOR THE ASSASSINATION OF OUR PRESIDENT.....PUT HER IN JAIL NOW......AND SHUT DOWN THE ISLAMIC TERRORIST SYMPATHIZERS IN THE MEDIA.
"So the side that has repeatedly been racist as hell is now trying to play the race card for black people?

Are you kidding me? Are you even serious? 

Just so you know ""It is too much power to avoid eventual oppression of the masses"" this is paranoia.
It is a mental illness. You are mentally ill if you think the government is coming for your guns and you can do anything about it, so just give them up, you already failed the mental welfare check."
Did the black slaves have guns in your made up world?
"""Nazi boneheads deserve being punched.""
===========
No one ""deserves"" to be punched. Assault and battery is a crime. Simply being a Nazi is not. Those who resort to violence or who think that violence is justified simply by what another person believes or says.....is worse than the Nazi.
-
Anyone who punches a Nazi simply because he is a Nazi is no better than someone who punches a black person simply because he is black, or who punches a gay person simply because he is gay."
I recall Nanakuliboss recently trash talking Florida because tourists have perished while vacationing there.  Talk about calling the kettle black!
"It's our police killing blacks!  Why......why.......it has to be, doesn't it?"
Blacks oppress themselves!
What's the difference between the two? Oh I know - Hitler was more polite to black people.
Construction sites are the perfect place for an ICE party.  Now is the time to cut-off welfare to all low end scum and put them to work.  Time to get blacks to work and off handouts.
"Actually they refused to make a conjecture about the electoral impact. If Clinton had made Booker VP, the Obama-only black voters would have come out and we would not have an idiot president."
"Some of us ARE close, very close, to 'people of color', but have never been invited to THEIR homes. Are you in any way qualified to make a statement like this? You're certainly not speaking for me! Grow up Lackey, then shut up..."
"What a pinhead Trump is. Instead of being concerned about the anthem or the flag why isn't he concerned that African American people are still going through horrendous treatment 60 years after Little Rock and other segregation era policies. 50 years after the Black power salute at the 1968 Olympics and these people still have to go through this.

That's what the concern should be, not about the stupid anthem or flag. How ignorant does your president have to get before you clueless folks who back him  tell him he's a fool and a complete embarrassment to the USA."
"Wait till they find out she is a black transsexual , then watch them spin"
"So, you are calling Trump Hitler or his programs influenced by Hitler and the KKK?

There is nothing in the executive order that remotely suggest killing of Muslims or Blacks.  It is your brainwashed ideas put into your head by Obama/Clinton/Fake News, et. al.

I won't waste my time trying to answering any more of your ""follow the donkey leader"" brainwashed ideas."
"Joop - Its his ego saying: ""Blacks cant be THAT bad !"""
"""Americans will never accept that blacks are people.""

It's obvious you don't know anything about Americans. You may consider exploring outside of that crowded city block where you reside."
"Thank you for moving me into your opposition. From this point on, screw black people... I don't care anymore. I'm sick and tired of your crap... never again will I support you."
"I reject, completely and absolutely, your pathetic liberal diatribe as to why President Trump should not be invited to be Notre Dame's commencement speaker.  Your rationalization that Obama , in spite of being an open advocate and proponent for abortion, is more worthy than President Trump because he is black and has positions  'not that far out of the mainstream"" is spectacular in its absurdity.

It sicken and disturbs me that you are associated in any way, shape or form with the Catholic Church - perhaps you could find another 'faith' more accommodating to the mental masturbation you spewed above."
"""they said, their presence to some black, gay or transsexual people was seen as threatening.""

Oh really, when a dangerous homophobic, racist nutter in the pride parade loses his steam and starts a brawl, who do these blacks and LGBT think will be the first in line to help bring the nutter to justice? Unicorns? Fairies? Tupac Shakur?"
"Of course the NFL wins the lawsuit, but NFL loses as this drags on in the media with black activist groups talking up the theory-conspiracy of collusion.  Black victimhood rolls on with the NFL on defense."
"Scumbags the lot of them!  You can pretty much guess what race these ""assistants"" are given the Gupta's predilection towards black employees and staff.  There will be no surprises as to how the ANCWL will react to this given their track record during Zuma's rape trial.

All of this just attests to the character of these cretins.  The proverb ""birds of a feather......"" just screams in ones face.  I'm starting to feel physically assaulted by the actions of these scumbags.  For the love of god will something just give already???  These cretins need to be run out of the country before there is absolutely nothing to save."
Where was tRump before he became an un-presidential candidate?  It was reported by a number of media outlets that blacks who worked in his casinos were order to stay out of sight anytime Trump and his then wife Ivana visited the casinos.  Come on black voters:  fool you once shame on you.  Fool you twice double shame on you.
"Because Trump is a brazen racist and bigot, his problem about the news media isn't so much that there is anything false there; rather it is because the news reporters are Latinos and Blacks. That's his real problem and the same problem he had with President Obama. Obama didn't do anything for America; Obama was not born in America, etc., etc. That's what makes him angry."
"""Reported"" by who? What ""document""?

Why are you talking about Martin Luther King? Did Moore try to get in his pants, too? What is your point? Are you saying that its OK for Moore to be a pedophile if Martin Luther King got it on with a bunch of women?

The statues argument is the most baffling to me. Taking down statues of confederate traitors because they literally celebrate racism and slavery is not equivalent to taking down statues of a man who championed tolerance and equality. Even if your fantasy story is true about King, its not relevant to his achievements. The confederate traitors' statues are literally trying to rewrite history.

Basically, you are a racist who thinks that if a black guy does something bad, that makes it OK for Roy Moore to be a pedophile."
"I find Trump despicable.  The people who listened on Trump's side of call, other than Trump, did not disagree with Rep. Wilson's response.
Your immediate turn to calling someone a greazy black sister indicates that you use race as a characteristic.

Don't bother to write back, not big on corresponding with racists."
Why is everything always a racist issue especially to black bigot politicians? Gen. Kelly was just calling a spade a spade.
Yet you protest the use of a death penalty on a black guy that shot up a chucky cheese's.   /sigh at more liberal hypocrisy.
"Hey, he has a right to free speech, okay?  So, really, the ""lefties"" are denying free speech and they are the real fascists here!  Never mind that he says Jews, Blacks, Latinos and a host of other people are inferior.  It's okay because it's his opinion, right?  And everyone is entitled to express their opinion!  So if you try to shut him down, it's really YOU who are the fascist.
Or, see Sir Karl Popper's essay from 1946 on tolerating intolerance.
Why the hell would a University host a scumbag like him?  Is he actually going to contribute to the academic environment of the place?"
"Oh FFS, this sh*t's never going to end. And the irony that the loons miss is how none of this, not one of their stupid, Marxist, Taliban-like 1984 idiocy will do a single thing for one black person. They'll still kill each other in urban cities, still resort to crime over education, and still have most of their children out of wedlock, born into poverty. 

Why do ""we"", the majority of reasonable Americans, continue to tolerate this crap, or worse enable it via silence?"
"Lol last comment gone ill post another revised one here goes

"Was that before a black man went to an English court in Virginia and got it to ""award"" him, a former black indentured servant as a life-long  slave? (In the 1600's?  The 1st documented ""slave"" in the American colonies?) There were free blacks who owned black slaves.  Slavery was economic, not racial.  As for the 2nd amendment, neither the government nor the Constitution grant ""rights"". The Constitution lists the most important, which is directing the government to guarantee and protect them, nothing more or less! Man has had the natural right to self protection since the dawn of time.  And if you're referring to ""stealing"" a country (I'm assuming vis a vis the ""indians"") they weren't indigenous, they also came from somewhere else....and eliminated the peoples here before them.  Perhaps you should apply your same standards to the daily massacres committed BY blacks ON blacks in all  liberal controlled inner cities, like Baltimore, Detroit, Chicago, etc.  liberals are such hypocrites."
"It is amazing how stupid and cowardly tancredo is and he got elected several times.
He was a draft dodger.
He knowingly hired illegals.
Even when pointed out that he had illegals, he did nothing to stop it.
Now, he thinks that first amendment applies to his wanting to force a company to hire a group that is about racism ( the illegal aliens is a front since they only care about Latinos, and blacks ).

Have to say, that I hope he runs on constitutional or even the Nazi party. Both are applicable to him."
"While the PPB shows serious  signs of racial discrimination, I don't see that as 'institutional racism' as much as it is fear by the police of being killed in the crossfire while the blacks continue to kill each other over drugs, prostitution and 'disrespect' by other blacks.  

Hard to blame the police of any color when the blacks are killing 6-year old girls in their beds in gang-related drivebys.  

Or to blame the police when the blacks are killing each other outside local strip clubs. 

Unless you are an apologist for criminals, of course."
"Bigot, racists birds of a feather flock together huh Black?  Go peddle your hate somewhere else.  The KKK lives in the Lower 48.  I'm sure they have an opening."

The traitorus acts of the Billionaire Class led by the Koch family, Oil Monopoly, Republican and Democratic Parties, Wall Street/Financiers.  The picture of a German president with tiny fist upraised like a spoiled child as he can't figure out whether to raise it in a Black Power salute or extend it for a full Nazi projection.  The fist ready to descend on the nation as it opens to grab every economic element available for the final looting envisioned by the Billionaire Oligarchy.  All courtesy of a brainwashed, manipulated stupid populace actually believing the words of this traitor.  Let the Women's March begin the revolution to take back the nation from the greedy fists of these worst traitors in the history of the nation."

Good for the IRR. Maybe those fascist middle class UCT black students - especially that idiotic one with the 'Decolonised Science' rubbish - might actually learn something from this.

Is racial injustice the black on black crime so rampant in Chicago?  Is racial injustice twice voting for a black president?

"""...You are saying that extreme black on black violence and carnage is not news for the MSM.

No, you're saying that to create something out of nothing.  If one isn't smart enough to dig deeper than the fluff that's thrown in their face by biased news media (which exists on ALL sides), then they're probably an idiot and not worth talking to.  

The problems in Chicago do not preclude the problems in Charlotte, the idiocy of Trump, any extreme left wing group that supports racist behavior, or any reprehensible behavior at all.  Even a person of average intelligence can consider many issues without having to exclude the others.  

The problem we're dealing with here is that those with questionable behavior immediately deflect and try to point at problems elsewhere, and those that support them do the same.  Reality is Trump is a racist who is supported by racist morons and he didn't have the courage to call them out, just as many other politicians have done."
But 16 blacks lawfully shot by cops across the whole country is the real problem
"Stop letting such a thing as your skin colour define you.   You are not marginalized unless you think you are.   I certainly would never marginalize you nor anyone I know.

"Nah, the racists just got very, very #triggered by having a black man in office. Obama was grace under pressure and bent over backwards (too much if you ask some) to his opposition.

Africa itself has for a thousand years been home to millions of Moors, black peole who aren't Aryan and who are welcome as pilgrims to Mecca. What is obvious is that those in America who hate Muslims for whatever reason (and I include you, dogs, among the bigoted haters) are the real hateful, bigoted, ignorant sociopaths, people who murder peaceful Muslims out of sociopathic hatred. Such people don't know what it means to be an American."
Pshaw!  Rush isn't racist--he just LOVES little black Dominican boys!
Well the license to not only kill black people was signed with the Philando Castile murder nut now the license to hunt black people up and put them in prison has been signed. Stop and frisk is back with a new name. Lynch them with bullets is the law.

"Just this weekend a black lab charged me and was about 3 seconds away from eating lead. Luckily it listened to its owner coming up the trail. If you own a dog restrain it, if it's the least bit aggressive or it's your fault for its death. I own 2 dogs and they are always leashed when people are near even though they are very calm friendly dogs."
The discrimination against males in colleges is based on Title 9 interpretation by the Democrats in the position of power that are controlling 100% of Higher Education. The ratio of males to females in colleges is dropping from 4 to 6 to 3 to 7. It will lead to the demographic disaster as Men tent to marry down and women to merry up. A college educated female will not marry a plumber or HVAC technician. Virtually all college educated females will remain spinsters or will be forced to whore around for companionship. One only needs to examine African American marriage patterns to see the future. Why would a college educated Black MD marry an ex con?
"Why, would naming a show called Dear Black People be racist??"
"That view is also shared by many black Americans, both Trump supporters and detractors, you racist"

">>Yet in the face of that disturbing evidence,

.
Evidence to what?

Blacks and Jews are the groups most targeted by hate crimes. The two-fold increase is +20 incidents, if i remember correctly.

The increase comes largely in the ""against property"" group.

Does this diminish any of the crimes?  No.

Does it constitute a 'quell'? No.

60 idiots threw a slur, or felt 'macho' by vandalizing a mosque, or pulled Muslim woman's headscarf (these mostly done by teenagers).

That constitutes calling Canadians Islamophobic?"
"How many times have we heard the Left (Democrats/Liberals) in the United States, Canada and worldwide state repeatedly, not to hate Muslims, Jews ,Gays, Blacks and just about every other part of humanity?! How many times?! How many times?!

Yet, how many times have we heard Democrats/Liberal politicians, world political leaders of every stripe, the news and broadcast media, talk show hosts, T.V. and movie stars and private citizens both in the United States of America, Canada and around the world spew hatred and condemnation toward American President Donald Trump feeling that is all prim and proper?!

Like the Islamic terrorists who are radicalized by I.S.I.S. in mosques all over the world, those people who I have mentioned above that hate President Trump to such an extreme, are certainly responsible for radicalizing the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson. You have fueled this hatred and indignation by the words from your own mouth.

Yes, you asinine hypocrites have blood on your hands."
"Black Lives Matter is for people who get shot and killed for simply for being black, or when LEO uses excessive force when dealing with them because of their skin color. BLM is not for drug dealing criminals that choose the thug life to scream poor me, I'm going to jail because I'm black. No, you are going to jail because you are a criminal."
Ice is not black. Fact
"Apparently if someone is black, the LEOs are not allowed to protect anyone else from his butcher knives.

What a farce."
"Who exactly is ""them""?  Terrorists?  If you could identify and find them, you could jail them.  But, I suppose you really mean people of brown skin or Muslims, and are just trying to hide your cowardly closet racism behind generalities."
"How blind are those who will not see. The ANC seek a worthy woman to succeed Zuma as president. From her comments I would say that there are few, if any, women within the ANC who can hold a candle to this firebrand. Yet now, because she pleads with her colleagues to stand with her and the people of SA against a corrupt, rapacious tyrant, his greedy cronies and handlers, she is hounded, derided, threatened and kicked out of her job, when the party should be putting her forward as a prime candidate for Zuma's job! How much more filth must the ANC smear itself with before they realize how much they stink?"
"“Demonstrators shouted slogans such as ‘black lives matter’”

BALDERDASH!

If black lives were not dirt cheap - - if black lives REALLY mattered to the blacks themselves - - two things not true now WOULD be true:

[1] young women would demand the fathers of their children marry them and remain faithful BEFORE the arrival of the children

[2] they would demand that Planned Parenthood  - - which deliberately locates its for profit abortion mills in high density black communities to kill as many black babies as possible - -  be de-funded and abolished."
"What a sadly narrow view of the world.  Nothing in this letter but Fox News half-truths.  Obama took policemen to task who shot un-armed people because they were black.  Jumping from a patrol car and gunning down a 12 year old boy playing with a toy gun IS an act of stupidity, or murder.  And if that doen't bother you then you have no soul."
Wby don't you educate your redkneck self. How do you know he was high? Because someone said it on here or was it since he is black you just assume he is high? Do us a favor and go jump off a cliff hick
"You're wasting your time posting statistical research, Gegonos.  Bigots like Black and Craigers don't care about facts.  The only fact that they seem to know is that they hate anyone with brown skin, that are homeless, or live in rural Alaska."
"Wow. Just wow.  Black women feel more pain than this pig would ever be able to endure. Take it down. (And the speculum is an instrument of torture in the hands of most doctors, particularly the males.) They also say certain parts feel no pain. To this day. Surprise, man beasts!"
"Even if he DID call the cops, against her wishes, they couldn't have done anything about it. Reporting a crime against a third party, free of corroborating evidence - of which there was none - is not actionable as it's investigative-hearsay. It's not like seeing a crime on the news and saying 'I know that guy, I'm going to call in a tip,' that's offering third-party information to aid in an investigation. Here, there wasn't an investigation, as there was no report of a crime.
Kizsla is salivating over every purported act of impropriety around CU. Could you imagine his mock outrage had CU taken against Tumpkin, based on the available information: ""CU's racist policies call for black coach to be fired based on unsubstantiated reports!"" Or, ""CU deprives black coach of due-process!"" The slander/libel lawsuits that Tumpkin would have (regardless of his actual involvement) had would dwarf the current allegations - and Kizsla would have been drooling the whole time. He's a pathetic individual"
So trans-gendered people cannot defend the US and fight? Used to say that about black people and women. Discrimination is discrimination.
"Here's another comment for DM. You have just now given me some stupid black marks for marking others' comments as being 'civil' that you think aren't. Well, this is a warning for you. Fix your bloody stupid marking system up, or I will bugger off anyway. It's ridiculous."
"Ignorant millionaire athletes supporting a false narrative and a Black Lives organization that is both racist , violent and Marxist.
I will support everyone's right to free speech on their own time but using the NFL and national TV to disrespect my flag and the flag of a country that has done more to advance freedom and true equality then any other is malignant stupid. There is no epidemic of police violence against black men, there is an epidemic of violent black men."
"It might be considered important - but is it really? Maybe it's because the woman is black, or Muslim, or has a ""save the whales"" bumper sticker, or even a Confederate flag on her bumper. The point is - it's not OK to run people over because of their beliefs. Trump seems unable to condemn such behavior convincingly.

OTOH - yeah, this story is incomplete. Maybe she crossed in front of him while he was driving and he just made a stupid comparison."

"The Trump years are a waste of four years. Trump is not great. What is notable with Trump is he is a incessant liar and not particularly competent. Mexico is not paying for his wall. And his failure to come up with a viable alternative to Obamacare was a reflection of his lack of knowledge and leadership on policy matters. Ryan and McConnell wrote the legislation behind closed doors rather than holding open Congressional hearings. Trump was wasting his time golfing and watching television since it was an embarrassment for him to talk publicly or privately about the subject given how stupid he is. Trump bought his college degree. He did not earn it. 

Trump is not inspirational and lacks legitimacy. Most of his opinions are driven from his racist point of view that blames immigrants, blacks, and Mexicans as the source of all troubles. So it is not surprising that he supports the Klan and its attempts to rename itself as the alt-right. And he failed to win the popular vote."
"The officers were petty in stopping her. Once they realised the Black woman they profiled was the state attorney,  they began stuttering and stumbling over their words.

Take your racist ass on somewhere else with your bullsh*t analysis."

"Anybody know why Melania didn't put on a Pussyhat and march with the women?
   Because Melania is a man.

  Yes. Now the truth can be revealed.
   Melania isn't really Trump's wife. Trump has several secret wives stashed away in several Islamic countries.
 Melania is actually Trump's secret Minister of Propaganda. She's a front for the shadowy cabal of multinational billionaire oligarchs who have taken over the world with a master gender ideology.
    As the world knows, Trump hates women. He would never slow dance with a woman. But he dances slow dances with Melania because, as his Minister of Propaganda, he whispers to Trump what idiotic things he needs to say next.

  But seriously, I've never noticed any trolls online. Maybe here at the G & M the ""armies of watchdogs"" are doing such an amazing job of guarding against anything creative, humorous, genuinely passionate, or meaningful, I've been deprived of one of life's truly awesome excitements.

   But why do these mythical ""trolls"", if they exist, pick on women? Maybe because so few women are doing their democratic duty. So few women comment online it makes one mad wondering why women are wasting their opportunity to participate in democracy."

"Well of course it's okay today to be prejudice, it just has to be the right kind of prejudice.

Then you're all good."
"So a Christian can pledge allegiance to their religion first, but if a Muslim does then it's automatically more suspect? I'm not suggesting you explicitly said that, but inciting Sharia law or beheadings at the mention of Islam invokes that kind of double standard. As if Islam itself is to blame, not a complex mix if politics, history, and culture that leads to the extremes we see.

I'm trying to get at the core assumptions here, as to the kind of rhetoric I see as harmful and unfair in it's correlation. It's this general belief that peaceful devotion to Islam is fundamentally dangerous whereas devotion to more familiar religions is no need for alarm."
"It would be helpful if Catholic schools worked with other confessional and secular private schools (charter schools also), to oppose De Vos' goal of getting rid of public schools.  The former schools, Catholic being an admirable exception, can always raise the tuition so high,(so one can't attend in the first place), or make up ""rules"" about hairstyles etcetera ; that either keep POC, Blacks in the main, the ones who see more suspensions, detentions, exclusions from participating in extracurricular activities or more seriously barred from attending graduation ceremonies. 

Let's be clear that the return of Jim Crow or in reality depriving POC of education, healthcare, housing and jobs back to near slavery days is the goal of those in the Trump Administration."
"The divisions in our nation have been growing for over 30 years.  The black civil rights movement ended Jim Crow segregation but it did not end racism in the hearts of some--(some Southerners never accepted they lost the Civil War and though they went underground their hatred continued).  Then in the 1980s the NRA began(?) encouraging people to arms themselves and take the law into their own hands.  Conservative talk radio began encouraging and enabling people who could see only their own view to go public.   President Reagan said repeatedly that ""government was the problem""--(he could have said 'too much government is a problem).'  In the 1990s, after the Contract With America was presented and the GOP gained many seats in Congress, Newt Gingrich said ""the Republican party can't govern properly unless it controls all three branches of government.""  He was rejecting the working together and sharing of power that is at the foundation of our system of government."
"Funny? It seemed a serious statement to me, not a funny one. I have lived and worked in every region of the US, and though Oregon has considerable racial diversity, it has few black people compared to almost everywhere except Alaska. I also agree that housing is too expensive in Oregon, and in that regard California is worse.

But the point I was making is that the West and East Coasts export a surplus of money, and that the South and the flyover states get that surplus, thus are welfare states overall. Considering that, it would be painfully ironic if the federal government refused to return funds that originated primarily in the productive states that subsidize the rest of the country.

Good post, thanks."
Much ado about nothing.  Protest in sports has been around for most of my life time.  I respected Muhamed Alii for his protests and so I respect these players for protesting cops violance against blacks.  The national football league would be making a big mistake if they tried to stop this.

"PBS is running a great six hour series on the first world war. I hadnt realized how short it was for the US- barely a year of active fighting. It was impressive how the US manufacting economy could turn on a dime to support the war.

Alas, Blacks were still disrespected and would have to wait a few more wars for full military integration."
"""As I enter my majority-adulthood life, I'm living in a nation that's never quite let go of its hostility towards women and people of color, especially black people.

I'm not a regular churchgoer anymore since my Christianity has taken a dramatic turn to the left, and I don't think I could sit quietly by and agree if conservative views were espoused again like they were back when I was in college.""

If you think, at your age, that this nation is hostile towards women and people of color, wait until you hit 65.  (I am almost 69.)   Our society wishes we old ones (female AND male) simply did not exist, if for no other reason than we tend to remind the younger ones that they'll be old someday too.  With that said:  I agree w with Maureen :  I loved my 50s and have REALLY loved my 60s.  I hope you do also."
"By the way, the RFRA (which is a Federal Law, and only applies to other Federal Laws, since it has been ruled as Unconstitutional as applied to the States in Boerne v. Flores) doesn't apply in the Masterpiece Cakeshop case.  The actual case law in this case is actually in a case called Employment Division v. Smith.  In this case, Justice Scalia (writing for the Court) stated that as long as a law is a neutral law of general appliciability, it does not violate the First Amendment's Free Exercise clause.

But let me ask you this one question.  Let's say that this wasn't about gay marriage, but was about Black marriage.  Should a baker who's a member of the Ku Klux Klan be able to refuse to serve Black people by claiming that it's against his religious beliefs?  If your answer is ""No, a black person should have the same right to be served in that scenario"", then you don't believe in an religious exemption to anti-discrimination laws."

"From me too, thank you...by all accounts Dallas is one of the best of the best and we should honor no only the extreme horror of the situation for the families, who like all families of police officers I've in fear each day as they see the officers go into the line of duty, for us and a civil society.  But to understand how and why they are better than too many others, and make this the expectation. As many say, freedom isn't free and those who serve, military, police and fire, and teachers, social workers, all the fiber of what makes a great community strive to assure we can remain free.

"If criminal behavior in the Black communities of Canada and The US  were in proportion to it's portion of the population,  3% and 8% respectively,  the number of police shootings would follow suit.

"In the 1800s, in some states in the USA, there were anti-literacy laws that specifically prohibited teaching Blacks how to read and write.  Meanwhile, in Canada, Sir John A.

In Ferguson many of those thugs were from out of town. They weren't even from the area, but they were robbing, burning, looting, etc. Once you get a mob-mentality running full throttle, it takes on a life of its own. Soros was counting on this. Don't believe me? Google his name and look into the nasty things he's done around the world, and who he bankrolls (HINT: Hillary Clinton  is only one among many). Don't blame all black people for the riots over the last couple of years. Blame the people ginning up troublemakers and turning them loose on society.

"I have sufficient faith in the average black South African voter to believe that they would not have been befuddled by a clear stand: ""Colonialism was bad but it had SOME good results.""

"what is Canadian culture ?  Until someone can tell me it is simply another way to say you are being prejudiced.  To me, it is an amalgam of 150 years which includes a whole lot of folks from places as diverse as Ireland and Scotland, to India to China and Vietnam and even the USA.  And hey, Africa and South America too.  So while we wait for your clear and concise explanation of Canadian culture, I will sit back at Timmies and enjoy watching the hockey with the Muslim kid from London On, (who fasts during Ramadan) playing for the Leafs against another pro team with a few black kids from Scarborough on it.  I hear Manny Malhotra just got hired by the Canucks.   Or maybe watch that Setoguchi kid from Taber play for the Kings.  Enough Canadian culture for you all?"
"I'm torn on this issue. We have had season tickets in our family for over 50 years. I'd like to express my disappointment in what the players are doing, morso the black power salute than the kneeling.

I support the players' right to protest, and am trying to figure out how to protest their protest. For the Raiders' game, perhaps I should sell the tickets to Raiders' fans. I could probably get a tax break for supporting people who are clearly suffering from mental illness. But then those seats are still filled. So maybe I can just burn the tickets and allow the seats to stay unused. 

Another idea is a campaign to engage the NFL sponsors.  I hate to go down that road as I could be considered an NFL sponsor as well.  When the sponsors signed deals, they had no idea that this would happen. However, if Bud Light suddenly lost a ton of sales, perhaps that would send a message. 

We are now considering the idea of giving up our seats next season, with regret."

"It is appalling to me that so many voters were so proud that we finally had our first black president. Then HRC whined at a rally that ""don't you want to see the first woman president?"" Race & gender should have absolutely NO influence on who gets our vote. Competence of the candidate should guide our fingers at the voting booth.
If we had a choice of a black like Ben Carson, or a woman like Carly Fiorina, neither of whom attempted to trade on their race or gender, but on their personal accomplishments and their voiced plan for their governments -that would have been a reasonable choice.
In our video game dominated society, the packaging of fantasies has replaced real life, for far too many Americans. The people who do focus on the realities of life are far more apt to become part of the 1%."

"seems discriminatory against age and race to only allow people to falsify gender designation on birth certificates.

after all, most teenagers identify as being older than 21 and would like to have the same rights as a 21 year old in purchasing liquor.

some people, rachel dolezal for example, identify as black and want to join and lead black organizations, or identify as hawaiian and want to attend kamehameha schools.

if you want to identify as something other than what you are, so be it, that's up to you. just don't expect me to identify you as anything other than what you were when you were born."

Many veterans claim to have served to protect American rights & freedoms.

How does this work?

Do the US Armed Forces function as some sort of giant civil rights organization?

Black people were still riding at the back of the bus after the big WWII victory.

Women were not allowed full voting rights at the end of WWI.

Were US troops sent to Vietnam so that Americans could be free to send letters to the editor?

Is there any case in which the US Armed Forces have been sent to distant lands on a mission to protect freedom of speech?

Is protecting freedom of speech even part of training scenarios?

The Department of Defense track record goes back to 1949. How many US wars have been won since then?"
"Well, don't let facts get in the way of your intuition."
"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.
Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.”
Ungrateful is the new uppity.
Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.
Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
"It USED TO BE a protest against police brutality against Blacks...see, now YOU don't even know what the original protest Kap was making.  Now it is about protests for Blacks in general, protest to support the First Amendment, tomorrow many more will probably do it to protest against Trump, what's next?  Are we going to need signs placed on each protesting player to know which issue they are personally protesting about?  Point being is doing these protests during the National Anthem is not the place to do so otherwise all of us should be kneeling because none of us believe 100% the same on every issue.  How many more issues will people use the National Anthem to protest their personal issue?  The National Anthem should be the one thing that is respected for the generations of people of all ethnicities who have fought and died for our country.  I guarantee that if we ask people in public what the National Anthem protest is for then many, if not the majority, will not say Police Brutality"
"No big surprise.  There will be a lot of initial interest – regular users will want to see if the quality is there, and novices might be curious enough to give it a try.

I think, though, that they ought to fix the price at least a buck or two below “street” value, since regular smokers rarely pay that.  They need to get to a point where the black market simply doesn’t pay – around 27% of the cigarette trade in Canada is under the table because of high taxes."
"Naturally, the Democrats want us to forget all that. They also want us to forget that almost every other racial and ethnic group has risen out of the Great Recession - largely thanks to the wealth effect of Federal Reserve and European Central Bank quantitative easing, not so much anything done by Mr. Obama or other Democrats - except for black Americans. But, of course, for Democrats, It does not matter that the long and sordid history of Democratic plantation-style paternalism - from Jim Crow to the welfare state - has not only failed black communities, but kept them dependent on Democratic party elites for morsels of beneficence, instead of on their prodigious homegrown wits and resources.

"Out of the 1,000 Hispanics who are registered to vote who were polled 770 would not vote for Trump. He is going to get crushed in CA, AZ, NM, NV, and TX. I'm pretty sure the black community is not a big fan of Trump either."
Might as well face facts and move on.  Not only blacks are discriminated upon. Make the best of it.
"Unthank was the first black man to graduate from the architecture school, and had a distinguished career. It seems strange to ask for color-blindness when these ""firsts"" are still recent history. I have a hard time imaging the strength needed by Unthank to be a ""first""... this letter asks that we ignore that."
"Please read the comment above  by john Tepton  regarding how the death penalty was applied and territorial days:
 Only four people were going to territorial government – two were Alaska natives, one was black, and one was an  immigrant from Portugal who didn't speak English. Things that  May sound fair and satisfying in theory are not always as clear, fair and satisfying when human beings turn theotied into practice"
You must be talking about South Africa because in this country the base salary for a starting NFL player is $540k.  There is no universe where black persons starting at salaries like that could even remotely be considered underprivileged or discriminated against.
"Trump rally ?

"The few blacks who came to Oregon to attend school are definitely a minority.  Times change, though.

When I was at Duck U Law School, there were only four women law students; now it's 206 male and 160 female. 

There were no blacks then; now there are 9.  And total minority is 67. out of the 366 total.  

The only other minority I recall when I was there was a guy who was Native American and he had already served as an Officer in a submarine and was also a CPA, so he kinda stood out!"
"You were an infantry officer in the Army, no fooling?

A black Air Force general commenting in the early 1970s about racial problems in the military, noting the disproportionately low number of incidents that the Marine Corps had even adjusting for service size, said: ""They don't have racial problems in the Marine Corps, they treat everyone as if they were black"". 

All out of tissues."
"The author is writing from inside the academic/activist bubble. By ""black America"" she means black activists -- a minority within a minority. Their views and resentments are far less important than she thinks they are. Trump was elected by a broad cross-section of Americans concerned about bread-and-butter issues. Those are his priorities."
"Native Americans held black people as slaves. My alleged great grandmother was taken as a slave-wife to a chief. One ancestor tried to defend a Protestant leader from the Inquisition of Charles von Habsburg who conquered the Aztecs. My Huguenot ancestors fled to America from the Catholics. Black Americans were drawn to Moses - the Abolitionist. I have proven Jesus was an Abolitionist who began the War of Liberation from Pagan Rome, thus, Pagans owned millions of slaves.  Judaism is a tribal religion that came out of pagan India. The days of the week are named after pagans. When the Jews lost the world war with the Roman Slave Master, Christianity was altered to appeal to Roman Pagans.  Did black slaves adopt the religion of their Native slave masters? http://atlantablackstar.com/2014/04/09/5-native-american-communities-who-owned-africans-slaves/"
They mentioned what kind of a police officer would do something like that but what about what kind of kid would attack a police officer.  All I can say is good thing the kids weren't black all hell would have broke loose.
"Actually I think the logic of BLM is quite obvious and compelling.  If you were to fill in what is implied in the shorter slogan, it would go something like this: All lives should matter, but historically in the United State Black Lives have mattered less (See slavery, Jim Crow, etc.), therefore we need to proclaim that Black Lives Do Matter also.  BLM does not at all claim that one race has privilege over another, but that all races should have the same privileges and rights that currently not all do."
"How do you know Kathy macadoo hates the president because he is black? You are accusing her of being a racist without evidence, shame on you. Obama care is not working out too well, 20 percent increases lack of choices for carriers. I think you need to tell the truth. Wish you would cite some sources of your hatred."
"Was I posted yesterday, it is interesting to note that under Session's watch only three black people have been appointed in Alabama for the federal courts. This despite the fact that black people make up over 39% of the population of that state. What underlines this reality must be Session's unconscious, if not conscious, attitude towards blacks in general."
"Alright, look, if a program is aimed at racial discrimination, does that make the program itself racist? In the case of affirmative action, those programs were designed to counter a racial bias in college admissions of primarily black students capable of doing the coursework but with lower test scores, generally thought to be the result of inferior K-12 schools underfunded because they are in poor neighborhoods. Remember, most public schools are locally funded, so rich neighborhoods have rich schools, poor neighborhoods have poor schools.

The intent of racism is to keep certain races down. Admissions criteria favor applicants from more affluent areas with better schools. In states where a third of the people are black, for instance, why is it that only a tenth or twentieth of public university admissions are black students? That is a racist result that causes harm to black communities and perpetuates poverty, a situation that's bad for our nation. That's why AA programs aren't racist."
"I don't  really agree with the notion that it is solely just men restricting women, since nearly half of all women are pro-life.  The fact is  less than 10% of abortions are due to health reasons. Also there is the dirty little issue of the astronomically high rates of abortion among the black and Hispanic population and the founder of PP openly wanted to eliminate blacks from America. Nearly 70% of black pregnancies are unintended, these hard facts that people aren't addressing. We are trying to address symptoms of greater societal problems rather than the problems themselves. Most abortions would not even have a need to occur if we brought back fatherhood, incentivized marriage strongly rather than single motherhood via tax incentives, home loan interest rates etc, and went back to promoting the basic common sense traditional grown independent adult ideas that our grandparents believed in."
"The headline keys on ""racially offensive"".  There is no evidence that the comments were made solely because the student was black.  Further there is no evidence that the black student is even a descendant of those subjected to the slave trade or is perhaps the product of modern immigration from an African nation.

While no question most people associate slavery with the North American slave trade - it is not beyond comprehension that the quip was made simply on the basis academic hierarchy rather than skin color.  In other words the remark could have just as easily been made to a student of another ethnic or racial background.

Surely an institution of higher learning and a graduate student at a leading university could take the time to determine if there was malice behind the remark or a pattern of similar conduct rather than simply seeking the safe harbor of political correctness."
"I've come to the conclusion you have your own issues.  What AlexZander was pointing out, correctly, is black people are vastly more likely to be killed by other black people than by a cop.  That does not mean there are no bad cops only that the cop killings are twig in a bonfire."
"Canada and and especially Ontario has lots of support groups and financial aid to many immigrants and newcomers to start and make something of themselves.  My relatives came from nothing, not even having shoes when they arrived in Canada and managed to provide for their families and make a path for their children to improve on their successful integration. Hard work and the realization no one can help you like you can help yourself.
When the majority of the gun violence is from the black community, maybe the investigation should start there and stop dancing around the subject.  At some point, with the social security net provided by this province, when the violence doesn't improve, we have to start looking at cultural behaviors as the root cause. I doubt many of the people participating in this behavior have 12 hours shifts at the factory to do before they go out and shoot up a street."
"Trump will continue to improve the Black community and elevate their economic situation regardless of whether they will help and support him or not. That is the earmark of a great President, something Obama just could not do because of his own racist views."
"For those who are upset about this form of protest, what would be acceptable.  If black people protest by gathering in the streets, you call them thugs.  If they protest by kneeling during the National Anthem, you call them somehow un-American.  What form of protest would you find acceptable?

Personally, the only problem I have with this protest is that with the exception of a few, the protest isn't about what they are protesting anymore, but about politics.  For those on the right, the conversation is ONLY about disrespecting the flag, for most on the left the conversation seems to be about the 1st Amendment.  It seems that the actual reason they are protesting has been lost in the rush to make this about politics."
"May I suggest looking at the polls between Trump and Clinton at realclearpolitics.  Trump leads only in state, Georgia.  Trump is a nativist.  He is trying to model the GOP into a nativist party.  As such he has lost the minorities including Hispanics and Blacks.  No candidate has ever won this way.  Look at history.  Trump will not win.  His splitting the voters is his doom."
"Incomes may have gone up if you count democrat Mark Zuckerberg of FACEBOOK fame's income.  Otherwise, democrat policies have left American cities and blacks and hispanic Americans living in a wasteland and a war zone.  Just ask the 6,000 people shot in Chicago in the last two years.  Or any other major American city. http://crime.chicagotribune.com/chicago/shootings/"
"Nope - not a dogma.  In fact the pope before John Paul II spoke openly about possibly ordaining female priests so we know, if only 2 popes ago, a Pope was publicly considering ordaining women to priesthood, and Jesus does not state we can treat women differently than men, which he didn't, then there is no scripture support to keep this abuse in place, and because John Paul II was told that he had no basis for making this exclusion a dogma, and that is why JPII didn't claim it was a dogma, nor could he because it doesn't have a basis necessary in scripture or historical agreement of all bishops, then it can't be a dogma.  

Doctrines and traditions have changed in our church history.  We used to own black slaves too and only 200 years ago.  Sin must be repented of whether in the form of tradition or doctrine or Jesus tells us he will deny we belong to him.  There is no salvation from Catholicism unless it is first Christian.  Also Pope Francis never confirmed that."
"Jet, Brooks has good reason to do so.

"Unfortunately, Obama didn't do really well in reconciling black issues either."

The analogy does not hold water.  My original reply was to a post that said He IS a dictator which of course he is not .... 
I have read plenty of your comments to know what side of the political spectrum you are on so saying ""I have voted for blah blah blah"" is akin to when a democrat says he cant be a racist because he has a black friend.  
If you think I cast my vote in the last election for Trump, you would be spot on ... He is not HRC and that in it of itself was enough, but beyond that the promise to appoint conservative Justices (which he has done) and repeal the monstrosity of Obama care were enough for me to vote for him, all his other faults not withstanding."
"Oh Jay, I couldn't disagree more! Hillary has throughout her life been a practicing church going Critian, she just doesn't wear it on her sleeve. But her record is consistent and clearly living the mandate Christians should follow, make a better life for the least of these.

"This isn't news. Former presidents have always retained their titles. If you wrote the same paper about Reagan, Clinton or either Bush, I stand corrected as to your motives, but as far as I can see, this only becomes a big enough deal to rant about when we give such an honor to a black guy."
"Funny how this keeps being framed as a left/right issue than a right/wrong issue.  I'm not black (well I'm black Irish, but so was O'Bama ;-) but I understand completely why some people might not want to honor those who kept their ancestors as chattel property.  The explicit purpose of displaying in the public square is absolutely intended to honor these figures.  Washington, Jefferson and Madison get a pass because they built the nation that ultimately extended more freedom and liberty to every citizen (still a work in progress).  Put the traitors to that nation in a museum, where they can be framed in an historical (i.e. accurate) context."
"And yet you keep supporting the party that has failed you miserably. You have been taught to blame the right wing citizens of this nation for all your woes. You are very good at the blame game, you are very good at looking at the past mistakes of the nation towards the blacks but you are blind to doing anything other then complaining about the past. How will that change anything? I will ask you again, other then throwing the race card and whining about the past, a past we cannot change, what are you doing to improve the situation for the inner cities? I can tell you what you have been doing wrong, continue supporting a party that has used the inner cities for votes without caring about improving their chances for a better life. Wake up Charles, quit being used."
"Agree. As a southern-raised conservative Christian who believes that God made all of us equal in our humanity, I find it very easy to understand why blacks would be deeply offended to see the Confederate flag.  Its defenders say it doesn't stand for racism, by those who fly it are not especially marked by their passion for equality, are they?  They say it stands for a noble cause --- resistance to Northern Aggression and the Right to Secession.  But what was the cause of that cause?  Slavery.  And that flag, if it ever had a noble significance, completely lost it during the civil rights era, when it was flown as an express symbol of resistance to the Equal Protection Clause.  It's meaning is clear enough, and it offends.  Agnikan is right:   If this flag DOESN'T offend you, you need a history and an ethics lesson.  And a lesson in basic Christianity and the meaning of empathy."
"Actually, the fact that he is black has saved us untold hours of posting here on the R-G.   No one has to listen to all the affirmative action posturing.  

He was hired based on his previous successes in turning around two other programs and his other abilities such as enthusiasm and recruiting abilities. 

Oregon's ""Rooney"" law didn't even have to get mentioned.

A coach, unlike some others at Duck U, is hired-and fired based on expected and actual measureable results.  If he doesn't succeed, he, just like Helfrich, will be looking for a new job.

That works just fine for me."
"The FREEDOM of Kaepernick to not stand with hand on heart during the playing of the national anthem is exactly what the flag represents.   

And the national anthem is a particularly relevant symbol for his protest of what he perceives as the unfair treatment of people of color in America.  The anthem was written by the slavery supporter Francis Key during the War of 1812.  During that war the British army enticed black slaves to join them in fighting their American masters.  This explains the last four lines of the third verse of the anthem...

"Tell me what else you know about 94% of black Americans because you hired a door to door salesman once. I remember you telling this story 10 years ago on the DP threads. He was the last black person you spoke to in real life, huh? Tell me more about how and how that one time a door to door ""black friend"" taught you the super secret black American conspiracy of how 94% of black Americans are paid by welfare to vote for Democrats. Amazing how more black and brown Americans don't want a stern talking to and occasional patronizing pat on the head from Daddy Republican Jeff. The more you type, the more I realize why most black Americans never vote for the patronizing GOP."
"Ah, so this was a pathetic attempt at a ""rhetorical"" question.  Problem is it also constitutes the logical fallacy of false equivalency.  The flag to which you allude stood for suppressing the rights of black folks.  The ""advancement"" part of the title you're whining about represents rightful desire and striving to throw off the yoke of said suppression.

It also represents the reality that for most of our nation's history there were state-sanctioned social and legal BARRIERS to black folks advancing beyond their suppressed status which were backed by--likewise state-sanctioned--violence.  You can delude yourself these no longer exist because for you they have NEVER existed.  But for some Americans they still do--just not as upfront as when I was a kid.

As for what ""offends"" black folks, doubt you associate closely enough with any to have the slightest idea what they find ""offensive"".  That much is obvious from your posts."

"A use of force delivered with bias to race (and not purely behavior driven) is a big problem. Data presented in the article does nothing to scientifically support that this bias exists. We can be inspired to have hunches (and I am), but a real scientifically-driven exposure of injustice requires a measure of force actionable offenses as they relate to force actually delivered compared to race of force recipient, right?

To defend the data presented as proof of injustice is to assume that each race equally engages in force actionable offenses. Why should I assume this? I wouldn't be surprised if oppressed people (black Americans in this case) were proportionately more frustrated with their captors. Frustration begets violence among other outcomes, predictably...but why should a scientific perspective include a data-free prediction of each race behaving the same?"
So when this computer predicts a crime in a gang-infested black or hispanic neighborhood will it be declared racist?
"I'm not entirely sure what your point is, but let me clarify mine: Just because Communism Governments CLAIM to be acting in the interests of the working class and of equality doesn't mean that they actually are (and history shows us that they have emphatically not been).

"The first persons to posit the ""birther"" claims about Sen. Obama were Sec. Clinton and her presidential campaign staff in 2008.
Prior to the Great Society and the War on Poverty, Black Americans' economic status were on the rise. In 1965, Pres. Johnson proceeded to destroy the industry and pluck of Black Americans by telling them they could not take care of themselves, could not improve their own lot in life but had to be taken care of by the Gov't. This soft bigotry of low expectations has relegated generations of African Americans to second class status.
With the SJW's agitating for a $15/hour wage, Black Americans, and especially their youth, will be the first to feel the brunt of that disastrous policy.
It is the policies of Democrats and the Left that have most hurt African Americans.

We were fortunate for many years to have found a way to hide the evil (treatment of native Americans, Japanese, Blacks, etc.) from our own minds and emphasize the good.

"Yes, Kami, the civil rights movement was led by blacks who wanted equal rights for their kind. However, the resulting legislation, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was more expansive in granting rights.

Talk about victim mentality, free-loader, want something for nothing.  Native people account for less than 2% of the entire American population.  They aren't taking anything from anyone.  

I can't help but wonder if the ADN would publish comments insisting that African Americans' rights be terminated, and that Black people be relegated back to slavery.     Somehow I doubt they would. But comments that promote taking away Native rights are given a free pass.   They invariably dominate the comments on any article about Native people and offer nothing but vicious and untrue stereotypes."
"""The ACA is what used to be the Republican idea for health care. But since a black president implemented it, it needs to be destroyed"".
Two things! The majority of Republicans never supported Heritagecare, and if you have actually read the Heritagecare plan you would see it would have only mandated catastrophic coverage which would have had little to no effect on existing health insurance plans and wouldn't have forced individuals who had little need for insurance to purchase expensive plans. Obamacare never was and still isn't a Republican plan."
"Oh Barry, still plagiarizing USMCSniper I see. (https://disqus.com/by/USMCSniper/)Can't formulate your own ideas, you have to copy the words of some racist troll? Yeah I looked at some of USMCSniper's other posts. Pretty blatantly racist stuff you admire. Here's a tasty rascist nugget: 

""Blacks are better off under Obama. Where else in the world can a single Black woman gave six children from six different ""Baby Daddies"" and collect $60,000 in cash cards and housing benefits, free medical care for her family, pay no taxes, doesn't even have to look for work let alone work, and when her children are in school they get two or three free meals a day, and even in some states during summer vacation. And the ""Baby Daddies"" don't have to pay child support. Life is good in the hood.""

Why don't you plagiarize that Barry?"
"Seems vey divisive to me.  Should the focus not be on the futue and not the past.  What comes next? Non Blacks not allowed to participate as History shows they for the most part were the oppressors? In a World that Tomorrow sees Donald Trump as President, reconciliation seems a more important piece of the issue."
"Oh I really can't take an old CCFer like Caplan seriously when he is cheerleading for Hillary Clinton a former student of Saul Alinsky and a former law clerk to Comrade Robert Trueaft, once  a Chief Counsel of the Communist Party USA.   If she is elected she will be impeached in her first year in office and forced to resign.  President Kaine will pardon her and pardon Bill Clinton as well for the good of the country.   If she is not elected there will be a special prosecutor and she will be indicted along with Bill Clinton by a grand jury for multiple felonies.  President Trump will then pardon her and pardon Bill Clinton as well for the good of the country by having them plead guilty.   Barack Obama will leave office and assume his race hustling full time keeping the black community angry, resentful, and blaming whitey because black votes count more than black lives to Democrat politicians."
"Did you know that 2/3ds of Americans don't have a passport? And those that do are abroad only for vacations a few weeks a year.  European countries are so close together that they people there routinely cross into other countries. And their languages are not accepted common business language as English is.  Now, that being said, I think Americans, and British especially,  fall way short in not learning just 5 common words of the local language of the places they visit.  They think they can walk right up to local and speakie English right in their face.  You got to be careful in Spanish and French speaking areas, because the English are the historic rivals of the Spanish and French and hearing English makes those people feel humiliated.  Asians and Africans look up to the USA and to be able to speakie English makes them feel educated and proud.  To them English is the language of success, of greatness, of scientific genius."
"Lets dig a little deeper into our history . Who were the founding father's of the KKK--democrats . This whole issue lately is a joke , driven by the liberal press and democrats who hate Trump . And people like Begich who hate him as well  .Slavery ended long ago . No one alive today was impacted by it.  The KKK  has no impact on life in America.They can march to they're hearts content and only a few nuts would join them.  We have come so far as a nation we elected a black president twice .We treat the event Charlottville as though it was a major event , when it wasn't.  Only one person died . Even though Trump denounced the KKK by name , that still isn't good enough for the haters like Begich .Trump is 100 percent correct saying there was blame on both sides of the fist fight . He wasn't saying there are good KKK and and Nazi's . He was saying organized left haters were the one's doing the fighting . I don't recall marches in the streets when Obama didn't denounce left violence . Why ?"
"Bill: In 1969 I was teaching in an inner-city high school in Riverside, California.  The issue of affirmative action arose regarding ""advanced placement"" courses.  I presented the following idea which was adopted and worked.

1) We determined the percentage makeup of the student body (Black, Hispanic and non-Black/Hispanic.  We had almost a 1/3, 1/3 1/3 composition as it turned out.
2)  We determined the seats available in the classes....36 was the number used.
3)  The affected Departments chose their enrollment using those percentage figures.
4)  Minorities were ""equally"" represented based on their percentage of the school enrollment.
5) It worked out well, since there was no ""unfair"" affirmative action and no basis for claims of racial or ethnic discrimination.  

As, I think,you and I agree, we need to address racial/ethnic/sexist discrimination while, at the same time, working to be fair, rather than punitive, in so doing.  best regards, Gary"
"Yes, but he apologized, and recognized that the situation was ""unfortunate."" Doesn't that work for black people too?"
"Nope. If I had been there to ""protest the removal of a statue,"" even though that statue had been erected to intimidate and terrorize black people after they were freed from slavery, and had been marching alongside terrorists with tiki torches shouting ""Jew will not replace me!"" and ""blood and soil,"" faces contorted with rage and hatred, I would have left, unless I felt some kinship to them. You cannot march alongside terrorists and claim innocence. No. Quit trying to defend the indefensible."
"NAACP affiliates may be hesitant to publicly state their views. The conditional ""price tag"" of the local ""alliance"" or partnership between the NAACP and the JCRC is silence on this issue.  The last thing our organized Jewish community wants is for Blacks and local people of color to openly support Palestinian human rights and they have reason to be concerned. People of color across America are standing in solidarity with the Palestinians connecting Israeli racism/brutality to that in the U.S. These include UCLA history professor Robin D.G. Kelley and Bill Fletcher, Jr. - both on the U.S. Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel advisory board - Ajamu Baraka, Angela Davis, Aaron Dixon, Cornel West, Jo Ann Hardesty (Portland NAACP president), Patrisse Cullors (co-founder of BLM), and Margaret Kimberley. These are among the 1,100 black activists who have signed a statement supporting BDS and full Palestinian human rights including the refugee right of return. www.blackforpalestine.com"

"Yes we do disagree & if this were not a discussion about supporting, thru priorities, the furtherance of sexism or hatred & oppression of women in Christianity, I would be fine with just disagreeing.  But just as if you were supporting neo-nazism as somewhat Christian or supporting a change in Church rules that could only result in black people being completely segregated from the hierarchy in our church, uniquely, compared to all other races, then I could step aside.  However, this issue is too important to let disagreement appear equally just no matter what side the reader chooses.

If you know that a change will automatically create a situation of increased oppression to one group of people, but that wasn't the plan, you cannot claim innocence of the sin, of the increased oppression, because you knew it would happen and did not change your course, or suggestion of action to others.

Also, there were actually women claiming to be called to priesthood throughout our church's history."
"Trump “might know that, at 16.9 per 100,000, the rate of firearm-related deaths for African Americans in 2014 is tragically and unacceptably high, but not indicative of a war zone where all black people are subject to being gunned down when they step out on their front porches in the morning…. He might know that, although racial disparities persist in mass incarceration, according to 2014 Justice Department data, 94 percent of black males aged 30-39 were not in prison.”

"Not so fast.  It was Ken Burns of the acclaimed PBS ""The Civil War"" documentary fame who let at least two ""wowsers"" through to the final cut.  If I recall correctly, they specifically had to do with Abraham Lincoln's age at the time he was assassinated and the actual number of black men who volunteered and served in the Union Army.

If a smart fella like Ken Burns can slip, then why not a nonspecialist like President Trump?  Trump never claimed to  be an historian, much less a student, of American history did he?"
"How fortunate we are to have killer McCoy come to Hawaii to agitate.  And he brought his friend with him, and promises to bring more like him.  Is Al Sharpton far behind?     
Obama put Hawaii on the popolo map.  Get ready Hawaii.  2 killings by black men in 3 days - does this remind anyone of Chicago? 
And of course, race will always be a defense.  Black men don't commit crimes, they are just falsely accused of committing crimes.  So, Hawaii, look to St. Louis, Ferguson, Baltimore,  and Chicago for a glimpse of what is in store for us, unless we stand up for law and order."
"The hype and media induced hysteria over the very small number of deaths by officers puts everyone at risk. All this for eyeballs and ratings.  As a sidbar total up all the black on black murders in Chicago since 2012.  An impressive bodycount, and nobody cares. Simply can't sell that, now can they."
"I would be very offended by if it were called 'The Imperial East India Company'.

I know it's not the owner's fault that happened, the same way I wish I did not benefit from the genocide of Native Americans. Yes I still live on this land. BUT I am not disrespecting it by wearing a headdress!! There is a difference between doing something with respect for culture, and then appropriating something without thought to how it may affect others. 

This is what their business has done. 

If you want to open a business you should. But respect the context of the place you are moving in to. Have a dialogue with your neighbors. Don't  get defensive and basically make the argument 'I'm not racist, I have black friends.' 

 Sure, the owner may not be racist but the name chosen for this restaurant is racially and culturally inappropriate."

"The southern democrats ruled the Old South before the Civil War, and it was the democrats who intimated black republicans, after the war. Is that also part of the southern history that should be forgotten as well?  It sounds like your ""culture of institutionalized racism"" came from your own party.  

 From Wikipedia on the Old South:

The ""Old South"" also refers to the tradition of Southerners voting the Democratic ticket. During the Reconstruction period after the Civil War, black people exercising their right to vote for the first time led to a Republican South until 1877, when southern Democrats returned to power due to intimidation of black voters and laws that suppressed civil rights. 

As more middle class and educated Republicans move to the south from other areas of the country and white support for segregation and racist policies subsided, the south began to shift to the Republican party starting with Nixon winning a few southern states in 1968."
"What relevance does all that have to the embezzlement issue under discussion?—Ed McManus  When we studied justice and rights in school, my classmates and I decided that in this life there was to be neither justice nor rights.  The idea is to behold the face of God in justice . . . or the apparent lack thereof.  Should a pastor fleece his flock, he would not be the first.  Just as Black Catholics surviving those sold down the river by the Maryland Jesuits, rather than set them free, just as those surviving Black Catholics kept their Roman Catholic Faith, so must the rest of the Faithful occasionally, when also fleeced by their pastors.  Jacob should not have had to fight with his loving God.  That demoniac should not have been possessed by an evil spirit, to begin with.  All of such goofy stuff can draw the Faithful to contemplate God at Mass . . . at least maybe.  😊"
"... after the Oscars made overdue history by awarding best actor to Denzel Washington and best actress to Halle Berry, the first time black actors won both top performing honours in the same year. It’s a feat that hasn’t been repeated since.

========================

Blacks make up 13% of the population of the U.S. When you consider that a good proportion of the actors nominated come from the UK, France, Canada, and other countries with a smaller black population than the U.S., a 1 in 10 ratio is probably closer to representative of the overall actor pool. That means in any given year, if blacks were represented in leading screen roles proportional to their share of the overall population nominations are drawn from, we should expect 1. of the 10 best actor nominations  to go to a black actor - or one every two years for each of the lead acting categories. So statistically, both a black actor and actress winning the Oscar  in the same year should be extraordinarily rare."

"Not a big fan of John Lewis, but Trump needs to pass specific legislation and policies to help African American businesses and business owners and to make capital more available to them.  He also needs to give equal treatment to the black indians and the freedman indian treaty of 1866 and start treating African Americans and black indians as equals to red indians under the law.  It is obvious the democrats have done nothing and will do nothing to help African Americans, so maybe Trump can be different and pass the legislation that democrats never will."

The black scholar must fully embrace this tradition of American intellectual life; 'the proper choice for the American Negro scholar is to use his/her history and ingenuity, his/her resources and talents, to combat the forces that isolate him/her and his/her people and, like the true patriot that s/he is, to contribute to the solution of the problems that all Americans face in common.”

Many of the old Republicans like Hatfield were good on issues of race. The current bunch, not so much. I won't switch party affiliation this year. Defeating Trump is the most important thing to do this election. With Trump, we could be one tweet away from WWIII. Finally, we have to make sure the police protect and serve all of us.

"Thanks for your kind words. I've appreciated our conversation, on this otherwise quiet thread. 

I don't disagree about there being a violent subculture, doing great harm within many Black neighborhoods.  Cliques of undirected and disenchanted young men and boys are one of the long-standing challenges of modern societies. Where a society understands those youths to be its own children and future, it tends to take seriously the job of engaging them productively. Where societies do not regard them as their own children, it's of little consequence what happens to them. 

Good luck with Anderson's book. She has a contentious thesis, but I think she does good work assembling an historically based overview. At the very least, it may give you a more detailed sense of the sorts of things people have in mind, when they argue the merits of taking an historical view of current conditions in Black communities, as I have tried to do here.

All the best"

"""Freedom of religion"" is an American right in the Bill of Rights.

It has nothing at all to do with events outside the United States, which are not regulated by the Bill of Rights.

What does bear on freedom of religion in the platform is:

""We support a progressive vision of religious freedom that respects pluralism and rejects the misuse of religion to discriminate.""

A group of prominent black clergymen brought this to the losing candidate's attention and pointed out the exiting Administration had used this policy to attempt to compel people of faith to perform acts abhorrent to their religion, both Catholic and Protestant. They received no response.

"The hostility toward men is shown in schools that sponsor workshops on ""male privilege"" and ""toxic masculinity."" And also how they treat men accused of sexual assault. You yourself stated all men are rapists and bullies. Your views are simply negative stereotypes that would be unacceptable if applied to any other group, such as blacks or Hispanics. And, no, it's not just about someone's ""perception""--it's about an attitude that has become pervasive, especially on college campuses. Men are right to challenge those attitudes--but when they do, they're told to ""get tough"" or to ""check their privilege.""

The committee suggested that marijuana be legalized, but Nixon did not like hippies, black people or mexicans so the committee decision was thrown out."

Ever pause to wonder why the crowd at Ferguson was so ready to believe an unarmed black man had his hands up before being shot to death by a police officer? Maybe because there was a history of police abuse in Ferguson. As elsewhere. As in the case of Walter Scott, for instance. Of course Scott didn't have his hands up. He just got shot in the back.

<<The actions of these men, and others like them, keep people of color from getting themselves out of impoverished circumstances.>>

A 10% reduction in black on black crime would save far more lives than a 10% reduction in lost lives due to police misconduct.

The real ""shock"" that should be examined is ""black surprise that blacks/Hispanics crossed the tired Democratic line"".

"DC,  What evidence do you have for cause and effect for your claim that these laws prevented any blacks from moving to Oregon?  It was expensive and dangerous to travel from the  east to Oregon either overland or by sea.  Prior to the end of the Civil War how could a slave get to Oregon and why would free blacks in the north wish to come to Oregon?  Instead of accusations and insinuations of others you should apply some academic rigor to your own theories.  For example, how exactly did virtually illiterate, dirt poor, and oppressed blacks in the south hear or read about George Bush being expelled?  Was this case plastered all over eastern newspapers?  That would at least begin to support a theory that eastern free blacks didn't go to Oregon because of the expulsion."

It is in the interest of politicians that a certain narrative is told and believed. Schools should create a safe and neural environment to teach your history, my history and then stimulate a debate for the two to meet somewhere. There is a big debate about ""indigenous land"" - if your open to honest debate, do some research on what year Van Riebeeck arrived and when the they came across the first black person (Xhosa). Read about tribal areas and tribal wars. I can go on about more, but space is limited and not everyone is open for constructive debate."
"I disagree with you, LFS. Voter fraud was found to be virtually nonexistent under AG Ashcroft after a rigorous six-year investigation. They found fewer than a hundred cases of fraudulent vote. Voter disenfranchisement on the other hand has the potential to take the vote away from 15 million mostly poor citizens. One example that me>you left out is that the long voting lines in places like Ohio, where deliberate underserving in poor/black areas caused waits of six hours, made it impossible for the elderly to vote. The state police in Florida stopped black drivers on election day, and voter lists were purged of James Johnson's if even one was a former felon. This is the REAL voter fraud."

"Thank you for sharing this story. I join you in applauding those students, and celebrating their achievement. I tend to take this event as a coda to the earlier devastation of the Black Power movement, and particularly the assassination of Fred Hampton. Personally, I thought that the Panthers' political analysis and program was more coherent, compelling, and pertinent to the general population, which was why they were targeted so viciously. The attack on Move, I think, served to show that even a marginal and not especially charismatic organization was more than could be tolerated, and could be crushed with impunity. 

At present, there is more and more information about our racist history entering the public sphere. This gives me hope that the privileged comfort of ignorance and denial will become much harder to preserve. The Black Lives Matter movement also gives me hope. It's a difficult time, but with much opportunity. God Bless."
"Paul Scott ...You should give ..reading your own article before you post it to make sure it agrees with what you said"" a try next time. 

Your 'factcheck"" site said : ""It’s not mathematically impossible. The 59 districts are in areas of the city that are mainly African American, as the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. And Obama received 93 percent of the black vote nationwide"" 

In addition to the 59 precincts in Philly there were another 37 in Chicago...  

assuming that each precinct had exactly 400 voters and there was a 96% chance that each voter would vote for obama then the likelihood that 59 precincts would all vote 100% for obama while mathematically possible the odds are worse than winning the Powerball Lottery at (without crunching the numbers but with a pretty good head for numbers) something like 15 in 120 million...if you add in the additional 37 precincts in Chicago ...some of which were under 30% black ...the odds become statistically 0...but thanks 4 playing"

"Read the article and found myself questioning the constant reference to African Americans instead of the South Asian American communities in the derogative ""Ghettos"".  Putting down one ethnic group to elevate another is not what the article was to be about or was it? That the Blacks such as those living in another country, under different social oppressions and living in a state of poverty  deserving to be associate to the term you first stated carries a negative connotation? It is my understanding that there is a large population of South Asian peoples living in ""Ghettos or Slums"" in India than those American Blacks that your refer. It is not necessary to defer the use of this word upon any minority group in order to convey your point. It is a word that can be removed unless referred to the state representatives or government that neglects to proper service the needs of the forgotten community. Communities of willing and hardworking citizens. Brampton is not a Ghetto. It has issues."

"I am guessing that racial profiling is in our dna as a survival response thousands of years old.  As humans evolved in small family groups,  less than 100 people in most cases,  probably less that 50 most commonly,  it was incumbent upon them to recognize danger in order to survive.  Skin color,  head shapes,  body shapes,  eyes,  hair,  noses,  all would be signs of humans who would present a danger to the group.  Hard to lose DNA based survival mechanisms.  

Law enforcement responds to similar calls,  for common reasons,  to a small variety of incidents and people.

I don't like the way the media has tried to bury Bernie and Trump and Trump is still standing so I'm going for him.  Case and point, media makes him out to be anti-women, anti-black. I judge people by what they do not what they've said. What he's done is hire and promote women and blacks within his organization.  This testimony from a black woman that works for him is case and point. Trump hasn't publicized this because they didn't want her endorsement out of respect for her father (Trumps friend, famous black doctor) and the fact she had a coke habit Trump wanted to keep on the down low ...he's ""gangsta"" like that, takes care of his own, very loyal, and I respect that and the fact neither he or his kids drink or use drugs BUT they obviously don't judge or throw those that do under the bus.  http://tinyurl.com/j6tus2b"
"Is there distress that the nation is divided or just that this division is now so visible?  The debate has not made this any worse. ""Black lives matter"" is a statement that since the first black slaves arrived it is obvious that black lives do not matter, nor the lives of indigenous peoples, nor the lives of the thousands who are killed directly by the American war machine and the hundreds of thousands killed yearly in the perpetual conflict zones which are fed by the military industrial complex. Sounds all conspiracy oriented until one takes the time to ""fact check"". America has become a police state, with ominous state surveillance of everyone, where one can now be jailed for expressing one's opinion. It has become a theocracy, with a military indoctrinated by fascist evangelical ideologues, and a civil base ready to let loose on the new ""minority"" to target for persecution and exclusion - American Muslims. Like it or not, Trump is America, and Hillary is hardly a substitute."
"Through the lens of today many historical figures would be regarded differently, in many cases unfairlt. For instance, what should we make of the iconic Mohawk chief Thayendanegea (Joseph Brant)? He apparently owned 20 or more negro slaves, as was the custom at the time for landowners like him. Should we now rename the City of Brantford?"
Just the fact that Trump has black friends would seem to me to be a major clue that he is not racist.
While agreeing with your views of past mistreatment it does not mean we should make future generations separate and distinct as citizens.  They are not.  Canada had slavery until the early mid-1800's (and of course the Indians had it for centuries before that) and we all know America had it....why not restitution for black people?  What about the Vietnamese and Japanese and the Jewish citizens that were mistreated?  Do we give women 2x the vote for not getting the right til well after men.      The fact is when you separate and treat people different they are less likely to succeed and that is what is taking place with our beautiful FN peoples.
"I don't want to believe that this is a stupid 'political correctness' issue between two friends.

With nothing from the U of O, that appears to be the best guess around, though.

And that's in the all-volunteer-ever-so-trained-to-be-respectful Army of  Iraq/Afghanistan mandated by civilian authority over the last 30 years or so, not the US military who fought in Viet Nam!

I was in both groups; at the platoon/squad/fire team  level in particular, there are seriously rude comments exchanged. 

Think tribalism.  Arabs have it fairly well-defined:  ""I and my brother against my cousin, I and my cousin against the stranger.""

'Brothers' exist at the squad level, especially in combat units.

"And Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize before he entered office. Depending on whom you ask and what time of day you ask it, Obama did more to kill terrorists than Bush. Obama was adored by Hollywood and mainstream media.

Obama was this country's first President with African American roots. It was and is a major historical event. Like him or not, it doesn't change that fact. Is it really surprising that more people wanted to be part of that kind of history? We will never have another first black president.

Keep trying to use that to promote your agenda of being anti-Trump.  I did not support or want him as president. I prefered another Republican.  Many Republicans wanted another candidate.  If Trump gets re-reelected in 4 years it will be because he was successful. I for one hope he gets reelected because that means the country is better off than it is now."

"I disagree that the coach's message was ""we are all the same"". The coaches message was ""There's us and them -- why are you afraid of them? Here's some of them. Touch some of them. See, don't be afraid of them."" It's a sick, clueless, offensive mentality. 

Also, you cannot tell us WHY the other parent declined to be interviewed. Sure, in wealthy communities there are lots of parents trying to manipulate the coaches. But also a black family will often try to keep their name out of the news on a complaint because their child still has to attend school and be in the social milieu where other kids may ostracize them for getting the coach in trouble.  

I hope the school district does the right thing and gets rid of this coach. And uses it as an example for other coaches of how not to invoke race with our young people."
"Are you really that thick?  You certainly aren't that humorous.  You really believe that the only reason that Republicans wanted to see Obama's birth Certificate was because he's black.?

"Bridich deserves credit, but not necessarily more than Bud Black (despite Black's stubborn reluctance to shake up the batting order at times). Black got the Rockies to play to their potential for 3+ months and he was a great influence on the young pitchers. However, I would argue the Rockies are still closer to a .500 team than one that can challenge the D-Backs and Dodgers consistently. The Giants' complete trainwreck of a season cannot be understated when evaluating how it changed the NL West this season.  But I am thrilled we get at least one playoff game. As a guy who really thought 82 wins was the ceiling this year, how could I complain about that? And Bridich's moves--at least this year--worked more often than they didn't. It'll be interesting to see if a healthy Desmond has a Parra-like resurgence in 2018."

"According to the followers of the Teleprompter Jesus™, two term Obama was persecuted just for being black while president, so it comes as no surprise that the biggest news of the day for the anti-Trumpers isn’t the $110 billion arms deal with the Saudis, but a glowing orb from a Harry Potter movie. Secretly, they’re just angry that Obama wasn’t invited to touch the Magic Muslim 8 ball, after he kissed their behinds."
"Amazing how these, so called, reporters are able to look past Clinton's actions, including Hilary's attacks on them, versus and Trump's words.

I'm sure Juanita Broderick's interviews about Bill Clinton's attack on her can be found online. You might have to go to the evil and biased FOX or Drudge to find it rather than the noble and balanced Washington Post  but it's available.

It's only an itty-bitty teeny-weeny little fringe of embittered job-hunters like yourself who blame Sanders for Clinton's failure. But, then, if you could read polls, you wouldn't have voted for a nominee with a 56% disapproval rating in the first place.

"I agree that people vote in terms of the benefit of greater society, or at least in terms of what benefits them individually, but people still have their own, individual political agency. So, in the DA and in the ANC, for example, members should be allowed to disagree and vote against motions with which they do not agree. Also, I don't agree with referring to, say, black people as ""masses"", as I see people as individuals with their own unique situations. One cannot generalise about black people, just as one cannot speak for all black people. Thus, people should be treated as individuals. I hope you agree with me."
The Voting Right Act was a half century ago. We are stuck in a time loop? There are no other issues at play? Just that scenario over and over? I guess being a black American is a very PRIVILEGED ethnicity to be. I suppose society has an issue with black privilege because even in 2017 constructive criticism can't be made against this demographic; it all gets trumped by the voting rights act of 1965 and MLK's dream.
"Increased gun sales are motivated by fear of confiscation. Mine! Mine!Mine! cries the bitter clingers when threatened.

"""The Turkish Ottomans were Sunni""

Yes, I confused them with the Safavids.  That being said, the main point about their persecution of what they deemed heretical sects still stands.  How did they treat the Ismailis? Alawites? Druze?  Selim's war against the Safavids was largely on sectarian grounds, and he openly persecuted the Shia Alevis.

""The Berbers may have terrorized the North Africans, but were not the primary Muslim Empire"" 

What's 'primary'?  They rebelled consistently against the Rashidun and early Fatamids, converted, and then it's a slow rise to power during the Umayyad caliphate until they founded the fundamentalist Alomohad and Almoravid dynasties that cemented all of northern Africa, from Marrakesh to Cairo, and including southern Spain. They took 1/2 of the entire Umayyad territory from them. The point is, obviously, that there were millions of Muslims, of differing sects and tribal origins, and only SOME of them were tolerant."

"Notice both of the above responses to Jacks post.  

Neither indicate a particular strong concern for public safety and human preservation, both indicate a strong ideological position against the notion of firearms.

Both of these posters were also conspicuously absent from the New York truck attack story which only supports the notion that anti-gun folks are just that, anti-gun.  

They are not pro-public safety, as the issue for them is not safety.  If it were they would be just as active in posting in articles on ALL mass killings, not just select ones where the weapon of choice was a firearm.

We can point to a myriad of things that kill more people then firearms do, and you'll notice those get brushed off as a deflection or just not that important.

Logic will very infrequently penetrate the cloak of ideology.  Gun control for these folks is NOT about keeping firearms out of the hands of criminals, it's about systematically removing them from society."
"Don't look now, Conrad, but we've had a two-party system for over two hundred years.  The party you'd like to have doesn't exist and likely never will; at least not in our lifetime.

Besides, if Hillary is elected our new president we won't be getting one president; we'll have  two.  Can we say the same about Sanders?"

That is like blaming Obama or Hilary for the behavior of the Black Lives Matter activists who riot, loot, shut down highways, etc,  when they hold their protests.

"I think the good/sorta/bad feature poses an ethical problem, because it is anonymous and collective.

Christianity (and Roman Catholicism) teaches that we should not blacklist our brothers and sisters who do ""bad"" things. The Bible says : ""if thy brother shall offend against thee, go, and rebuke him between thee and him alone"" (Matthew, 18:15). 

So the Bible teaches us not to remain anonymous when we judge that our brother or sister did something bad.

Christianity teaches forgiveness and mercy. How can the people ""unbad"" a post previously judged as ""bad"", which they want to forgive ?

The good/sorta/bad feature trivializes the notion of judging people as ""bad"", whereas Pope Francis, for example is famous for saying ""who am I to judge"" ?"

(2)You say the West shouldn't wag fingers, but you call on Canada do that &more- envisioning a saviour that will ride in and save the good folk from big bad African presidents. How do you,or Canada,know what Kenyans want? A few chats with uber drivers & bartenders doesn't make u an expert. Kenya does not need a foreign saviour!

I bet money the Deputy was polite and courteous...No evidence the Deputy even knows the driver is an African American prior to the stop!  This is the same thing Linda Hamilton's husband does all day long as a State Trooper.  It's a simple routine traffic stop.  The only difference is it involves someone willing to attempt scamming public resources and tarnishing law enforcement's image for her own benefit...It's absolutely pathetic.

Does one take acting lessons for it from Sidney Poitier?  Ah well, congratulations for one of the most inane posts in this thread so far.  And that's saying quite a bit."
"Great!

Now, do you want to address the substance of my post or continue, in typical liberal fashion, to cling to a small or irrelevant claim in my post that does not affect the substance of the argument?  

If liberals are the bastions of free speech, why are they always trying to shut down conservative speech on colleges?"
"You are confused.  The KKK was the military wing of the Democrat Party as Black Lies Matter and Antifa are today.  The Segregationists were all Democrat.  FDR was a great admirer of Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini and he laid the foundation for todays strong central government and control of the American economy."
"""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime.""  A long-standing axiom, still standing.  This wasn't tagging some wall or shoplifting.  Stabbing?  And you go snowflake?  Nah... logic prevails here.  Some hard time is the lesson, whether they learn it or not is their choice."
"And that's because classy President Barack Obama was black, a constitutional lawyer, proud father, proud husband, and proud of the American people that he tried to help escape the Republicant cliff."
"I have noticed many well marked crude pipelines near large shopping malls & schools in western Canada.

The real danger lies in pipelines carrying more volatile commodities than crude. Years ago I clipped a tube carrying natural gas into my house. I was using a Black & Decker lawn edger-trimmer. Back then they had metal blades not a nylon string.

The tube connected the small feeder utility pipeline to the gas regulator installed for my residence. The pipe in the ground was connected by a thin metal tube to the solid pipe by the gas meter. I thought that my house would blow up or catch fire. Fortunately there was no spark to cause ignition.  A new TUBE was installed by the gas company."
"You claim to care about those unaccompanied minors -- but you supported a man who boasted he would kick out the ones that were here and build a wall to keep them out, when he was president. 

You claim to care about that child with Down's syndrome -- but you supported a party that has made clear their intent to cut the social safety net for the disabled and the elderly, when he was president.

You claim to reach out to all, in service for the ""common good"" -- but you supported a man whose campaign was based on the demonization and belittlement of blacks, Hispanics, Muslims, immigrants of all backgrounds, the disabled, veterans, women, gays.

In all sincerity, your words are blind, self-serving, and meaningless, and you hope we will forget what you did and said then. 

We will not forget."
"Slaves counted as 2/3 of a person to calculate states' populations and their respective proportions in the Electoral College. Now black may vote, but they have to show yacht club memberships in the Republican South.

Ironically, the Elector College was also instituted to preclude the election of dreadfully incompetent candidates. Fail."
"Trump said ""wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners..."" That is not demanding they all get fired. 

The NFL is 70% black, and they are some of the highest-paid professionals on the entire planet. Maybe they go to another country, one of those much fairer places, to play? Oh wait nobody else cares about football. 

I'm saying maybe come up with some actual demands / things you're protesting specifically. Rosa Parks was protesting the fact that public transport was segregated. These players are not oppressed in the slightest. I would be happy to stand behind them if they had something specific they wanted to change, instead of hijacking the national anthem to protest some general feeling of inequality."
"The right to be left alone is not absolute, which is why viable fetuses are protected as part of the public interest. Non-viable fetuses are not because there is no authoritative statement in national law giving them that interest. Pass it or don't pass it, but don't act as if that is not the next logical step. The findings of Roe don't change until you do. There is a police power that exists when there is no General Will, as Rouseau would have called it. Libertarians also have General Will critera on some issues, although opion is mixed on abortion. The police power of the states is restricted under the 14th Amendment because they constantly misuse it agaisnt Latinos, Gays, Blacks and Women, as well as Catholics. The tenth amendment is largely oveturned by the fourteenth, the state must prove an overriding interest to target legilsationat a class. I suspect adult consensual incest laws are void Adultery laws have mostly been overturned. Bigamy laws won't last a challenge."
"I find it shameful that a political organization like the AFN would so blatantly seek to exploit the pathos associated with a dying man. Perhaps our very pretty prime Minister could invite Gordon Downie to the Liberal's next fundraising dinner? That would certainly contribute to making cash-for-access acceptable, would it not?

Political exploitation of a dying celebrity is nothing new. Remember the parade of African National Congress members trying to cash in as Nelson Mandela lay dying?"
"1. In this absurd country, juries award $300M for a broken tooth and then the judges reduce it to 30,000 so let's not get excited with this ridiculous ruling.
2. This being the US of A where $$$ is supreme, it's legitimate to ask how much Boeing gave the political parties and the Commerce department over the years."
"Wolfrun, Black doesn't give squat about any pesky facts, he's just here to cast aspersion, nothing else."
"I agree with Trump that John Lewis should pay more attention to his congressional district and tens of millions of African-Americans he purports to speak for,

  Lewis risked his life for civil rights 50 years ago, becoming an icon. But like other liberals, what has he done for anybody these last 50 years?
   Supporting corrupt unpopular oligarch, Hillary Clinton, for president was a big mistake. He and other elitist Democrats have only themselves to blame for Hillary losing the election. Elitist African-American organizations like the NAACP and the Black Caucus, along with tens of millions of other African-Americans, should have supported the highly popular, uncorrupted, progressive Bernie Samders.
   Tens of millions of blacks need a genuine progressive who believes in economic transformation, free university, free health care, and equality for all oppressed minorities, not the status quo Hillary or Obama.
   Furthermore, all the polls showed Sanders beating Trump by a wide margin."
"You really don't know that in the Early Christian Church---people elected their pastors, bishops even the pope.  Let me cite some references for you.

St. Cypran, a third century African bishop and martyr, recognized the election of Cornelius as Bishop of Rome because he had been ""made bishop by the judgment of God and of His Christ, by the testimony of almost all of the clergy, by the vote of the people who were then present, by the college of venerable bishops and good men....""

"The headline uses the phrase ""Valley of the Bros"".

Wow.

Is the writer somehow unaware that it is searingly offensive to use the word ""Bros"" when writing against men?

Look, men when talking among one another are free to use the word ""bros"" if that is how they want to refer to one another, just as black folks in America, when they talk to one another, are free to use the ""N"" word if that is how they want to refer to one another (and they frequently do, it is a commonly embraced term).

But look, writer, get out of my face when you try to use those words pejoratively, as an outsider who is not a member of that group. It is offensive and bigoted and does not help with the argument you try to make.

In case you are somehow unaware, there was a reason black folks in America bristled in outrage when Justin Bieber used the ""N"" word in one of his sentences.

Get out of my face with your put-down slur."
"So you're saying the officers in Seward do their job. That's good. As far as these particular people being blown away by the scenery? Not likely. It was 1:40 am according to the report. That means it was just pitch black outside here in AK. No, I think they were just speeding. Come to think of it, going fast is something people on meth do really well."
"Exactly.  There should be the same reaction to smearing Harry for his forebears than there is for smearing honest, hard-working blacks for the higher crime in their neighbourhoods they also have nothing to do with. Anyone trying to forward guilt based on some group characteristics, whether that characteristic is sex, race, class, sexuality, generation, family, etc. is all plain, garden variety bigotry."
"I wish I could agree with you on the common perception that ""most people are good."" While that is a feel-good perception that makes us feel safe in the world, I also think it limits our understanding. What I do believe is that most people are not bad an overwhelming majority of the time, that some people are quite bad (sociopathic) all the time, and others are consistently decent, ethical, and giving all the time. I also believe we exist on a moral bell curve with a lot of area for shades of gray. I do believe that Trump's success can be credited to his racist, bigoted, misogynistic campaign as much as the voters wanting deep reform in connection with this gilded age and non-stop wars.  All racism isn't ""hard,"" meaning out in the open, Jim Crow style. Much of it is soft, as you state, systemic and institutionalized.  Much of it is values based. People of color are not seen as inferior due to color, but their behaviors, which may be culturally based, are seen as inferior.   continued ."
"Maybe G&M could expand it lens (how about first openly trans people to win publicly elected positions) and also report that Andrea Jenkins, also an openly trans woman (of color) also won a seat on the Minneapolis City Council - also historic along with Roem?"
"Castro never supported Apartheid. He equally didn't support the slavery er... (forced labor) that Portugal made Africans do in Mozambique and Angola; slavery that the Catholic Church never condemned!

BLM wouldn't seem as necessary if the murders of Michael  Brown to Philandro Castile hadn't occurred.

For those against BLM, were YOU this condemning of the IRA and its offshoots?"
"I know untouchability is illegal in India. The last time it was legal was when the British were ruling India. At that time, there was Apartheid against all Indians (European only hotels, restaurants, neighbourhoods, streets, etc).

The author of India's constitution was a Dalit - Ambedkar. Unlike the USA, where not a single black person was involved in writing the US Constitution.

50 percent of all engineering seats in India are reserved for the Dalits and other disadvantaged communities. In Canada, 0 to 5 percent of engineering seats are reserved for disadvantaged communities like the First nations.

Finally, there has been a Dalit Indian President, Dalit Cabinet ministers, etc. The on-ff provincial premier of India's biggest state for the last 20 years has been a Dalit woman. In Canada, no minority woman has ever been a provincial premier.

Did you know the above facts? Probably not."
"With State funding and assisted funding for aspiring black businesses through the NEF, IDC, Small Business Development and countless others, and with BEE legislation, black formal business still only constitutes 15% of total formal business. An education system that ranks virtually last out of 144 countries certainly does not help."
"I was in Chicago this past summer and quickly realized how much the US economy depends on ""illegal"" immigrants. From gardeners, construction labourers and maids to kitchen help there are a whole bunch of jobs Americans simply won't do.

"You don't think there is some grouping of race in this discussion?  If not, then why is there a Black Lives Matter movement?  That group is based on race, so your comment about me being blind based on my racial prejudices is actually you being blind to the reality that there most certainly is racial groupings within our culture.  Here, watch this all the way through, and in it the lady, who is obviously way in the wrong, starts accusing the cop of racism, when it has nothing to do with why she's having a problem with the cop:

https://youtu.be/SCLTpcl44es

I'd love to have the utopia where everyone is color-blind.  But, at least for now, that doesn't exist and racial grouping is often revisited again and again.  That's the reality."
"To what extent do we live in a free country?  To what extent should we control the actions of individuals when those actions have no direct or significant affect on others except in their minds.  Those who would restrict smoking resort to the notion that second-hand smoke comprises a direct and significant threat to their bodies.  In many cases, this is nonsense, but the drive to control is legitimized by a direct and significant physical effect.  In the case of a person applying black make-up, the only adverse effect is admitted to stem from the minds of others.  Kinda like the Spanish Inquisition where people were burned at the stake for wrong thinking.  Racism only has meaning when it translates into action.  When folks throw around racism accusations without without actions of direct and significant consequence (based on intrinsic effect not interpreted effect), they only project their worldview.  It is important to distinguish the real from the presumed."

"Don't.  I have a thick black woolen ski mask that covers my face down to my shoulders.  And I have a warm, black top coat.  

Living in the 2nd warmest part of Canada, the GTA, we had 3 cold days last winter.  On one of them I wore my black ski mask and my black top coat to walk to my drug store.   

On my way out of my condo, I joked with the Concierge that in the spirit of Trudeau's anything goes attitude I was going to change from being a Christian man to being a Muslim women.  He thought that was pretty funny (but then he gets my sense of humour).

When I approached the pharmacist at the drug store, she gave me a look of absolute panic and I thought she was going to faint.   

It turns out the drug counter at the pharmacy had been robbed by a burka covered person just weeks before and she was the one on duty.

I apologized profusely, spent $40 on flowers, and felt like a real POS.

Everyone knows that wearing a tent is demeaning and dehumanizing.

Why?

Because its 2017 not 817."

"They'd be smarter to focus their demonstration on ""Lets turn out the vote and elect Democrats to the House and Senate 2 years from now, and then turn out for the next presidential vote""
.
When you read that the demonstrations are about LGBT, Black lives matter, obscure splinter-offshoots of feminism, day care, anti-pipeline, native Americans, and every bandwagon-jumping group there is....it dilutes the protest.  A protest about every issue is a protest about no issue."
"Without condoning violence from either side maybe those black Hillary supporters felt that the spew coming from Trump and his supporters was enough of a threat that a little preemptive strike was in order.  And don't come back with ""free speech"" as a defense or some false equivalency.  People start with a whole lot of vocal bravado in order to work themselves up to the real violence."

"I reject her analysis that we are witnessing “narcissistic populism.”

No, what we are witnessing is populism, period. Yes, its present American leader happens to be a narcissist, but that does not render the movement ""narcissistic populism.”

I mean, what is that phrase even trying to mean? Is it trying to pretend that narcissism (vanity, craving admiration, egotistical self-love) is somehow more a feature of populism than it is of, say, traditional conservatism or of leftist activism or of liberalism or of Marxism?  

I do not see populism to be particularly narcissistic. Indeed, narcissistic"" would seem a far better fit for activist movements such as Black Lives Matter, Toronto Chapter, which is pretty far away on the spectrum from the bunch in question (US populists)."
"Putin and the Russians don't need a map. They know what they want and how to achieve it. The key to Crimea is that it is where the main body of the Black Sea Fleet is stationed. For decades, foreign powers have tried to eliminate the Black Sea Fleet. Crimea is where the British and French fought the Russians in the Crimean war from 1853 to 1856.

For years, the Ukrainian government have threatened to cancel the lease at Sevastopol and have the Black Sea Fleet evicted unless they got more money. The threat is to offer it to the West as a NATO naval base.

When the Ukrainian government was overthrown in 2014, the new government made a mistake of announcing that Russian military forces would have to leave Crimea. The Russians have always had an elite force of around 20,000 soldiers including the Black Sea Fleet in Crimea. It was likely these soldiers who suddenly and quickly seized power in Crimea in a well planned exercise."
"I'm glad the altrightpubs went after the voter rolls and shortened times to register and vote. Send out fake junk mail in snail mailboxes telling everyone to vote the Tuesday after the actual day to vote. Other moves that clearly were focussed on the poor and minority. Especially black folks who were poor. We can't have those people voting EEK!
There's ample basis to make laws guaranteeing Americans voting rights and the voting processes. Simply put offending states on lifetime voter supervision by a nonpartisan committee and the funds for infrastructure and polling inspectors for enforcement. Crank up the penalty for such voter suppression tactics and election fixing.
History will remember how the Confederate states won in court to end restrictions designed to protect voters. Then moved quickly to crank the clock back to Jim Crow. Racism was over, according to the altrightpubs. The left said states will go back to Jim Crow. The left was correct. The left will repair the laws. Winning!"
"Again, this isn't about benefits or advantages its about justice.  One of my close friends at church took over 2 years to find a job as a CNA in an area which has shortages of people with those skills.  Why, simply because he is a black man.   He had the skills, he had the work history and there are plenty of openings he was applying to each week.   When he did get a job it was only part time at the worst hours anyone could ever want and then when their department had cutbacks he was the first to go.  What is just is a have a level playing field.  In the same token when the discussion of unity in the church is brought up then if the conferences can show they want to have equal opportunities and resources for all then there can be discussion then there can be discussion.  If not then no one is going to go and simply let themselves be exploited so the point is mute.  Sending love in Christ."
"Motley:  It seems these guys (and they're usually males) engage in a game of ""chicken"".  The will ignore traffic and pedestrian laws and dare drivers to not stop and collide with them.  If drivers in Eugene didn't make hundreds of accomodations for bike riders and pedestrians who are breaking the traffic, bike and pedestrian laws, there would be dozens of auto-bike and auto-pedestrian accidents each day.

I don't want to hurt anyone so I always lose that game of ""chicken"".  Nearly all drivers do likewise.  Upon ocassion, a driver simply won't see the biker or pedestrian and someone will get hurt.  BTW:  Why do so many bikers ride at night wearing all black and having no lights or reflectors?  Makes less than no sense to me.  It's really frightening to be starting through an intersect (with the green light) and suddenly a black attired spectre flashes across in front of you."
"Ham - you're clearly confused as to why the Black Lives Matter group formed and why a President of the US would speak in a fashion designed to calm rather than inflame a nation.

"IRT Larry01: It is difficult to say it has ""worked out well"", for those who have not seen the salary increase, and especially for minorities. Blacks have done very poorly the last eight years. Those who have seen their insurance premiums skyrocket haven't dome well. Those who now have thousands of dollars in deductibles haven't done well.  The military is in very bad shape; that's not worked out well. Also, those who have been executed around the world because of JV ISIS haven't dome well. Finally, the last 8 years Democrats have lost over 1000 elected positions in State and Fed. Government, from majorities in Congress  to now an overwhelmingly Republican House, a majority Senate, a huge majority of Governors, and now the Presidency.  The polls all said we were headed in the wrong direction. In my mind, it's hard to say ""And the last eight years worked out well"". I do appreciate that you are civil, something lacking in many of the posts."
"So there was legal segregation in Britain until when? Isn't that the relevant question? 12.5 million black Africans, mostly men, were sold by Africans to Europeans in the transatlantic slave trade and 11.5  million blacks, mostly women, were sold in the trans-Saharan slave trade to North Africa and the Middle East. And millions more enslaved in the Mediterranean or in the Ukraine and the Caucasus and sold in the Mediterranean. (Cambridge World History of Slavery, Volume 3). And untold million slaves exported from India to central Asia and the Middle East---a much under explored topic. What stands out in human history isn't the existence or persistence of slavery, despite  universalist, fairly egalitarian religions like Christianity, Islam, or Buddhism.  What stands out is that slavery and the slave trade were ever abolished and suppressed and for that Britain deserves special credit. There is no reason for believing the rest of the world would ever have done so on its own."
"Yeah, I read about George Soros some times, one of the biggest liberal Nazi on the planet (behaviorally, not in terms of politics). His family was a non-functional Jews and actually somewhat anti-Semitic in nature. Nothing really weird, if you really study the KKK or neo-Nazis group half of them got Jewish blood or black blood or Indian or whatever. But what he did....he was only 13 years old, I doubt if he even fully understood.....so even if I think he should taken to a wall and shot (metaphorically), I can give him a pass for what he did as a kid. You got no understanding on this, eh? Pretty cold blooded......or maybe I am getting just soft in my old age that I can't condemn a 13 years old who himself, was at the edge of abyss. Glad you can......"
"Good post. China is now well into a trillion dollar infrastructure program they call One Belt, One Road which would modernize the old Silk Road, put in a rail link from Belgrade to Budapest to serve Central Europe, a rail line to link eight Asian nations from China to India, and other links in Africa. US investment from major corporations is pouring in, trying to get a cut. China is determined to be THE major world economic player, and they think they can do it without military intervention, with money and diplomacy alone. Russia is on board with the Silk Road deal, since it would skirt their own territories which are now poorly served. The US is losing big time, aside from our private commercial investments.

"Dejain:  I think you've gotten to the core issue......We have over 300 million guns and they're way too easy to get.  Anyone...yes, anyone who has the money and wants one, can get a semiautomatic rifle with a large capacity magazine.  There are millions in private hands and readily available.  We've seen the results and, I fear, will continue to see more.  I would suggest we need to focus on the causes of the violence.  Social issues, economic issues, mental health issues, the huge failure of our criminal justice system, alcoholism and drug abuse, ...specifically on the increasing animosity between the Black community and police agencies.  If we don't effect some significant changes we're going to see increasing violence in a heinous cycle of destruction....each incident, each shooting, each incident of violence makes the next one that more likely........"

"Maybe walking across the street close to the local bar just after closing time while wearing black clothes wasn't the smartest thing in the world to do. Maybe when you saw that oncoming car weaving back and forth across the center line when you were driving, it would have been prudent to move over to the right as far as possible and reduce your speed. More generally, remember the old adage that applies to drivers and, especially, to pedestrians ""you can be dead right, or dead wrong; you're dead either way"". This is very similar in intent to the advice given women on how to avoid sexual assault; protect yourself first, and worry about who is in the wrong later."

Must you accept every contract irrespective of your desire to labor for the sole benefit of another party?
"Where'd you get that?  The Homicide rate (murder and non-negligent manslaugher) in 1950 was 4.5 per 100,000.  It peaked in 1980 at 10.2, and has been in a steady decline since, and gun ownership grew.  In 2014, it was back to 4.5.

Up to 80% of gun homicides in this country are gang related, either black on black (55%), or Hispanic on Hispanic, and occur in the inner cities.  The majority of the victims have a criminal history themselves.  It doesn't pay to not pay the man when the drug money is due. The late payment penalty is pretty serious.  Gotta send a message to the others, ya know.

My sympathy goes out to the police officers who deal with impassioned people that don't know how to follow orders.  I saw the video.  The man was reaching in the window.  Saw it with my own two eyes on the video.  If I were a police officer and my life was at risk and someone was refusing orders in spite of the fact I had a gun pointed at them that tells me only one thing.  Our society does not have a clue about respecting authority.  Now they play cat and mouse with police officers and when bad things happen they blame those who put their life in harms way to help prevent a chaotic society.  Imagine what it would look like on the street if all police officers were told to stand down when engaging any African American regardless if they obey orders or not.  Don't think it would go very well for the police officers.  Get a clue people.  Respect authority and don't play cat and mouse.
"Whether one agrees with President Obama's policies or not, it must be acknowledged that he is an inspiring speaker and quite likeable.

"The last five elections have been about oil, and very little else.  The issue is whether the oil companies can maintain the gridlock that has prevented anything being done about climate change.  Up to now, the combination of oil money and a cynical exploitation of the opposition of evangelical Christians to abortion, of gun nuts, and of increasingly strident racism, has allowed the oil companies to achieve their objective.

But their ability to play that game is facing a demographic tsunami.

They refused to reform themselves after the Romney defeat.

Instead, they doubled down on a strategy that requires them to whip an ever shrinking and narrowing demographic base into a frenzy.

And then the oil companies were beaten at their own game by an even bigger flim-flam artist.

A guy who has done everything he can to be as offensive as possible to Spanish-speakers, women, and African-Americans.

Four years ago the same people had a fairly well run campaign with the complete support of the GOP machine and the conservative talking heads and  they still couldn't upset the half black guy.

It is time for the GOP base to stop listening to like minded people and get a idea how many Americans really feel about Trump."
"Compare the South African prosecutional stasis to movement in Brazil as reported today by AFP in Daily Maverick: 

In Brazil: 
It is ""essential"" that the suspects be detained ""as a guarantee of public order"" to allow their assets to be blocked, and to stop them from engaging in any criminal act or interfering with evidence, the Rio prosecutor's office said in a statement.

In South Africa: 
""It is essential as a guarantee of public order that:
(1) the suspects not be detained;
(2) they be allowed to grow and expatriate their ill-gotten assets;
(3) they be allowed to engage in further criminal acts and interfere with evidence; 
(4) they be supported unconditionally and with no expense spared by all state institutions to achieve (1)-(3)"

"---The whole process described above is what NAMI considers “criminalization of the mentally ill”

There are two flaws in the above language: Mental illnesses are not criminalized. (Or 20% of Americans would be.)Though it has become a popular phrase, it is patently false. 

""The"" mentally ill ha also become a popular phrase, and is a false as ""the"" Blacks, once equally popular. It s wise to avoid employing it."
"Actually, in the Catholic Church at least, the first time that freedom of religion was admitted was at Vatican II. In 1954, the Holy Office ordered John Courtney Murray, SJ to stop writing on freedom of religion. 

LGBT rights are no different from rights for blacks, Jews and so on. If they are artificial, then so are other rights given to members of a discriminated against group."

In Africa, colonial paternalism has, in all too many cases, been replaced by autocracy – the African “big man” – which has not only been unrepresentative, but for the most part also intolerant, repressive and corrupt. It is the Asian commitment to popular welfare that has – even in the absence of democracy – offered political stability to its peoples."""

"One of your good Catholics just shot up a Masjid day before yesterday.  Another good Christian named Frazier Glen Cross shot three people to death in front of a Jewish Community Center in Kansas City, MO two years ago.  And still another fine upstanding Christian named Anders Breivik slaughtered 77 Norwegians in the name of Christian supremacy just six years ago.  And your good Christian ""Knights"" beheaded a black man in Texas ten years before that.  And I defy you to come up with ANY quantitative data that Muslims ANYWHERE have generated a body-count anywhere near that of the so-called ""Christian"" nations since WWII.

And kindly don't lump me with a group of murdering heretics that want to kill me and my family.  It makes no more sense than lumping black families with the sheet-wearers who want to lynch them.  A Shi'a scholar near my in-laws was murdered by the Da'esh for publicly denouncing their murder of Iraqi Christians.  Their victim was practicing ISLAM.  His murderers WEREN'T."

"Today's syrupy church music is probably responsible for driving more Catholics away from Mass than anything the bishops teach.

I remember the advent of the guitar Masses in the 1970s.  That folksy music was actually far better than the damp-palmed pablum like ""On Eagle's Wings.""

Since the 70s I've also noted that the music dept. seems intent on taking a major role in the Mass, filing up every spare space that used to be an occasion for group recitation with ""da da da da dah dah! hey everybody let us sing the words for you!""   Don't need it, don't want it.

I think everybody knows that Black churches get music right -- they make a genuine ""joyful noise.""  I can appreciate that popular parish efforts are trying their best to do likewise, but the result is irksome noise."

"I think that depends on how clever Trump is on spinning things. He'll find a reason to blame someone (Mexicans, Muslims, the media, Obama) for every broken campaign promise. His loyal supporters will continue to believe his lies while they lose their Medicare, have no health insurance and the only job they can find pays $8.00 an hour. But America will be great again."
"No, that's not how it works. Legalizing automatically threatens the black market. Black markets thrive when substances are illegal or too expensive to obtain. Colorado has near 40% tax and people are happy to pay rather than risk the black market. Washington has a 50% tax, more likely to find black markets thriving there. Do it right and the people who run the black market will come do their business legally."
"Sher this is a historically relative point. Slavery has existed in many cultures for thousands of years. Europeans brought over 12 million slaves to the americas --as a an aside it shouldn't be called the european colonisation, rather the african forced colonisation as only about 2-3 million european colonists arrived in the same time period--, this is an appalling number and represents an industrialisation of the heinous act. However, what percentage of the world's population was that? Vs.. say entire cultures such as India's caste system which perpetrated a segregated system since the Aryans destroyed the Harrapa/INdus valley cvilisation? How many people were there on the planet then? What percentage of slavery existed in the 2nd cent BCE vs. say the 1700s?

To suggest western racism has been more genocidal is a ridiculous rewrite of history. Ask the polynesian tribes conquered by the Maori or the various civilisations/states oblidterated and subumed by the Han chinese or Mongols!"

"The issue is governance.  Liberals want a free hand to reward party loyalists, and to mine opportunities for back-door political funding via traditional Liberal Party contractual king-making.  
One need only look at Infrastructure Ontario for a living example of black-hole dynamics operating at the epicentre of the huge capital spending flows overseen by government.  The Liberal government appoints party loyalists who in turn employ corrupt operators like Vas Georgiou to do the government's dirty work without directly staining government ministers when the labyrinth of corrupt dealings is eventually exposed.
The Infrastructure Bank proposed by Morneau is the civilized world's version of the 10% kickback men who direct financial dealings in corrupt third world countries.  It is the governance set-up that tells us this is so."

"If cannabis consumption during pregnancy harmed the child then we would be surrounded by hoards of ""The Cannabis Children"" because prohibition has not stopped one pregnant mom from smoking or eating cannabis if she wants to. All prohibition has accomplished is to connect pregnant women with the black market.

Because that was all a big Drug War lie, there were no crack babys because even crack cocaine didn't harm the foetus. The problem was poverty-stricken, malnorished mothers."
"Looking for solutions2--  While I found nothing  to confirm Joseph Lane was ever a slave holder, I did find some extraordinarily interesting material on Lane for which I am enthusiastically grateful to you.  As I have no time at the moment to digest all this, I'll be very brief:
First, that Oregonian opinion piece with the link here does claim Lane was a slave owner and cites  several sources to back him up, such as the Oregon Encyclopedia and Wikipedia.  However, I can find NO place where they  actually state Lane was a slave owner.  

However, there is a reference to the idea that some have claimed Peter Waldo, a young black man who lived with him on his ranch was a slave.  This linked to a fantastic source, truwe/tina, on Southern Oregon History.  This has an incredibly extensive list of historic  items on the complex relationship between Lane and Waldo, much of which was new to me.
Thanks again LFS2, you've given me much to ponder."
"Madison knew that the North would outnumber the South, despite there being more than half a million slaves in the South who were their economic vitality, but could not vote. His proposition for the Electoral College included the “three-fifths compromise,” where black people could be counted as three-fifths of a person, instead of a whole. This clause garnered the state 12 out of 91 electoral votes, more than a quarter of what a president needed to win.

“None of this is about slaves voting,” said Finkelman, who wrote a paper on the origins of the Electoral College for a symposium after Gore lost. “The debates are in part about political power and also the fundamental immorality of counting slaves for the purpose of giving political power to the master class.”

He said the Electoral College’s three-fifths clause enabled Thomas Jefferson, who owned more than a hundred slaves, to beat out in 1800 John Adams, who was opposed to slavery, since the South had a stronghold. PBS2"
"My condolences to Toronto.  I agree with the editorial view that the Toronto Pride Parade now marches backwards.

"True enough...he lacked command from the beginning and was hit hard before Hosmer.

"You know, people might actually take you seriously if your moniker was a bit more mature. 420? really?

""Ron Boyer believes the election of Hillary Clinton would be a positive signal because she’s a woman (letters, May 21).

There is literally no association between the two sentences. The first is in regard to the gender of the President and the historical precedent that would be altered (similar to the first half-black pres), while the other criticizes the push towards civil rights for all, regardless of sexual orientation. Why not complain about LBGTQ folks in lavs? It's an irrelevant issue."

"Actually - that's quite likely, lawyers are among the first jobs that could well be automated away. We may very well find that within the next few years giant lawfirms only have one or two actual lawyers - whose sole purpose is to handle the talking at trial, from notes prepared by an AI, who did all the research and found all the cases they will be citing for precedent. 
From there, it's not long before those guys are replaced too. We've already half-replaced judges with automation - there are AI algorithms that make recommendations to judges on sentencing -  and most follow those exactly (cutting their job in half). And, because AI is made by humans, we've found that those AI's are racist and consistently give tougher sentence recommendations for black people.  Automation can't cure human prejudice, in fact it tends to amplify it.

Another one likely to go: CEOs. Why would any board risk hiring Carly Fiorina when an AI can consistently run the company well ?"

"How is taking a statue down pretending the civil war never happened? Most of those statues weren't even put up at the time but decades after the c.w., at times of racial unrest; it was less about honoring than in telling blacks, you need to be kept in your place. Never understood this glorification of what they call the ""war between the states"" in the south; they lost. When I was in high school a German exchange student asked why there were confederate statues, since they lost the war. I had no idea. We asked my father, and he said people that supported that kind of stuff just weren't very smart. Makes me think of what some folks tell Clinton supporters: ""You lost. Get over it."" Clearly, many of them still haven't. Embarrassing."
"There's a bit of irony in those listed.  Arnold Schwartzenegger did exactly the same things as Trump, but he's come out against him. He was ""The Gropinator"" in the Doonesbury strip by Gary Trudeau.  John Negroponte was known as ""Ambassador See Nothing"" when he served in Honduras and ignored our allies' death squads. When he was Sarah's Attorney General, Ohio Dan Sullivan had a chance to do something about the horrific abuse of women in the Alaska National Guard, but chose to do nothing at all."
"I haven't seen anywhere that the President specifically called out Ms Heyer as antifa, BLM, or similar.  If her mother assumed Trump was talking about her daughter when he pointed out that there were violent counter protesters present, maybe there's a reason.  I have no idea one way or the other."
"It is evident from the reporting and commentary on this large demonstration that the mainstream media decided not to send reporters to the event. All of the subsequent reports/comments are based on watching a short video which covered a tiny fraction of the overall event.  One has to ask why there were no reporters assigned to the demonstration, particularly when very small protests from  groups such as Black Lives Matter and Idle No More receive extensive coverage, which dutifully and earnestly repeats those groups' messages.  Is the lack of actual coverage of the demonstration because the mainstream media did not want to report that a large number of  ordinary Canadians were protesting job-destroying carbon taxes?"
"The 2nd photo in this article shows a lady in a black dress standing to the right of McCarthy.

The order taker looked like I was crazy.  She then asked the kitchen staff.  The best they could answer is ""You can probably assume that the black bean burger probably doesn't have mushrooms.""  For a place that says it is vegan, you would think it would be able to list what the ingredients are."
"You misuse ""cherry-picked"" which means to select specific incidents not representative of the typical to give a biased, unrepresentative picture of the average or typical incident.  The black make-up example is from UO where the authors have association.  If they are serious about respect and tolerance, they must clean up their own home first.  This has nothing to do with Trump.  Tolerance and respect are universals.  The problem is that these dudes make it about Trump and thus not about tolerance and respect but politics and personal preference.  They demonstrate in their writing exactly what they are admonishing others not to do."
Nice strawman.  Never once suggested that.  Simply pointed out we've got a kettle calling a pot black.  Try to keep up.

How does this work?

Do the US Armed Forces function as some sort of giant civil rights organization?

Black people were still riding at the back of the bus after the big WWII victory.

Women were not allowed full voting rights at the end of WWI.

Were US troops sent to Vietnam so that Americans could be free to send letters to the editor?

Is there any case in which the US Armed Forces have been sent to distant lands on a mission to protect freedom of speech?

Is protecting freedom of speech even part of training scenarios?

"So is this level of service @ the $1,500 level, or the $5,000 level?

Beyond that, the person is a Chinese citizen in China, which is the start and finish of it..

While I do not hope for this specifically, I can't wait for the day (as a test case) that a Canadian born individual, emigrates to another country (one they have no ancestral or ethnic ties to), perhaps not one that Canada shares a lot with (pick an African, Asian, or Latin American Country, NOT say Australia), and then comes back to Canada (perhaps a visit) and apparently commits a crime.

Would the say, Malawian or Uruguayan government protest to Canada that ""Hey! he's a citizen of OUR country - Release him!"" be given any weight in Canada?"
"What nonsense. The ""all lives matter"" meme attempts to communicate that black lives are not the only lives that matter - nothing else.

"Christopher Columbus was a man of his time. Sure what he did to the Indians were wrong by our standards today but they weren't so wrong by his standards back then. And yeah, Columbus didn't discovered the new world. I think the Vikings, Chinese and even Africans or Romans may have beaten him to the punch. And Indians immigrated to North and South Americas long before from the Asiatic continent. But Columbus did discovered the new world for the Europeans and opened up this world for the Europeans and their descendants. People like Elise are here because of Columbus and if she think Columbus did wrong, she can pack her bags and go back to Italy. Without Columbus, she won't be here. This is liberal hypocrisy at its worst. Condemning a man from a different time period, but yet taking advantages of what he did. Birth of the  United States is a direct result from actions and behavior of Columbus and his kind. If Columbus was wrong, our nation was wrong....Elise, aren't you pack yet???"
"Using places like Langbaan and Pok Pok as proof that Sen Yai should have no problem charging $11 for noodles is a mistake.  Langbaan and Pok Pok are black swans.  You can't use them as indicators of what's normal.  Pok Pok came on the scene with perfect timing, moving from cart to restaurant and garnering tons of press both local and national.  I see more Ubers in front of that place than many downtown steakhouses.  A good number of their customers go there to say they went to Pok Pok, not because they have a palate that begs for traditional and unusual Thai dishes.  Same with Langbaan (which has like 10 seats).

What they should have done was call it Pok Pok Noodle House to get some of those foodies to follow the brand in the door."

"Blatant insensitivity and poor judgement on that big of a scale was rightful grounds to terminate that professor. Are you really defending blackface? 

Just because it doesn't offend you, someone who enjoys the benefits of not being a racial minority (I assume), doesn't give you the right to decide if or if not it's offensive to others. Go ask your black friends if they'd find you putting on blackface for a halloween costume offensive or not.

The intention of the offender doesn't dismiss something being offensive or not. Are there overly PC things that happen? Yes. But blackface is not something that's really debatable as being written off as an ""Oops I'm sorry, I didn't know that was offensive."" For someone who's a professor and makes 150K+ a year especially. I'd have a hard time keeping a barista on staff for that. Hopefully lesson learned and she can continue her very well-to-do career."
"Anthony, the problem is that there is no coherent, singular voice from prominent black athletes. some say its the oppression, some say it is Trump, some say it is the killing of black men by the police.... There is a great opportunity for these people, many of whom are revered by the masses, to use their position to get the message across. But they chose to get behind a bad role model (remember Kaepernicks 'pig socks'? they are offensive to anyone who respects the police) and then doubled down by disrespecting the flag. 

Maybe what the NFLPA should  do is select a committee of players to meet with the DOJ to address their concerns as a unified body with one message. then make another committee to discuss the plight of the inner cities and discuss some 'workfare' programs. Then another to talk about educational opportunities.

"Not including TO Police remains as pure 'Bigotry' on the part of Black Lives Matter & those of the Pride community who do not want to allow 'Everyone' to take part.

"It's ""Mr.""

Poverty fell during the 1990s because the economy was good, probably due to technology and the Internet bubble. When the economy went back down in the early 2000s, poverty increased and welfare was not there for people who had exceeded its five year limit. The welfare ""reform"" bill was an attack on poor people, a drastic cut in the safety net they depend on.

The crime bill greatly increased incarceration in this country and was devastating to blacks. They were not happy about it. Last I heard we led the world in the incarceration rate -- or maybe we're second behind China. You can look it up. The ""war on drugs"" was especially destructive. Putting huge number of people in jail does not solve social problems, is very expensive, and the country is now backing away from it.

Al Gore, like the Clintons, was a conservative southern Democrat, and a hawk. By the end of Clinton's term a lot of us were sick of all that, and still are. No sale."

"I used to favor big magnums but got bored. Haven't hunted since 78. Then I decided recently to try black powder muzzle-loaders. Bought a 58cal Kodiak Express double rifle.
120 gr of powder, with a 270 grain lead ball makes it a good brush gun for medium game. 200 gr powder, with 570 gr lead bullet is without a doubt more than enough for a brown, at close range.
They hunt Cape buffalo with these, but use a 600 gr FMJ bullet. Traveling slightly faster than the speed of sound, those big bullets have both penetrating power, and high sectional density.
I don't hunt critters anymore, but it is a fun rifle to shoot. Two barrels give you back-up if a brown comes after you, but reload time is so slow, that it makes you hesitate, until you're really certain that you are in danger.
At the Rabbet Creek range, full loads sounded like cannon, plowed up the berm, smoke filled the shooting area. Bought a stock pad after that experience. Even small ladies would be comfortable with 120/270 light loads."

Specifically, Table 13 of the report (p. 28) lists rates of violations resulting in a jail stay as a proportion of the population of each demographic on probation/parole, whereas Table 14 (p. 30) lists rates of violations resulting in a jail stay as a proportion of the total population of each demographic. 

My main beef with this article is that it seems to suggest that black adults are jailed at a disproportionately high rate because black adults violate probation/parole (resulting in jail stays) at a disproportionately high rate (i.e., data that would be found in Table 13, which fails to show such a lopsided disproportionality), but instead relates the data from Table 14, which seem irrelevant without also taking into account the proportions of each population on probation/parole in the first place."
"The U.S.A. leadership, especially presidents, for 2 centuries have been propelled by irrational HATRED. 
Early leadership hated Native Americans so much they wiped them out in a century of wars, even genocide. 
Then the South's economic success became too much for the North, who suddenly developed hatred of black slavery to justify a war to wipe them out. Lincoln after all was from way North. 
Somehow American leadership developed a deep hatred of Hitler before WW2, even though Nazi Germany have not done a darn thing to hurt America. 
After WW2, unable to wipe out the other winning country the USSR, American leadership suddenly developed insane hatred of Communism, but which they loved during WW2. 
GW Bush is all about hatred of all things Islamic. He tried to wipe it out with war. 
Obama, a black man, suddenly found a resurgent Russia who challenged his Exceptionalism. He tried to war on it, but got defeated. 
And now we have The Donald. He hates China very much. Very very much."
"It is interesting that my post about Conrad Black being expelled from UCC for peddling illegal copies of exams disappeared. That fact is well documented, in multiple sources, including biographies.

"A couple players refusing to stand--who cares--the majority of players in all sports are showing respect for county + values + the national anthem.  I would like to see what these players are really doing something for their ""cause""--aside of refusing to stand.  Just like Colin K--making a big show of ""social justice, equality""--the guy doesn't doesn't even vote--what a returd.  Now if Magic Johnson refuses to stand --then that is something--he has and is doing many things to help black communities and needy communities--but these others--the are just rubbish--i would like to see what they will be doing after they get out of the spotlight--probably lining up for handouts from soup kitchens.  Who is saying the nation anthem should be stopped--what!!! NO way--not even close--why drop of decades long tradition for a few losers...NO WAY.  When the Olympics roll around--what US anthem will be played for the Gold Medal presentation??? ""Whoop there it IS""."
"I've had thoughts that there should something along these lines to encourage welfare recipients to work as seasonal fruit/produce pickers, to offset declining illegal immigrant numbers.  They get a free round trip bus/train ticket to where ever, and if they work for a given period (the whole picking season) in addition to their wages, they get part or all of their welfare benefits.  

We'd be paying them bennies anyway if they sat at home, so I'm not sure it's a loss to taxpayers.  Could possibly allow growers to pay at a reduced wage to encourage participation.  Unfortunately, I can just hear Al Sharpton if a program sent inner city blacks to work on rural farms.  The plantation/slave comparisons would be endless.  Never mind that it might help them, or not be limited to them; the outrage would be overwhelming."
"'Police officers of all races ""are also disproportionately endangered by black assailants,"" and, she says, FBI data over the past decade shows that 40 percent of cop killers were black; that blacks kill police at a rate 2.5 times higher than the rate at which blacks are killed by police.'"
"Black lives matter. Why are there so many black on black homicides? Respect one another first, then others will regard you with respect."

"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.
Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.”
Ungrateful is the new uppity.
Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.
Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
"No, BLM only protests when a cop kills a criminal.   They don't protest about the thousands of black on black murders that happen every year.

So it would follow they are racist, if anyone is."

"That is ridiculous in so many ways that there isn't room to reply adequately.  To begin with, have you ever been to private schools?  And you are lumping in the few private academies with private schools located in many typical neighbor hoods through out the city.  You are also putting typical liberal stigma on blacks and other minorities that they all live in poor neighborhoods with those like them.  I guess my nephews black wife, who grew up in a south suburb wasn't informed that her family was in the wrong neighborhood and needed to move to Montbello.  I suggest you go to Lincoln Academy and see the cross-section of society that attends there.  In the end, you are so narrow minded on this subject that you can see through a keyhole with both eyes."
This guy is a black communist activist if you ask me.
The red states did everything in their power to deny black folks the right to vote. That includes limiting voting locations where many black folks live.
How about being black? Are you fine with that? Something tells me deep down you are not.
People once chose to believe black humans were property. They minimized it in their minds to conceal and deal with the legal crime of their time.
Another case of black at the wrong time.

"I think what we have here is a case when a coach gets so frustrated at the fact that his team (which he as probably seen play very aggressive against teams that mirror them) got on the court against a predominately if not all African American Team and wanted no parts of the competition physically. In a attempt to say hey fellas its basketball, hello!!! don't be afraid of them cause they don't look like you. Please fellas it can't be because they don't look like you. Damn it, it is. I can't believe this ish! Can you envision the frustration a coach could have if he believes his team is not playing defense because they don't want to touch a kid that is umm ""black."" Is this a far fetched assumption by coach Adelman? Did he handle it correctly, not sure but......"
"Exactly. The ""not guilty"" verdict brought black neighborhoods close to riot. Obama spoke calmly and sensibly; Obama poured oil on troubled waters, soothing the unhappy situation. Trump on the other hand, has doubled down on his truly nasty characterization of black athletes protesting police brutality and murder against ""their people"" (remember that most of those athletes come from disadvantaged neighborhoods) and in fact, as anyone can plainly see today, further divided our nation of blamers and finger-pointers.

Obama didn't ""screw up"", you and millions of other bigots who loudly proclaimed ""the black kid deserved to die"" REALLY screwed up. And all from the relative safety of your barcolounger, where you judge the world in all your heralded wisdom. No doubt you get tremendous satisfaction every time a creep with a gun shoots down an unarmed black kid. I know I'm right, there."

"Good on Curry.  Too often this man has used (black) people as props.  I recall the visit of the presidents of the HBCs -historically black colleges - who reported  after they left that they felt used for photo-ops because there was nothing of substance discussed, they were misled about the reason for the meeting. 

BTW, I hope every black/brown player takes a knee at every game- college, high school, NFL, etc.- for the rest of the reason.  Let the so-called president of the U.S. continue to call their mothers b****s."
"As usual, Jenkins makes no sense.  Polling showed Obama, at the time of the 2016 election, was far more popular than either candidate running. Further, elections showed race being an important factor as some blacks who made the effort to vote for Obama failed to do so for a non black.  There were extremely few people that Trump could have defeated, and Obama was not one of them."

How about the black Chicago Judge killed in his driveway today?  Does his life matter?  

None of them were killed by Trump voters or police officers as near as we can tell.  Do their lives still matter?

Hold off  on answering,   We don't know yet if the dead eight-year old is black or not.    Lots of the kids in the class were.

According to the DOJ, blacks commit over half of all murders despite the fact that they make up about 13% of the US population. The media likes to downplay black murders with the narrative that blacks primarily only kill other blacks. This is just not true. About 9-10% of all murders committed in the USA are blacks killing non-blacks."

An excellent question. I think further action is warranted. Don't you? I think Trudeau should show his commitment to diversity and step down and allow a woman to lead the Liberal party and Canada.

"What happened in Furguson ? What happened in Baltimore last time ?  The mayor even ordered the police to stand down and let what group burn down the town ?  I'm a law abiding person and it ticks me off when one group gets away with looting and destroying property nearly every time they feel justice wasn't fair.  Why does only one group of Americans feel they are justified in mass looting and destruction of property every time things don't go their way ?  Why do you call me a name for stating the obvious ?  In New York Black Lives Matters people were chanting they wanted police killed.  Obama told the nation "" police acted stupidly "" in the D.C. case which was code for all police are bad or to be questioned.  He implied they weren't the hero's they are for keeping us safe. How does stealing TV's and everything else they can grab like a pack of rabid dogs ( have you seen the security tapes ? ) make up for a a court decision they disagree with ?  What do you call them ?"

"It is quite clear from the GuptaLeaks that the Guptas quickly assessed jacob zuma to be a greedy, gullible, ignorant but canny prick and played on those non-attributes to the hilt. Were I a Black South African citizen, I would be insulted and deeply offended that the president of the country could be so easily duped and 'captured' and that he would assume that I and all my fellow citizens are classed in the same categories: ignorant, stupid, gullible as well as blind, deaf and dumb, to allow the Guptas to rape 'us' all financially. It seems that I, a fellow citizen – unlike my Black friend – and others who think like me, live in quite a different universe where we know that much of what is going on in Zuptaland (including in the African National Congress) is wrong, indefensible and terribly harmful to the nation and all its peoples.

Oh yeah, that's right, though it has real flaws that could be corrected, the ACA like a lot of other things from the Obama years must be bad simply because That Black Man brought it in while he ruined America.

Because she was older than 13, she also had to go through filing fees, fingerprinting, background checks with the CBI and FBI (not a big deal, just took weeks), and publication, new birth cert and SSN. Publication wasn't a big deal, just a small notification that ran in some obscure local paper for a week or two. Do people actually read those kinds of notices? Of course, I had to inform my insurance company and a host of other notifications. Yeah, it's a nuisance more than financial burden, but why is your daughter more special than mine or more special than anybody else who has to go through it? And what does being transgender have to do with it? Please get over yourselves. This is life."

The baker is choosing to be offended. 

Is the baker going to ask people if they are gay before agreeing to make a custom cake?
He is being a petty child.

So what if you think the cake is art? I am not going to argue that with you. 
Do you think artists are allowed to discriminate?

If an artist sells to the general public, the artist can not discriminate against protected classes.
If the baker wins, it will be legal to discriminate based on religion. I guarantee you black people will be denied service somewhere on religious grounds. 

You can make all the semantic arguments you want. The baker discriminated, no one is arguing that. 
He offers custom cakes to divorcees and adulterers, but not to homosexuals. He is a hypocrite."
Do the newspapers report the race of a cop who shoots a deadly gangster black guy?  YES THEY ALWAYS DO.  The only reason not to show a picture and report the race is RACISM to hide the TRUE FACTS.

"@jerry69, here is some spin from an 1855 letter of Abraham Lincoln's:

“As a nation, we began by declaring that ‘all men are created equal.’ We now practically read it ‘all men are created equal, except negroes.’ When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ‘all men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.’ When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty—to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.”

Know-Nothings refers to the American Party, which didn't want Irish Catholics fleeing the potato famine to enter the country.  People thought women were held against their will in Catholic convents and that priests systematically raped nuns and then strangled any children born as a result of their union.

See the comparison?"

And, after Tuesday and Wednesday, it's clear he should be in the desert.

He doesn't do well in Coastal (D. C.), or urban (NYC), pasture (NJ), or mountainous (Reno) areas.   When he's there, he either says really, really, really stupid things (Charlottesville stuff, ""fire and fury"" and just about everything else), or has a flat, robotic presentation (Reno teleprompter speech,  Afgahnistan announcement).  

He's in his element in the desert (ARIZONA!).  Exposing the fake, lying press; clarifying the truth, and showing off Ben Carson to let America know Black people are. . . OK!

So, he should personally supervise the building of the wall along the Mexican/US DESERT border.

Build in the desert.  Where our President can be at his best.

With the way he can whip up his base, I have no doubt they would respond to his call to show up, and then get the thing done in a jiffy.

"I'd still like to know where you're getting your information because the facts are different. You say race relations have gone downhill. Is that an anecdotal observation, is it reflection of your fear of those different from yourself or can you cite some reference? You're blaming protests on Obama. How about police shootings? According to the FBI from 2008 through 2012, 51% of the people killed by police were black men. (Black men are a little over 7% of the US) This past July Philando Castile, a 32 year old gainfully employed black man was shot to death with his girlfriend and 4 year old daughter in the car after being pulled over for a busted tail light. Prior to that he had been stopped 52 times in 14 years. His crime? Being born black. How many times have you been stopped by the police? How is clamping down on people who want to be treated equally (Trump's plan) going to make things better? It sure as hell didn't work in the 60s. Why will it work now?"

It was the post-emancipation Jim Crow laws of some Southern States that said if your heritage was 1/8 or more negro, then you were considered a negro. Hopefully we have moved past that, but looking at your comments perhaps not.

Steph Curry is clearly of less than 1/2 black heritage. He is American, end of discussion. It is okay to refer to Obama as the first African-American president, because he was. However, he should not be called the first black American president, because he was only 1/2 black."

Ever since the voters in Alaska smote Joe Miller with the jaw bone of an ass the GOP leadership has worried that they have ""lost control"" of a minion.
Fully 51% of GOP voters DO NOT KNOW that the ACA they are using and "" Obama Care"" are one and the same. Trump says he loves the uneducated voter, this is why, it's so much easier to pull the wool over their eyes and give tax breaks to his donor's.

"David Brooks: ""Those who believe in open believe in open trade, relatively open immigration, an active foreign policy and racial integration. Those who believe in closed believe in protective trade, closed borders, a withdrawn foreign policy and ethnic separatism.""

""Open trade"" that was all about giving more power to multinational corporations so they could move their factories to low-wage countries and sell the products back to US consumers.

""Relatively open immigration"" to provide more cheap labor for the corporations.

""Active foreign policy"" that was all about perpetual war to advance US ""interests"" that were clearly not mine, using working-class kids who have no better options to do the fighting.

""Racial integration"" using cops to kill blacks.

Not denying racism remains a problem and I understand why a race accustomed to being mocked and assaulted would be overtly defensive.   I just think this became a mistake of 'friendly fire' that hit the wrong person."

Are black lives matter terrorist's when they take over a city and burn and loot. When they terrorize and threaten students who put up a Blue lives matter display tear it down and physically enforce their views. Are they terrorists? If a bunch of ranchers being crushed by federal officials take over a building out in the boonies and don't burn and loot are terrorists should not black lives matter who do burn and loot be classified as terrorists. If those farmers and ranchers were all black would they be called terrorist's.

It may not be significant to you, but it is to plenty of people who have a generational history here.

"The problem is not that a disproportionate amount of blacks are being killed, but rather that people are being oppressed and killed wrongly/illegally by police. The 4th amendment prohibits detainment, arrests, searches, even the request for identification (""papers""), without the explicit warrant based on wrong doing.  The 5th prohibits the deprivation of life, liberty and property, w/out due process.  Instead, police are trained, and implement being judge, jury, and executioner.  In their confused minds, they see the people as criminal and in need of such execution, without considering that people have the right to live without interaction with police, unless there is a warrant.  And even when there is, the police still have no right to kill (ie. deprivation of life) unless a death sentence has been handed down, per supreme law.  If the police feel threatened (and they will with their approach, as they threaten the people), they should take cover, and not murder.Bigots then get away..."
"Too bad Saunders accepts Cemil Aydin‘s misplaced notion of “race” to sensationalize what is otherwise an interesting discussion of the history of Islamic identity. From a biological perspective, race cannot be applied to physical variation among Homo sapiens because there is a single human race. Race, as applied to humans, is a deeply flawed social invention reducing biological variation to the twin variables of skin colour and geographical ancestry. 

To apply it to religious variation in order to portray Muslims as despised underdogs only adds confusion to the debate over what it means to be an adherent of the faith while unfairly labelling non-Muslims as knuckle-walking racists."
"As I seem to recall, the only time the Trump campaign was seriously knocked off course was when the 10 year old video surfaced of Trump making gross comments about groping women.

Yet given all that (presumably whatever happened actually doesn't matter) we still have the ""War on Women"". (And I could cite other examples of men being fired over making offensive comments, etc. But I'll leave it at that.)

"Substitute ""black"" for ""gay."" How does that sound? 

From all my experience with gay friends and a family member, I am convinced that people are born with a particular sexual orientation, thus created by God to be the way they are.  (Facing all the historical hatred and discrimination, who would choose to be gay??)

The Catholic Church doesn't need to compromise. It needs to pay attention to almost fifty years of scientific studies on homosexuality. 

Currently, the Church's position on the subject is as ridiculous as its treatment of Galileo.  

Using a verse in a 3,000-year-old document to understand and legislate on human sexuality  is in the same category as all those Catholics --including clergy-- who supported and justified slavery and Jim Crow because of Paul's epistle to Philemon."

Jesus said he did not come to abolish the law.  The Scriptures tell us the true Christian is the one who loves his brother and keeps the commandments.

"The world is over populated.... so why is Canada encouraging more mass immigration?

In the future Canada's greatest asset will be it's low population. If high population is bad for them why is it good for us? It is a myth that Canada can keep on expanding, we do not need replacement workers, people will live longer in the future and be able to work longer too.

In countries like India, China, Africa they are no Christian. They are not obsessed with death, sex and marriage. Children are raised communally and in a village Overpopulation is not the problem as over globalization. The problem starts when everyone in Africa started buying western junk and living the western greed-dream. So this Canadian problem to promote abortion is very suspicious.

"Politifact is not a reliable source, especially with respect to 19th-century US History.

Lincoln clearly wanted to deport blacks from the US after the War.

And Booth managed to murder the man who could have treated the South much better than the Bloody Shirt Republicans ever did.  Lincoln probably would have treated the South with charity rather than malice;  consequently, many of the problems extant today would not have occurred.

See his speeches also.  Especially in Southern Illinois Lincoln went to great lengths to express his general disdain for blacks. The political Lincoln tempered that view when he spoke to audiences in Northern Illinois.

The Emancipation Proclamation also showed Lincoln's political dexterity.  He used that decree to kept the French &
British from recognizing the South.  But he only proscribed slavery where the Yanks did not have control.  Where the Yanks were in power/Border States slavery was kept legal.

Lincoln was a good politician and a blatant racist."
"Bud Black did a great job this year and the Rockies Management, I believe, never thought they were going to be a playoff team at the start.

McGee ended up pitching to just one batter and Dunn was never used. That's why managers have gray hair. Great job overall though considering where they were this time last year."
"The idea that Jefferson thought of blacks as only 5/7 human is, of course, a canard.  The representatives of the Northern States were trying to have a union without slavery, and they rightly resented the Southern States have slaves be represented the population for purposes of national representation, when they weren't even free and couldn't vote in State elections.  It was like allowing California's illegal alien population to count toward how many representatives it should be allowed in Congress.  So they reached the 5/7 compromise."

Now, let's grant this much:  Catholics can't really expect everyone not schooled in Catholic thinking to believe in ensoulment from the moment of conception.   Got that.  STILL, who in his right mind believes that killing a child just a few days short of birth is different from killing a born-alive baby?  Yet, this is what Clinton supports.  And she will appoint a Supreme Court who sees it her way.  Granting that Trump would be the worst President ever --- and I do believe he would be --- how could we justify electing Clinton?   We would be horrified if asked to vote for a President who would authorize the enslavement of, say, 3,000 black people.  Such a person should never be elected, no matter what else.  How, then, could we vote for Clinton, given her stance on partial birth abortion?"

He will try to distract the people by outrageous tweets and by the games he plays, but people are starting to stand up more then ever. We have much too lose. For example, how the world view the US. If we pull out of the Paris Accord we are telling the world that our treaty's to other countries means nothing to us anymore. Same thing goes with NATO and other countries we Militarily support. For example S Korea would be invaded by N Korea and that could destabilize the world economy. I think this time things will different then other President's because if Trump goes along with those around him, he will be making the following very angry - Blacks, Muslims, Native American, LGBT community, Public school teachers, women, immigrants, the elderly, the disable, middle class, poor and I sure I missed a few groups. But you get the point."
"You misread what I said. It isn't the act of disobeying that is in question. It is the act of doing something in a provocative manner while disobeying. If the man with his hands up simply refused to sit down, he wouldn't have been shot. The issue was he had his hands up and was refusing to stop what he was doing. The real question in this one will be if he was reaching into the window. If he refused to stop while having his hands up and reached into his window, then yes, he deserved what he got. If the window was up and he simply leaned against the car, then no, he shouldn't have been. Two officers reacted in the exact same way at the exact same time, leading me to believe the window was down and he was reaching for something. Though that is speculation on my part. 

I don't believe there is a war on black people and that police are intentionally shooting black people. That is nonsense. If he would've stopped when ordered to, the situation wouldn't have escalated to that point. Period."

All these protests are about Trump's conduct.  And that's not worth disrespecting your country.

They see it every day and their own experience forewarn them of what to expect and who they are at greatest risk from. Your son is collateral damage in the collapse of black urban culture. Despite being 15% of the population (yup that's all) even you must grasp how much of society's problems stem from fatherless black kids running wild."
"Will he demand reparations for   black drug dealers who wind up in prison, torn from the bosom of their loved ones, families and homes? Perhaps an inquiry into murdered and missing black drug dealers?"
"It's a word that seems to set progressives off, in that they condemn the police, while the statistics disprove BLM's contentions.

Meanwhile, the rate of murder in black communities is sky high.    I know progressives like yourself don't want to hear that, but some of us think that BLM is a foolish distraction from the tragedy of black on black crime."
How many times has that flag been flown over a lynched black man?
"Other than being black and having plastic coverings, what is your definition of an ""assault weapon""."
"Exactly right. And with being the first female president preceded by the first black president; not being female or black being the crime, but both being totally inept for the job by being voted ""first"", we will be nailing the final nails in our country's cofffin.

"Not all Republicans are racists. However, they are all collaborators with racists. They are like the ""good Germans"" that never asked, where did the Jews disappear to? Today, they never question why cops kill so many unarmed black  people, including children."
It also smacks of racism. It paints a picture of  a black man Needing an escort to safely navigate the area and ensure his safety from all of those kids. Ridiculous.
So are black masked  violent afascist  Bolsheviks running  the streets while police stand down our new politically correct  heroes were supposed to worship from now on?
"It's not my ""logic""...it's historical FACT.  First black, COURT ORDERED, in 1655, as a slave was John Casor who had left the indenture of Anthony Johnson and going to work for a neighbor telling him his indenture had ended.  The Court, after finding for the neighbor, reversed itself, and awarded Casor to life as a slave to Johnson.  Johnson, himself, was a black Angolan who had been captured by a neighboring tribe, sold to Arab slave traders and ended up in Virginia.  After gaining HIS freedom, he became rather well to do, and have several ""indentured"" individuals working his farm.  but Casor was the 1st black ""slave"" documented by court action.  So, Johnson, a black former ""indentured"" individual took possession of John Casor for life, another black, as a slave.  Why is it I know more about your history than do you?  Perhaps you really DO need to do some research, other than the liberal brainwashing you have been subjected to!  You denegrate the accomplishments of your own people. Sad"

How about saying something like, fifty years from now people will look back on these dark ages like we do now over prohibition, which is entirely more accurate to the event. We are a nation of laws (or we used to be) it is what has separated us from banana republics that we are currently becoming. People choose to either follow laws that our legislative branch authors in the form of a bill and our executive branch signs into law or not, the choice is theirs. If you can not do the time do not do the crime and if you do not agree with the law work to change it.

"I had to move to California for an education that is not available at UAA. No way that I want to go to a college that is building new bullshit buildings and $110 million sports arenas while cutting the only reason we go to school, to get an education! I love the teachers there, but forget paying for some stupid sports and buildings, thinking that this will make people want to move to Alaska for college. Nobody moves to Alaska because one of the pros is that we have a new freaking arena. A great education in my interested field of study is why I would move for school. Not to mention the basketball coach obviously doesn't like black people and everyone knows it. These people who make financial decisions should get schooled by us because this is ridiculous. Do sports make a profit? Does our new arena make a profit? How many kids moved to Alaska to attend UAA because we have sports teams and a new arena?

"If there's ""anti-Muslim hate"", is it really that some Canadians, out of all the dozens of ""tribes"" to come to Canada over the decades, just randomly and for no particular reason picked Muslims to dislike?  Or maybe some Muslims need to look in the mirror, and realize it might be because women are second class citizens in all Muslim societies (I do ""hate"" that), or maybe it's that some Muslims have proclaimed they hate the West and are inflicting terror to bring it down, or maybe because Muslims make it clear that Islam is first and Canada and all else is second, or maybe because the ""good"" Muslims don't march en masse when the ""bad"" ones kill infidels, or maybe it's because seeing a woman dressed head to toe in a black veil in public sends a bit of a chill through a modern woman, or maybe we'd like to see more integration efforts and less accommodation demands, or maybe just because when my I knock on my Muslim neighbour's door it opens just a crack and all I see is a covered face."
"Yes, where was he when Black Lives matter was marching in the streets and screaming ""cops are pigs, fry them like bacon"", (or something like that). I heard crickets from the former President.

I am, however, protective of a person's right to be racist and wear whatever offensive costume he or she wants at a private party.  Shame on her, but she is allowed.

The military has long been a social experiment. Just ask Blacks, Filipinos, Asian, Chicano, etc. Americans who were treated terribly in the military, as a lesser being. A ""rigid moral standard"" is what Chelsa Manning and other displayed when they exposed the lack of moral integrity in the AMERICAN Government actions at the highest level.

"I haven't seen anything that shows Trump will improve black people as a group.  I don't think he really thinks in 'interest group' think unless someone points him in that direction.  He really seems to think that his brilliance will help everyone.    

I see Hillary and Bill pandering to get votes from black people with all sorts of promises, but they will promise anyone anything to get a vote, even if two simultaneous promises are mutually exclusive.   They don't really expect to have to come through, except for those providing their money.  THOSE promises MUST be kept or the money spigot will quit."
Black males account for 3-4% of the general population and are responsible for between 25 and 50 percent of some categories of violent crime. This would be a good place to start.
"I don't know if I would call it a boycott.   I would say that black voters didn't see either candidate as somebody who would listen to their voices.   

But very rationally, I think you're right.   They couldn't vote with the racial overtones of the Trump campaign and they just didn't like Hillary very much.    She is 'the system', black Americans wanted a friend.   We'd all like a President that shares our core values."
"Important point Westslope, additionally the supposed reason to take a knee is to protest the ""inequality"" in the U.S. today. 
This, of course, coming from Black players that make up 75% of the players in the league, and make millions of dollars a year!
I think they should start ""equality"" by giving me half of their millions net worth just to make us, you know, equal.  Then we should implement an affirmative action program that will require owners to only employ ""others"" until at least 50% of the players are non-Blacks.
Then we can go to the NBA were 11 out of 13 players on every team are Black.  This is a clear sign of discrimination and racism being perpetuated against ""others"" and must again have a affirmative action program mandated and a hiring freeze put in place until at least 7 out of 13 players in the NBA are others, (penalizing the teams by one player to cover past racist transgressions).  Lebron should give me half of his earnings too, so, ya know, that we are ""equal""."

Are you serious?
Never wider?  You do know that black codes and Jim Crow prevented Afro Americans from voting and many other things, right?  You do understand that segregation had a major effect on the Afro American development after being freed from slavery?  Our nation has in fact been more racially divided than it is today.

“Are we reverting to the '60s when police officers were often seen as the enemy?”  
Really?
You reference the 1960s and then ask if the police will have targets on their backs.  Do you know what was happening to Afro Americans in the 1960s?  As a former police officer I stand amazed at some of the actions taken by officers in the 1960s."
A Democrat who thinks of a Republican as lowlife simply can not help but make a tainted article about a Republican.  Much the same way as a KKK on Blacks.
"Maxie, where were you the last eight years. The rich did very well, whereas the middle class did poorly, especially Blacks. We did see a huge increase in food stamps, but that's not a measure of economic success. Blue collar workers, and in fact, everyone who wants to work should do very well under Trump. Time will tell. By the way, who do you believe supported Hillary? It was the elite liberals. Most of the wall street campaign funds went to Hillary; a very small percentage to Trump. You should do a little more research on Hillary. Trump and his family are sacrificing their time and money to help you."

BLM needs to make cops the bad guys as their raison d'etre or else they slide away into irrelevance. Cops were happy to take part and enjoy pride . Now they are being demonized. BLM looks like a racist organizations that apparently does not actually care about black lives-and that is the worst part of all this. What's next black hoods ?
"At some point rationality is less important than gut feelings, and in my gut, I feel as I did in the 60's when America murdered so many of the left and delighted in electing Nixon twice. Electing Nixon may  have been through fair elections, but it stopped being my America, and started being rule by the anti-union 1%.
This is Putin's win. He will soon be able to invade Ukraine.
It is Netanyahu's win, he and his followers are already being quoted as saying the idea of a Palestinian State is dead.
This is a win for those who hate Roe V. Wade, and women's reproductive rights, or gay rights. It was won by shutting down American government, hating the black man in office for seven years, and making sure poor Americans didn't have jobs or health care. 

So those who delight in this election...a compassionless gloating crew...enjoy your time in the sun. We who hate Trump and how he won are frightened of you, and many of us would move out of the country if we could.

"I really was not sure about if you felt racism was still present?   You mentioned that the flag represent the United States. but does it represent a nation equal opportunity or equal application of the law?    The answer for many black citizens, based on their family history and experiences, is No.   

So my question becomes, if racism still exist in the United States, does the flag also reflects a nation that continues to have significant amount of racism.    Maybe that's our disconnect?   You see the flag as an ideal, others see the reality of race bias.*

I agree that action is more important than words.    The protest while improving awareness of stubborn racial discrimination, may have created more resistance than help?    We won't know for awhile.   I have no problem with the protest.

"Using this reasoning, Muhammad Ali should have quit boxing in 1967 rather than take the political positions he did. He missed three years when he was stripped of his title and denied his opportunity to compete while he was in his absolute prime. Many of his most memorable fights happened after the Supreme Court unanimously overturned his bogus conviction on draft evasion. Opposing the Vietnam War, advancing social justice, and bringing attention to the oppression of black people were far more important to Ali than merely being The Greatest. For him, being The Greatest involved using his platform to change society for the better, even at the cost of many more victories in the ring, millions of dollars, and the temporary approval of ""mainstream"" society. I agree with your evaluation of Bennett being a five star prospect  for his post-football life, but it's smart on his part to use his 15 minutes (relatively speaking) of fame, to bring attention to issues more important than football."

"the urgency from Ms Klein about a world not heeding her sage advice on how best to order itself, born out of her deep personal experience in politics, industry, business, science, or even so little as the building of a better mousetrap, comes, one can't help assuming, from her growing recognition that she may very well pass from this earth before her own particular rebranded style of collectivist nonsense gets another chance at destroying the lives and aspirations of so many many people....driven by a deep self proclaimed love of mankind mind you...it always is ,

"Yet, the prejudice is not simply towards the Russian state, and is directed by many people towards anyone suspected of being Russian, or who doesn't post or support anti-Russia comments. Claims of somebody being Russian (though, I expect that 98%+ of those accused of being Russian in comments sections are not Russian at all) are used as a tool to discount what the person has to say, and to attack them. So, it truly is real racism, because it is disregarding and discrimination precisely on the premise of race.

A lot of people just try to rationalize their racism to justify themselves to be able to say the discriminatory things they want to. But that doesn't change that attacking somebody and suggesting that their views are invalid on the premise of their race being Russian is racism, and is no different than a Nazi doing the same to somebody who is Jewish because they are Jewish, or a KKK calling a black person's views not of equal value."
"Congrats to the Pride community for standing up for principle!
In the LGBT community, and especially in the black community, police power is often correctly seen as abusive and designed to protect property rather than people. Systemic racism in policing has been well established for two decades, and marginalized communities feel it.
Apoplectic critics such as this editorialist who moan about spending public money on Pride should think a) that the police don't need protection, b) that Pride is a huge community event featuring minority populations, and c) that the taxpayer can save the money the TPS would spend on float and booth propaganda.
Gay and lesbian cops who want to participate will still be welcome, I'm sure."
"You are making some assumptions that are simply incorrect. I do not practice law as you imply. I respect your views even though you seem to be on the verge of personal attacks.

And I heard many complain that had they known before then they would have also. Not condoning the unfairness or any homophobic justification. It is a rule that is often abused but more often makes for a more fair outcome when unprovable but real bias is present. Nobody said anything about screening out blacks or Jews or females. Those are your words and the implications and assumptions are not warranted.

"Hadd makes his case that he surveyed women he met in person, online and even friends and family, discovering that none of those he asked could answer the question ""Why were women marching?"" Did he ask a marcher?
Then Hadd tells us why the women marched: ""they somehow think because they didn’t get their female president, that all rights afforded to women will magically disappear."" By using the term ""female president"" in that sentence Hadd plays his card: He thinks the march was about just wanting a woman president.
As a segue, Hadd let's loose his other issues, connecting his first assumption about why women marched (wanted a woman president) by saying it's ""sort of""  how minorities believed their lives would be vastly improved under an African-American president.""
So now Hadd has spoken for women, identified their issue and decided what minorities think too.

"Mr. Marshall, if you can't go all the way and boycott the NFL, and especially after what it's doing to your longtime friend Colin, who risked everything in standing up for what he believed was right, then the NFL owners ""black balling"" him, you taking another knee for the cause for another year, becomes pretty superficial. 


Look at what Colin was willing to risk Mr. Marshall, and all you can do is hold his hand while cashing that big NFL paycheck with the other hand! Dedicated to the cause? Not even. Got to serve somebody! 

In light of the call for a boycott by the NAACP and black ministers, it's kind of an easy, half-heart approach, one that is more about your receiving personal attention, as well as that big NFL paycheck, than truly believing in the cause. I guess the money is much more important than the cause itself. It's no longer about something greater than money like your country and bringing change, it's all about you!


More window dressing, little substance, I reckon."
"Was Colin Kaepernick's Muslim Girlfriend Behind Protest? 
A recent report indicates that Colin Kaepernick’s Muslim girlfriend Nessa Diab was behind his decision to not stand during the national anthem.
The report from sports gossip blog Terez Owens states, “As the entire world knows by now, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the National Anthem in Friday’s pre-season game against Green Bay because he was protesting ‘black oppression’ in the United States. We’re now hearing that it was actually his girlfriend Nessa’s idea for Colin to protest. Colin and his girlfriend, Nessa Diab, an MTV DJ, are still planning an Islamic-style wedding.

"your source is an anti Muslim web site with no supportive information from police is Sweden.  Pants on fire lie.  What we’re hearing is a very, very extreme exaggeration based on a few isolated events, and the claim that it’s related to immigration is more or less not true at all,” says Jerzy Sarnecki, a criminologist at Stockholm University who has devoted his career to the study of criminality, ethnicity and age.

Sweden does indeed have far more reported cases of sexual assault than any other country. But it’s not because Swedes – of any colour – are very criminal. It’s because they’re very feminist.

"The early ""false morels"" have the solid stem that goes up inside the cap. I usually just break off the cap and discard the stems and then saute them in butter, garlic salt and black pepper like regular morels. My thinking is that really cooking them thoroughly possibly cooks off some of the poisons? There seems to be more popping when the false morels are frying suggesting that some kind of gas is being liberated. Have a friend who is desperately allergic to any mushrooms so we have to be very careful that servers in restaurants understand that. Some people are more sensitive to substances that others aren't affected by in the least ala the recent gluten, peanut, corn, milk etc allergies that seem to be proliferating. Luckily I have never been affected by ingesting any mushrooms so far but wouldn't advise anyone to ingest mushrooms that you aren't absolutely certain of. Morels are so scrumptious that I prefer eating them straight up and not mixed into any dish. Side dish delicious."

"That's sad if you really feel the police are the bad guys . Without them murder and crime would be off the charts.  You should know it goes way beyond just police investigating police. In Furguson Obama had dozens of justice department people flown in to try and hang the policeman there. The facts proved that death justified as well , yet the good policeman's life is ruined forever  Look how the authorities in Baltimore tried to hang their policemen and woman. There too justice prevailed .  Things started going bad for police when Obama told the nation police acted stupidly in the D.C. case before even knowing the facts---giving police across America a black eye and encouraging people of color to distrust and disrespect police.  As with every profession there are a few bad apples . However , the number of good police is perhaps 99.9 percent or greater . If you sleep well at night, thank a policeman who is out there covering your back. Police are hero's and the good guys in America."

"Charles ...not everyone looks to the government to pay all of their bills and supply them with every one of life's little pleasures ...pay their power/rent/daycare/buy their food/day care/health care. They also don't value their own lives based upon what the government thinks its value is. When rural people fall on hard times they don't start crying for another government program to take care of them ... they look at each other and they look first at themselves first. Secondly, rural people may seem poor to a stranger looking from outside but most of those families think they live blessed lives and even find a way to give to other people. Poverty is a state of mind and people are responsible for their own happiness ...not the government. Don't you see how the left uses black people every 2 years then kick them to the curb in favor of the next up and coming victim class ...Hispanics!

"Cyril's comments are not particularly radical, in fact most people would subscribe to them. The one thing most rural people don't want though is land. Experience with land restitution thus far indicates that between 70% and 90% of recipients of returned land opt to take the money instead. I have a feeling that the land requirements of all black people genuinely wanting to farm as a profession could be easily met from existing stocks of state or ""tribal"" land. The Government has shown little desire to re-distribute land - it just wants to nationalise it"

If it goes this way and these kids are convicted in federal court,  I have ZERO sympathy for them and if the feds give them the death penalty, so be it.   With HPD ruderless and the former chief and his prosecutor wife up for numerous felony charges in federal court, the criminal element on Oahu has taken full advantage and rules of law and civility to the level of attacks and murder have become the norm.

"This article along with the boomer author belongs in the 20th century. The Alt-Right wants an ethno-state. That entho-state will be far more socialistic compared to today's America. This is due to racially and culturally homogeneous societies having far more social cohesion compared to multi racial and cultural societies. Capitalism thrives during periods of chaos. It is the nihilistic materialism of baby boomers such as the one who wrote this article which is fueling the Alt-Right.  You have flooded America with Blacks and Hispanics who keep voting for bigger government and now are confused as to why you have not been able to conserve one thing. Alternatively, stop complain about university professors brainwashing your children into leftism. After all, you have had them for the first 18 years, whilst the professors have had them for 3 years.

"Sporting News article 10/12/17, ""NFL viewership is down more than 7% through Week 5 versus 2016. Game attendance is down 18% through Week 5 compared to 2015."" SN article further noted that the average NFL viewership per game lost 3.2M viewers compared to 2015. Every NFL dollar lost the players lose 48 cents. Sporting News survives, in large part, based on their NFL coverage. The periodical's reporting was objective. The MSM continues their NFL players propaganda lovefest. 

The National Anthem ""protests"" are sad and pathetic racial politics. MSM propaganda erroneously misreports the players 1A rights in a private company. NFL needs to stop the NA because it offends the NFL players and creates a ""hostile work environment"". The CBA expires soon and the owners can decimate the players financially. The players create the financial losses for their own racial identity politics. The players can keep throwing the ""Black Power"" salute in the NFL's workplace. Yet the MSM blindly defends it."

"Nice try again but all an educated person has to do is point out one flaw or contradiction and your whole premise falls apart. You mention Cyprian but what what your RCC sources fail to mention is that when Stephen, then bishop of Rome attempts to wrestle control in the 3rd century, Cyprian called a council of 87 north African bishops specifically to deny his bogus claims of authority.  RCC authors neglect to tell you that Cyprian believed all bishops were the successor of Peter together, representing one united ""episcopal throne"" (On the Unity of the Church 4-5). Instead, they quote his comments about Peter as though he meant the bishop of Rome. So to him, and to all the bishops of north Africa, there was no pope, not even 200 years after the apostles. 

Sorry to disappoint you TC but you have indeed been sold a bill of goods by clever Roman apologists, still trying to wrestle ""mind control"" of the masses-- albeit significantly harder for them to achieve in modern times... good luck!"

Charter schools are always a difficult situation. On one extreme you have corporations looking to turn a profit, and religions and idealogues looking to undermine public education. On the other extreme we have parents just looking for a better solution to their child's education. Long-term, those two agendas are often diametrically opposed to each other. Short-term, maybe not so much. My point is that turning over public facilities to charter schools is a slippery slope... in the long term."

"No, you don't. I've been to dozens of peaceful protests, and no one EVER brought weapons or shields. I'll bet you've never been part of a peaceful protest in your miserable life.

They threw urine on journalists. They threatened unarmed church leaders and worshipers, barricading them inside a church. They terrorized the innocent, unarmed, law-abiding residents of Charlottesville. They antagonized and threatened black residents of a housing project. Even their ""invitations"" to the event encouraged violence. You don't even know what you're talking about."

"I know I am about to make a comment on the problem that is going to make all the REAL racists to go nuclear.  Here it is:  The wage gap is the fault of the black men.  For these 4 reasons:  1) they pursue degrees that aren't worth as much  2)  They have a higher incarnation rate 3) they are 40 times more likely to commit a violent crime and 4) they have a sense of entitlement that isn't earned.      People would like to add ""discrimination"" but think about that.  Hasn't the criminal behavior and violent tendencies enough to make an employer shy?  So..... WWYD?  I never hesitated to hire anyone when I ran a business and didn't see any who worked for me behave poorly, very few blacks applied but they were accepted and worked well.  But the figure I used came from the DOJ.  Not my personal experience."

"And you would willingly put our nuclear arsenal in the hands of man with Trump's temperament?     I suppose if you go with the loud bark stops a fight, you could be right.

 I had a black friend from NYC who said you survived in the neighborhood in a couple of way.  You either acted like you were constantly in a mild rage, or you just acted so nuts that nobody was really sure what you might do.    Trump has too much fun to be in a rage, but he definately fits the unstable part.  ;-)"
"It appears that the Knights are repudiating their vows and forfeiting their claim to be a religious order, in favor of their identity as a medieval military order.  Fair enough.  The pope should acknowledge that they are not a religious order; he should dispense them from their vows, or clarify that the vows have no ecclesial significance; he should withdraw their patron and all clergy attached to the Knights; he should exclude the Knights from participating as religious in liturgical celebrations; and he should suspend or withdraw diplomatic recognition while the Holy See and the Knights work out whether or how they relate to each other going forward. It appears that the Knights are a cult, not within the church, but opposed to it. Perhaps Cardinal Burke will find himself more at home in that cult than in the church."
"As a born and bred New Orleanian, a Catholic, and a conservative, I have to say thank you to my co-Yats, Jake Berry and Mitch Landrieu.  Jake especially, living in the Carrollton section, knows what it's like to ride downtown on a streetcar and come to a rail-screeching, 270-degree crawl around Lee Circle before heading down Carondelet towards Canal.  Like me, he got to know and love Lee Circle, a landmark revered for its beauty since long before either of us was born.  Jake probably saw Lee Circle --- not just the statue of Lee that sat atop the tall, elegant pedestal, but the entire circle --- as one, integrated piece.  But Jake also knows that this piece of beauty was not just a sculpture, but to most black New Orleanians, a monument to military genius employed on the side of oppression, a symbol of defiance in the face of good.  To most black New Orleanians, his statue was reasonably seen as the equivalent of a statue of Hitler or Stalin.

"If this judge had made such awful comments and decisions based on prejudice and stereotypes regarding a Black or Jewish victim - he would be off the bench by now, and rightfully so. A defence of 'ignorance' and that he did not know it was wrong to operate on his prejudices (and in this case perceiving the victim as the accused) might on a human scale be a good thing for Mr. Camp, but does not qualify him to remain as a judge.To allow him to do so would be a mockery of justice and our judiciary."

So that's your excuse?  You can't find local people to do your dirty work?  I imagine that's what the while plantation owners said when they needed black slaves from Africa to work in their cotton fields too.
"I've had some very good relationships with black people in my life, through sports, the military, college, and business.  Most of them have assimilated very well, and live a quality middle class life.  They stayed in school, got a job, improved their skills, and didn't have kids out of wedlock or commit crimes.  It's that simple.  It's not about race.  It's about character.

But the Democrats' welfare programs gave them the wrong incentives.  In 1965, the #1 cause of poverty in the black community was single moms, which stood at 17% of births at the time.  So, the Democrats decided to reward being a single mom, and now it stands at 73% of births in the black community.  The system also penalizes them of they get married, or if a kid under 25 gets a job, and they wonder why the unemployment rate in the black community is so high.  The only way a kid can help the family with more money is thru crime; a paycheck reduces mom's benefits!"
"Although I do not have qualms about renaming Rhodes, I am not convinced it is a priority given what South Africa is going through. I would also suspect that if you chwck with black people in the same province or area you will find that black people long had an African name for that university, as it was with these towns supposedly renamed (Polokwane, Tshwane, Mangaung, Lephalale, Gauteng etc). Those names were there for more that 50 years. And why is nobody thinking of renaming Fort Hare and University of the North....are not these naes irrelevant or inappropriate for the new South Africa?"
"Leonard, your commentary seems to suggest that the American Government should be responsible to provide security for all of the Right Wing activist organizations like the Republican Party. Well that's all good and fine. So when the right wing intelligence operatives incite or encourage violence to shutdown liberal leaning events and rally's or demonstrations, and blacks and hippies begin marching for democracy and freedom, will they get the same protections, and reserved places in the parade, and access to the parks ?  Tell me, oh wise one, will they invite the people's choice into the castle. 

Not."
"Actually...blacks DID serve in the Confederate forces...true, mostly as militia units, starting in 1861.  Henry Louis Gates, of obama's ""the police acted stupidly""fame, spent three years searching for black union troops who fought at Gettysburg.  He found none.  The ONLY black known to have fought AT Gettysburg is one Charles F. Lutz, a private in Company F, 8th Regiment, Louisana Infantry (a Confederate unit.)  We DO know he lost an arm while attacking Cemetery Hill, and that he survived the war.  FREE blacks fought for the union as well, but not until after the EP, in 1863.  the EP, did NOT free the slaves in the northern states that still allowed slavery. (which is kind of ballsy of Lincoln, free slaves in another country, but not his own!  Secession did not violate the Constitution, and whatever the reason, states had that right. Lincoln wrote in strong favor of secession for Texas from Mexico!  States were STILL more important than the National government back then."
"Interesting point since not all slave owners in the US were big plantation owners, slaves were owned by anyone who had the price. No doubt to me that Mr. Metoyer at some point won his ""freedom"" formally as a black and this former slave, well, purchased slaves.

Slavery at the time was the custom until after the Civil War with no slaves, those enslaved once now how to be paid wages as freemen. Can history tell us Mr. Metoyer's ""back"" story? It is true that one does not think of slave ownerships by blacks. Many blacks were given papers of freedoms after masters died. So there were  ""free"" blacks"" in the slave states, which I think for the obvious reasons could be problematic to them. I don't know what your point is do you? My point is that slavery is a practice for humane reasons had to end no matter who owned the slaves."
"Let us pause for a moment and give thanks to our black citizens.  They do so much!

it's very rare for a black male to be involved in crime. Blacks have virtually no interactions with the police and court system, and are almost nonexistent in jails and prisons. This is because of the strong black family structure and black father figure. Black families place a high priority on education, and they love to read books about math and science. Black culture respects women and all authority figures. Blacks turn run-down neighborhoods into clean safe places to live. Blacks create many jobs and open successful small businesses via hard work ethics. Blacks are reliable employees. Blacks speak perfect English and rarely use profanity, and NEVER complain, nor point the finger at others and make excuses. We're talking very self-reliant people! Overall, black culture is so very positive and uplifting! We are so lucky to have black citizens.."
"Thank you for raising this issue Donald. Yes any item listed in ""Community Voices"" contains editorial content and reflects whatever biases the writer has. As to your other comments I have been around, having worked on these issues for twenty years and dealt with hundreds of sex workers, mostly street walkers. Black, Hispanic, and marginalized people, doing street based sex work, were a major component of the event discussed.  I also work closely with a variety of local outreach agencies with decades of first hand experience.  No one of these people would agree with your statement that the human trafficking problem is ""huge"". Tiny would be a better word. That does not mean it should be ignored.  However, laws passed to deal with it have been drawn broadly and in fact attack a long list of harmless people.  Sex workers support targeted laws that deal with abusers and not with others whose only crime is engaging in conduct someone considers immoral."
"The Louisiana problem is precisely the same as Alaska's.  The Koch brothers in particular got an incompetent governor elected and with redistricting, a similarly inept legislative majority. The Kochs even got judges elected to appeal courts. 

The did it the same way:  Hollering about ""abortion,"" ""homosexuals,""  ""regulations,"" and ""taxes,"" red meat issues that appealed to the lowest information voters.  

They even permanently exported a great deal of the state's black population post-Katrina, most of them to the Houston area.

They got what they paid for: Tax givebacks and progressively more insufficient oversight of industry and business.

Piyush Jindal tried to paper those problems over by selling state assets. Everything went on the block: Schools, bridges, prisons,roads, even the state capitol buildings.

The only reason they have a decent, competent governor now, is because Vitter couldn't stop  patronizing prostitutes and some of the fundamentalist right had a problem with that."

I think you're hung up on a false article of faith: that all humans are absolutely equal in all ways. Are all graphics equal? Is the cartoon ""Diamond Lil"" equal to Vermeer's ""Girl with a Pearl Earring""? Answer: only in the sense that they are all graphic works. Equal does not mean identical. Common sense demands recognition of the following:

<i>That that is, IS! That that is not, IS NOT! That that is, is NOT that that is not, and that that IS NOT, is not that that is.</i> PERIOD.

"First, the man needs to think about what that flag stood for when he fought under it in Afghanistan.  Those people never intended to harm the US.

Jim Crow, keeping black kids in legally segregated schools, sending more resources to affluent communities while poor communities suffer(why don't you study Puerto Rico, the result of our arrogant colonialism and the people who suffer the results.)

"Hobson's actual way is to tell the truth. RD goes in for distortion, then dismissal.

RD repeatedly sneers at what he calls ""Social Justice Warriors"". He says that they are wasting their time, and would do better to clean out their garages. RD said that the Mahatma Gandhi and Martin Luther King were just showing off when they went on hunger strikes to protest the way that Indian Untouchables (in Gandhi's case) and American Blacks (in King's case) were treated. He apparently has no difficulty with social injustice -- he certainly is against anyone protesting it.

RD has a vision of what path his spiritual growth should take. The problem is that he had decided that this is the proper path for everyone else as well. He insists that his priorities should be everyone else's priorities as well.

RD once was caught lying about something I had said. He refuses to retract the lie or apologize for it. He blames me for this refusal. He pretends to humilty and honesty, but practices neither one."
"Well if we are going back in time respectfully MULEMAN, lets not forget who was party of the Klan, wonderful folks like George Wallace and others.

Today it's much more refined, they enslave masses to their party using poverty and the generational cycle of welfare to keep the poor in chains and reliant totally on government. Look at the cities they have long controlled, Chicago, (who can forget the millions that Daley stashed away in safety deposit), Detroit since 1961 (notice they had to hand that city over to a republican manager during the recession it was so broke), etc.

"I have been critical of some of the BLM tactics....such as hijacking a Sanders' rally in Seattle early in the primary season.  However, the movement's quest for equality is commendable and, IMO, over-rides my concern with some of the ""in your face"" tactics which have been employed.  

There have been times when I, too, as a political activist have been what others have considered obnoxious.  Sometimes when officials and politicians continue to ignore your concerns, you have a choice:  give up or become a bit obnoxious.  

BLM has become a significant nationwide movement for the empowerment of the Black community and has my support.  

Quite likely without assertive, and, yes, obnoxious actions such as that Sanders' rally intrusion, the movement would not have been as successful in raising the profile of issues facing African Americans in our country.

Prosecutors cleared King, a 26-year-old elementary teacher, of a resisting arrest charge after viewing the video of the June 15, 2015 arrest. The 112-pound woman told the local newspaper she has hired lawyers as she considers a suit against the department. “I’ve become fearful to live my life,” King said. “I would rather stay home. I’ve become afraid of the people who are supposed to protect me and take care of me.”

"Choking a man to death on a street corner for selling cigarettes or shooting one in the back as he runs away isn't the result of ' unfortunate events'?  It also seems to me the problem is trying to put all these different killings/murders under one broad umbrella explanation.  They ought to be understood in their immediate and broader context, a context with multiple dimensions.  It doesnt help when the lawyer representing her family, who has also represented the families of other victims such as Castille (shot to death in his car with the baby in the back seat, after telling the cop he had a gun in the car, had a permit to carry, etc.) says she is the most innocent victim ever.  Why?  How many women of colour have called police only to end of death at their hands?  His comment to me shows how deep-seated and often unconscious racial prejudice is, let's not pretend its not a major contextual factor in police interactions...it is not however always the only one."
"I had a more comprehensive reply, but it was censored.

Anyway, see the Financial Time's headline today:

The point here is that radical Islamists like Khuram need to be dealt with before they commit atrocities.

Khan's strategy is to deal with terrorists after they have committed atrocities.

If Khan had advocated an effective strategy for dealing with terrorists like Khuram, then the latest tragedy might have been prevented.

Khan's failed policy of complacency and lack of prevention is unacceptable.

Since this post is criticizing a globalist like Khan, perhaps the censors will eliminate it as well.

"I'll say again, I think people are responsible for their own actions. I think we agree on that. I am not in a million years looking to excuse the shootings.

That being said, it seems a bit off, to make a study of the moral failings of a group that has been systematically debased and disadvantaged and exploited, from their arrival to the present, and not to take serious stock of the grievous moral failures that have been done to them. It sometimes seems that every time one mentions some crime done to Black people, the response offered is that they deserve it, in a sense, that they incurred the harm as a result of their own deficiencies. Predatory lending is only an issue because they lack good sense. The schools would be fine, if the students new how to act right. Families would be strong, if the parents were proper parents. There wouldn't be issues with policing, if they weren't so very criminal and dangerous. There's a general failure to take personal responsibility.

"For a moment lets just look at what we know so far. Congresswoman Wilson, a Democrat from the district the young man grew up in that tragically lost his life, claim:
(1)  she recalls  overhearing Mr Trump more than once say ""I am sure he must have known what he signed up for""; 
(2) she admits not hearing the whole phone call;
(3) she has not recalled anything else publicly that she remembers from the phone call;

Subsequently she has gone on to claim this is ""Trump's Benghazi"" and the phone call a ""cover-up"" for mismanagement in Niger. 

Trump for his part has denied the recollection and claimed that she is misrepresenting the conversation. 

Sounds like classic politicking; but really in a week with some pretty significant Trump administration developments this is what BS/DM give us?

I think this mostly speaks for itself, especially to jump on this so quickly. The motivation here is confirmation bias and unfortunately why the DM US reporting is so poor and irrelevant."

"Do you not understand that if you think it's okay to discriminate then there is nothing stopping an entire city from denying services to gays, Christians, or any other group the ""in crowd"" doesn't feel morally obligated to serve? We have laws that you cannot discriminate based on race. It's kind of absurd you think we should be allowed to discriminate based on sexual orientation or how much ""in sin"" someone is or is not. That is not freedom.

All anyone is asking the baker to do is make cakes for the general public. If he doesn't like the fact that some members of the public are gay then he shouldn't make cakes. Nobody is knocking on his door forcing him to make offensive cakes. The only offense in this entire situation is his opinion of the customer. As you stated, the customers were offered other services - they were good customers he had no issue with. He decided ""I cannot serve you because of who you are"" and that is the problem. It's no different than ""we don't serve blacks here""."
"Another Dylann Roof, just a different color.
Not a hate crime of course because he's Black.."
"tRump created the anti-tRump rallies, March.  Every time he opens his clap-trap he manages to create a new ant-tRump faction.  Glen Beck interviewed a guest that strongly suggested that tRump needs to be assassinated to make room for another rise of Ted Cruz candidacy; and Beck agreed.  How do you like those apples?  It's not just the Mexicans, Hispanics, Latinos, and blacks that are anti-tRump it's a growing population that'll have their say in the voting booths; if tRump manages to make it to the RNC."
"""It seems now that if a black is shot and killed by police it brings immediate protesting and usually some level of rioting""

I think you're confusing news coverage with reality. About 200 blacks have been killed by police so far in 2016. There haven't been 200 protests or rioting."
"Well said about Sir John, surely the greatest and certainly the most essential prime minister this country ever had.

I think it is close to treason that the hyper-partisan Liberals are removing MacDonald from the $10 bill in 2018 to substitute a black woman from Nova Scotia whose sole claim to fame is that she once refused to sit in the upper balcony of a theatre which banned blacks from sitting on the first level and spent overnight in jail and paid a $25 fine (in 1946).

This woman was wrongly treated and a case can be made that she is the Canadian version of Rosa Parks and she deserves to be appropriately honoured.  

But to remove the father of our country rather than another PM on some other bill because he was a Conservative and this ties in with Junior`s design to con low information voters that Canada did not really begin until his old man took power in 1968 is simply beyond the pale.

Name some grand theatre after her or take another PM off the currency but SAVE SIR JOHN!"
"Don't know how you made the assumption that I think racism does not exist. It does, and it is not going to be lessened by the university building a hide-away for black students."
"I should have known your complaint would boil down to guns and liberals.
So, the Denver Post engaged in a diabolical scheme to use poor, oppressed Sen. Marble's fried chicken remark to distract from the nefarious gun bills.
Sen. Markle was talking about the nutrition habits of poor black people ... and then talked about fried chicken.
But, rather than question Sen. Marble's common sense, you'd rather blame gun control and liberals.
No conservative has ever put their foot in their mouth, eh?"
"In his book ""Losing the Race: Self-Sabotage in Black America"", the linguist John McWhorter, who is black (in case it matters), tells the story of David Howard, a city worker in Washington, D.C., who lost his job because he used the word ""niggardly"". To state the obvious, race is a very sensitive issue among people."
Black lives matter is not a hate group.
"I admit, I could be wrong, he may not have been an immigrant. In my city, there are a large number of Hispanic immigrants. They dress similar and groom similar and drive similar dilapidated vehicles. They gather at home depot parking lots waiting for job opportunities. If you think I am a racist by such statements you are wrong - it is simply an observation.

(I very much admire people who work hard in spite of tough living conditions)

Many here, have had a knee-jerk PC reaction and have already labeled me a hateful racist! Ha!

That would explain why most of my friends, since kindergarten where either black or Hispanic!!

 In pointing out my possible error in judgment - they have all judged me in error - with much animosity and condescension I might add, - which I never intended for the possible 'immigrant' driver who sped past the school children getting off the bus.

In JUDGING ME - you miss my original point - the importance of knowing the language and laws of the place you live."
"And just like that, the last semblance of an Obama ""legacy"" is fading quickly into the night.  In ten years, he'll be a vague and distant, mostly forgotten, memory, of a time when Americans were so bent on proving they weren't racist that they elected some random black guy who gave good speeches and had ZERO executive and leadership experience, and then that black guy accomplished basically nothing except prompting those same Americans to be so angry they elected a reality TV star next."
"Straight and Narrow, do you feel the same way about Alcohol?  Are all alcohol consumers, dirty drunks? Your myth about it being stronger is way off btw... Have you ever heard of hash? You know a very high concentrate abstract of cannabis? You know the one that's been around in human use for over 2000 years.. You may not be aware of this, but cannabis based cough syrup with THC concentrations of 60 to 80% use to be very very common prior to 1946. Your great grandparents, maybe even grandparents, had very likely used these cough syrups OTC prior to cough syrup making the switch to codeine. See your government lied to you, initially telling you only Mexicans, blacks, and entertainers used marijuana. They also told you that marijuana wasn't cannabis. Repeating the false propaganda of Ignorance, does not make you an expert by any means. It's exactly the same as what your parents could have been smoking in the 60's."
"IMO, the wearing of blackface does not ipso facto constitute ""mocking"" black persons.  I think intent is important...We've just seen this with the furor over the actions of Ms. Shurtz.

However, in today's very divisive climate, the action of wearing of ""blackface"" is likely to cause problems for everyone involved as it will be far more likely seen as a ""mocking"" action than an ""honoring"" action.  Unfortunately, it is also far more likely that it will be a ""mocking"" behavior rather than an ""honoring"" behavior.  I think Ms Shurtz's case is clearly the exception....."
"So games like grand theft auto, call of duty and the others in the genre or tv shows like the plethora or CSI's or dexter or sons of anarchy, or movies like sawI, II, III, hostel, gamer, and many others with a death count in the hundreds didn't have ANYTHING to do with the lawlessness and disregard for public safety or authority over the last 25 years????!!! It was those darn black people and rap music you say??!!. Yeah ok 😂"
"You are right.

I cringe every time I speak with Indians and their use of racial slurs. Caste System is based on race, lighter skins higher castes, and dark skin lower castes. Caste or ""varna"" in Sanskrit means skin colour.

The Indians think they are more beautiful thus superior to East Asians who they call ""chapta"" or ""flats"" because of their not so deep faces.  No other neighbour - not Russia, not Pakistan, not Iran think of Chinese as ugly or inferior. The Chinese are well liked and respected in all Asia except India. 

This Indian arrogance will not serve them well. They were defeated once because  of underestimating their foes, and this will happen again. Racial superiority never works."
"So in our Land of the Free, you want people forced to stand for the pledge and flag? Hmmmm. We are not equal, anyone who bashes the LGBT community is NOT a believer in equal rights. Equality for everyone, regardless of color, race or sexuality but nope, we preach hate and ban people from the bathroom they use based on their birth ""private parts"" - note PRIVATE parts - and not who they love their life as. Equality? Bullshit. Blacks. Women. LGBT. And now you want to punish the NFL financially because you disagree with one player. Wow. We have so hatred and disdain for anyone who disagrees with our beliefs. That doesn't seem like we value ALL people to me. Why don't you protest against companies that knowing hire sexual predators and suspected rapists? Refuse to watch swimming because of the Brock the Rapist? But nope, that's ok because Brock stands for the flag and Colin Kaepernick  doesn't. Good to see your values are in the right place."

"Using that logic, if banning women (or even blacks or gays) from serving as combat troops was ""good enough"" for the first several hundred years the United States existed, then it should be fine if we return to that status.  Dont you think?

I mean, it was only a couple of years ago that women were even granted the ability to even apply for all types of combat positions...but, since it worked out so well beforehand with them not being allowed to apply for those positions, might as well go back to that also.  Right?"
Solve the problem. Identify the gaps in the ACA and fix them. Reality check to Republicans: we had a black president. Get used to it.

I can't remember the last time I watched, listened or even noticed the national anthem at a sporting event. I turn the game on TV at the minute it kicks off, or I'm in the kitchen getting snacks, or I'm in line still coming into the stadium.

If someone is holding a gun to your head during the national anthem in your own home, that's on you.

The complainers are essentially telling black men: ""Shut up, be grateful for what you have, and stay in line."""
"Key to BIG LIE is the misuse of the word ""disproportionately""
proper comparison is not to % of population but % of criminal behavior/felony arrests. 
    The authors of course know this but their purpose is to deceive and not report. 

""And police have continued to shoot and kill a disproportionately large number of black males, who account for nearly a quarter of the deaths, yet are only 6 percent of the nation’s population."""
"Time will tell whether the black players protests further reduces the NFL income sufficiently for management to fire them.  It doesn't appear that anyone in the NFL is taking Trump's advice and firing the kneelers,  nor even threatening to fire them.  Professional Football seems to be following the pattern set by Academia.  Not working out well for Missouri U or Evergreen State College."
"Here we go again, a black man?  Sound racists to me, they should say a dark man then we can clump more people together and not hear the race card over and over again.  How do these people get guns anyway.  Main thing they only hurt each other and no innocent bystander."
Trump had no idea who the CBC was until last week when he tried to get a black reporter who questioned him about the CBC to set up the meeting like she was somehow connected to the Congressional Black Caucus.
"Better to simply treat them as the temporary installations that they are. 

Motague himself was ready to paint over the Brown mural. The attachment to these paintings is feigned. By Montague for wanting to keep ""his"" space, and by the black community for yet another opportunity to play the victim.

But hey, you guys keep threatening lawsuits and see who lets you paint anything else. The entire mural scene will be reduced to a handful of professional painters, none of whom will be painting questionable political stuff."
Isn't it time you liberal democrats admit that so-called free contraception is all about reducing the number black and brown babies born.  It's not about a woman's right to choose.  It's not about reproductive rights or discrimination.  It's about eugenics and it's been the holy grail of the progressive movement since the 1920's.  A simple Google search of Margaret Sanger will tell you all you need to know.
"""Trump became president because of his vision to ""Make America Great Again"" ""
Yes Ruben, and President Trump is well on his way to do it.  GDP hit 3.0 last quarter, Obama never came close to that.  The Stock Market is at an all time high! 
Unemployment is lower. As far as the ""racist"" claim goes, Black employment is way up under Trump. Inflation has stayed low. Foreign countries may not like him, but they do respect him, because they know he will do as he says.  Unlike the previous ""red liner"" guy."
Black nationalists loved Obama in 2008. Where were you then?
"How perfect that Ohio Dan and Moosecowski have found a long awaited fabricated excuse to dump Trump. Now they spring, just before the election. Sullivan (a lawyer) knows that Pence can not be president. The people have picked Trump. Lisa voted for the bank bailout and she is the one that they coined the acronym RINO after. Both Sullivan and Lisa are part of the anti American globalist agenda. Sullivan was backed by outside money and ran for Senate here because it was cheaper than Ohio.Both are RINOs and corporatists bought and paid for by globalists. Now they reveal their true motives and can support by default the criminal Clinton while pretending to be politically correct. It is disingenuous and they are liars. Trump represents change from a globalist agenda to an America First agenda. This is what is feared by those in control as they see their power slipping. Stand by Trump and take back our country. VOTE TRUMP!"
"What about forgiveness. Can someone out there say they have never ever done something stupid?

Forgiveness!

I for one am very offended by all this but can find in my heart to forgive her.

Would you?"
"The third though is the clearest indicator of just how Orwellian and messed up universities are today. At one f the rallies for free speech Peterson held, a young black man was at the mc speaking his mind when a disturbance drew a camera operators attention and they turned their camera around just in time to catch a prominent BLC member and student of U of T in the act of hurling a racial slur at the guy speaking on the mic. A clear and blatant human rights violation has been perpetrated against this guy yet the student who committed this act of violence against that poor guy is still a student here and faces absolutely no discipline whatsoever for egregious act of violence against that man. The level of academic discourse is an absolute disgrace an the places are being run by fanatical hypocrites."
"Oh Andrew Its you phony conservatives who have no clue.  Andrew do you think today's republican party believes in freedom for  blacks?  Why?  Today's republicans tend to be racist thugs.

"I caught your sarcasm.  Crime may have come down by a significant percentage, but when I look at a Detroit or Baltimore police blotter today, Neil's line ""What is the color when black is burned?"" comes to mind.  Crime is still pretty bad in many places."
"""Interesting comment. Do you have any stats showing how may black men were shot by police as well as stats of how many black males were shot by other black males?"" 

That comparison is absolutely irrelevant.  However if you do wish to continue your line of reasoning. What would be the outcome if we found that black males killing each other was 100 x greater than that of police killings. The actions of the former are crimes and so those police killings are crimes as well.
The police have had too may cases where they used deadly force inappropriately. It needs to stop"
"So do you also think abolition of slavery was a failure because so many black Americans still toil in multiple part-time jobs to put food on the table while only a small number are corporate lawyers?

I'm saying it's a silly way to measure the intrinsic value of human rights or the movements that won them.

He11 yes, women are doing better because of feminism.  Over the previous century, women went from being the obedient property of their father/husband to being persons with rights and the freedom to make their own decisions.  That's a huge improvement for all women."
"Freddie Gray?  Rough treatment?  ALL the officers were found NOT GUILTY,  even though the mayor of Baltimore, a black woman, criticized the police, called them guilty, allowed other blacks to burn and loot, she said, 'we have given them a place for their activities'  That Freddie Gray?  Get tough on crime Mr. President!"
"The problem is we won't know if they are real cops marching or pretend cops, like that guy in the Village People. I guess you didn't think about that, did you?

"""Eugenics"" ? "" Racists"" ""Sexism""  Then we in Oregon must especially denigrate Margaret Sanger,  the founder of Planned Parenthood, for her part in founding Oregon's State Hospital-run Oregon State Board of Eugenics requiring forced sterilization of thousands of women and who, along with W.E.B. DuBois proposed the Negro Project to sterilize young black girls to reduce negro poverty.

""Margaret Sanger aligned herself with the eugenicists whose ideology prevailed in the early 20th century. Eugenicists strongly espoused racial supremacy and “purity,” particularly of the “Aryan” race. Eugenicists hoped to purify the bloodlines and improve the race by encouraging the “fit” to reproduce and the “unfit” to restrict their reproduction. They sought to contain the “inferior” races through segregation, sterilization, birth control and abortion.""

"Police officers have led to the murders of blacks, so now where are we? Well, I'll tell you.

"An honest question- what do you mean by overseers? I have always felt that Democrats have taken that role for the black community. And what is an ""appealing platform"" that is any different for blacks than for the rest of the country? I don't know what tax cuts are planned for ""the rich"" right now but the Bush tax cuts helped my small business and were tax cuts for ALL earners. Sure, the rich got cuts but they also got increases in capital gains and dividends. The middle class saw more of their paychecks. That is why Dems allowed them to be extended. Of course, he also spent too much and added to the deficit but we can't just tax that away by punishing success rather than creating value, not just reallocating resources."

Between that and the current illegal immigrant catastrophe overwhelming the Canadian government and its posters, and jumping through hoops to make your statue less awful than the American statue and therefore OK to honor, it's impossible to take any of this seriously.

The news was, of course, worse for minorities and women. The rate of poverty among blacks and Hispanics was well over 20 percent. Women, too, remained more likely to struggle to make ends meet, especially elderly women, whose poverty rate was nearly double that of men in the 75 and older age group. And though more women than ever are participating in the workforce, with 61 percent of women employed full time in 2014, their earnings remained about 79 percent of their male colleagues.

"I agree with zuglo - a societal consensus - in a democracy - is reached as to what should be memorialized and what should not and happens on a specific basis. What is acceptable or not can shift over time as it has with the symbols of Confederacy. If American race relations are to be improved - and they desperately need to be - the place of these symbols, so offensive to a large part of the population in the South (and not just black Americans), have to be re-thought.  This also happens in the other direction, too, as forgotten or previously unrecognized individuals are lauded long after their deeds. 

As I said in a response to another poster below, this shift IS history and not a ""rewriting"" of it. History is not an immovable iceberg written only once."
"There are many more women in our society who deserve praise other than Hillary.

"In six years living in a stable historic black neighborhood in Philadelphia, a neighborhood going back to free black people in the 1830's (my rental two-story brick row house was three blocks from the house where the opera star Marian Anderson grew up) there were two active criminal youth gangs nearby, but on my block there was a solid neighborhood committed to resistance to crime. The kids on my block talked to me and told me everything about who was doing what. Most of the folks stayed out of crime and drugs; the men mostly worked, and a lot of the women. There were a lot of retirees, they all knew me by name, and they greeted me daily. There was crime, but more than in Eugene/Springfield? I don't think so.

In other poor neighborhoods there was considerable crime, without regard to skin color. The correlating factor was poverty. Of course, the very big crime dollars are stolen in the corporate sector."

Do you know the history of your country?  What black man was twice elected president by the supposed ""racist"" majority in this country?  What percentage of NFL players are black or people of color?  Finally, I'm not lecturing these players on patriotism, which is their own business.  I'm challenging them to declare themselves: do they agree with Kaepernick's stated reason for disrespecting the flag, or not?  The fans who are paying their salaries deserve an answer."

"Long gone are the days (about 10 years removed) of the Alaska that voted like Idaho (Trump +32), Wyoming (Trump +46), and Nebraska (Trump +26). Alaska will continue to trend away from the Republicans, though Alaska will likely continue to command a 10-15% Republican advantage in Presidential elections for the next dozen years or so.

It's just a matter of how quickly oil-worker parents and their children who arrived in the 1960s and 70s are replaced in the electorate by millennials and religiously unaffiliated voters . Finally, in about ten years from now, AK will become a minority-majority state (Alaska Native/Black/Hispanic/Pacific Islander majority)."
"I suspect the upheaval resulting from the black face episode is really a reaction to the biases of the outraged surfacing. Recent studies indicate that bias is a human trait; a remnant of early survival mechanisms. I know I have biases and prejudices. I recognize their patterns when they arise. Consequently, and in most cases, I'm able to set them aside so that I can deal with people who are different from me in the ""here and now"", between ""me and the person in my presence"", and not respond from a past  incident in the ""there and then"", with persons who are not present. Prejudice will always be a problem as long as our prejudices and biases remain hidden. It is from their dark, mental dens that they hold sway over how we interact with people who are different from us in the present.
Question: Have any persons of color, particularly blacks, responded to this event? If so, what have they said?"
"Ms. Clinton is underappreciated.
Because of her, a black man and a political outsider were able to be elected as Presidents of the United States.
If the Republicans run a woman against her in the next election, another ceiling will be shattered."
"Bigotry is not a Christian virtue. I keep saying that your claim to be a Christian is a sham, and you keep giving me evidence that I'm right to say it.

Yes, I'm sure that when businesses were told they had to serve blacks, you screamed in indignation. Many of those racists claimed that their racism was based on their religious beliefs. You display EXACTLY the same mindset.

And clearly you have borne a grudge for many years (something that you claim is wrong to do) because you once experienced a minor piece of racism at the hands of some blacks. Now, I agree that they were wrong to treat you as they did, but it should have made you consider the evils of racism. Apparently, itonly made you resentful -- an attitude you also say is wrong."
"It turns out that the US military, and the National Guard, paid millions to the NFL to start the colour guard and honouring military heroes events."
"Given that virtually all ideas in Ottawa have already been test driven in Ontario with disastrous effect, presumably a glance at the partisan sinecure and carefully constructed black hole that is Infrastructure Ontario will shed some light on the types of  problems any sane and sensible fund manager would be wary of when the Prime Minister presents Gerald Butt's sticky fingers in the shape of a national infrastructure bank.."
"The Black Lives Matter movement is not to stir up hatred.    It is in response to injustice they experience living in our United States.  The reason the media focused on the remarks by the President was because we were shocked by his lack of clarity about the events in Charlottesville.    By saying twice ""by many sides"", he implies that nobody in particular was at fault.  Oh yeah, a liberal protester here, and a neo nazi there.....all the same.    No it was not."
"Sorry, but I don't believe you. First, you contradict yourself throughout the story. Second, the word - miscegenation - wasn't in anyone's lexicon back then, with your grandmother. You inserted that word for your own emphasis. 
Lastly, you never researched history. Lee never owned slaves. He was a Union officer who switched solely for the purpose of defending Virginia, which at the time had 60,000 free blacks, the highest amount of any state. 
I see you worked for Hillary. Figures..."
"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States.
.
His latest refusal to stand for the anthem -- he has done this in at least one other preseason game -- came before the 49ers' preseason loss to Green Bay at Levi's Stadium on Friday night.
.
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""

"if that isn't the pot calling the kettle black.... back at spreading more shibai and false news localguy? by your *own* definition YOU are a rookie poster! where is your credible reference of what a mark of a rookie poster is? how about if credible reference links aren't supplied then you are spreading false news? where's your link to that? what lunacy.

here let's try this one on: ""david ige is the governor of hawaii.""

that's cholo's claim. cholo isn't supplying you with credible reference links so it must be false news (obviously not)? that's your pathetically weak argument? 

as you can see... what ridiculous logic.

a reference link can help validate a statement or fact. but the lack thereof does not necessarily mean it is false news. it could be true *or* false regardless. it's up to you whether you choose to believe it or not at face value or commit on investigating further into the issue."
"Yes, a nice simple solution.  However, why should the academic community have to accommodate bigotry?

Would we have said the same sort of thing in the 1950s when too many hotels and conference facilities would bar Jews, Blacks, etc? Would our answer have been that if a conference wanted to include such people then they bloody well should hunt around for some facility that would accommodate them and, meanwhile, stop complaining?"
I would also like to see  many more qualified African Americans on city council.  Maybe we'll all hear more about Sharon Maxwell that will generate some money for her election to city council?
"As a child of the sixties we fought for civil rights and equality. We had come out of WWII and Korea with the American blacks fighting our wars, relegated to second class citizenry, and came out of slavery to become as a permanent economic underclass. Affirmative action at that time was to give the black population a jump start to economic  equality.  None of us  could have imagined at that time how institutionalized an abused the program would become. I never though that some kid whose parents might have been born in Jamaica in 1972 could be the beneficiary of a program that was targeted to children of Americans who participated in our history and did not enjoy the full benefits of our society.  Sorry to say, I question how our previous President benefited when one of his parents wasn't American, was born to no one who was discriminated against in the  U.S. and benefitted from a program  not  designed as a y'alll come. I would like to keep affirmative action for those it was intended."
"Thank you, that clarifies a bit.  In that context elitism is like bigotry and racism, in that a label relieves us of any further thought.  I've met people who will say ""Well, you know how 'they' (liberals, conservatives, Latinos, Blacks......) are"".  I guess accusing someone of 'elitism' is one of those things like conservative or liberal, often misidentified.   What you took as condescension from David Muir may have been only his disbelief that so many people believed Trump's line."
I didn't see where it said anything about the color of his clothing.
"Lets say that there is increased vetting. And lets say that vetting process involves in depth questioning of ALL prospective immigrants.

Now lets also say that the Immigration officer is taught to specifically look for signs that perhaps the prospective immigrant sitting in front of her or him may not have been exactly truthful when responding to written questions, on, for example, gender equality. Perhaps a hint would the prospective immigrant's wife covered in a head to toe black veil. 

Now that could be the woman's choice, so the immigration officer probes a little further. Maybe asks the woman some questions, and checks the man's reaction.

Does this sound invasive? So what?

We either want to retain and build on the liberties and freedoms we have, including by bringing in those who share that aspiration, or we watch it erode as we continue to let any and all in."
Which is precisely why Kim wants the ability to bite back.
"Just curious, would you repeat this post if it were a BLM issue?"
"So what? The issue was racism against African Americans, remember?"
"Johnny Cash Family Tells Nazis: Don't Wear 'Man In Black' T-Shirts
A message from the children of Johnny Cash:
We were alerted to a video of a young man in Charlottesville, a self-proclaimed neo-Nazi, spewing hatred and bile.
He was wearing a t-shirt emblazoned with the name of Johnny Cash, our father.
We were sickened by the association."
"Why do Canadian Federal Governments think that Canadian taxpayer monies aren't for the betterment of Canadians.  I abhor the fact that taxpayer money can be freely tossed around on anyone but Canadians, without so much as a ""do you mind if we take your hard-earned money and give it away?"" Look around, J. Trudeau, our country is falling apart...not because people don't work hard enough, but because our government works even harder to take more money out of our pocket and give it away to foreign countries.  Why are the Canadian people putting up with this robbery?  You were only voted in because we saw no other option.  Better keep your bags packed because Canadians are fed up with this scene.  You promised CHANGE and SUNNY WAYS but what we are seeing from you are the same inside games that the CONS gave us for a decade."

"Thank you for the clarification.  Indeed ""we ""are the state and no individual is the state (at least for now).

"Excuse me, but the Republican party did not disappear over the last 50 years.  They ran against Democrats in all those races.    You blame the Republican failure to connect to urban black neighborhoods on the Democrats?   

Republicans lost, they lost miserably, they offered no policy, no example of how they could fix urban blight.  The only person I  heard address urban poverty in a meaningful was Sen. Jack Kemp and he never got a serious look by the party insiders.

I'm past sick of listening to the blame game.  We have One US Congress, One Executive Branch, One Supreme Court.     Like it or not The Parties are interwoven.  They are failing the nation because of their inability to overcome their self interest."
"Well, BLM says the herds there in Oregon are too large for the area they populate, this reversal on the ban will allow culling there in Oregon as well as anywhere else that is over populated.  Like it or not it must be done in order to maintain healthy herds.  IFG has been doing this with wild game herds here in Idaho for over 50 years and we have some of the healthiest wild game in the nation.  I would think we would see the same type of results with the horses."
"It's a tax grab.  Ontario and Quebec opted for a black box cap & trade system, and Alberta will use the carbon tax to fund pet projects.  Only BC has a revenue neutral tax so far, but Clark has (wisely) been reluctant to raise it, as it is very regressive and revenue redistribution will could start to get contentious."
"Wow. Quoting Black as example of - well, anything . Things must be bad for you, mh."
"I agree one hundred perecnt, but i would limit those trade relationships to countries that embrace the same values we do:

1.  Valuing human rights
2.  Concern for the environment
3.  Access to medicine
4.  Access to affordable post secondary
5.  A social safety net

I love we now have a better agreement with Europe and would hope the government continues building trade agreements with South American, African, and Asian countries that fit that requirement.

Unfortunately i dont agree that China is a solution until they commit to human rights reform, environmental protection, and hold their companies accountable to North American/European standards with respect to food and product safety.

I would take  America with their flaws over the Chinese all day long."
"HEllO.   I have been here for 40 years, no breaks .  I am disabled now.  So what I am hearing you say is I should not get my PFD Because my health is in the toilet?  I would love to work and use my AAS IN HUMAN SERVICES but know I would not last due to health.  

I depend on the PFD to  stock up on food, pay home insurance, car insurance an make sure my car is safe.  I live on less then 1K a month .

 Taking 1/2 the PFD left me with lack of heat this year.  I have to make sure my old 96 car is safe.  It could be YOUR family I hit and kill if I dont.  

My PFD takes care of all the things I cant throughout the year.  


I do good things with my Pfd.  No vacations ,  fun times,  trying to survive and praying for my health to return.

As I see it.  We were in the black till Parnell gave all the Alaskan money to the oil companies.  Bet he has a nice desk job now.  He should be held accountable.  Any lawyers have an opinion on this?  Gov. used their portion, now they want the rest."
"Sure, I think that kind of two-faced employer attitude could happen to anyone - but surely the person involved should be able to grouse about it without being labelled 'sanctimonious'.  Especially since a junior associate who plays high level hockey is a lot more likely to be accommodated.

Yes, I think her reference to Nina Simone was based on the fact that she's also black and a civil rights activist, so that singing along with her and talking about inequality was less likely to be a shared-favourite with other firm stalwarts than humming Bob Dylan and talking about summer vacations.  Nothing more nor less than a critique of the narrowness of the ""fit"" criterion of making it in a big firm.  I don't think she was saying ""all blacks are alike."""
"Armed, Black males according to an earlier release on nixle. I noticed ADN didn't print that part. Trail watch might need to be extended to downtown and UMED district."

"Hopefully it won't get as bad as 2010, but since this series (and probably the top wildcard position) is already lost, the real test for me will be how they do against the Giants and whether or not Black has the guts to give McMahon a start or move Blackmon down into the four or five hole. Black can say whatever he wants--he's trying to stick up for his guys--but it is obvious this team has been gripping and choking for a while."
"Brilliant Canadian expat Malcolm Gladwell surmised the election of President Obama gave American racists the excuse to voice their thoughts like they hadn't done in decades.  ""Racism is dead cause we have a black president, so...""

"Kapernick's problem is that he - like the BLM racist crowd he fell into - conclude ""police brutality"" without bothering to wait for the facts of the case to emerge before making a decision as to what happened.

BLM was founded on the Michael Brown ""hands up don't shoot"" lie and in spite of that Wilson was totally vindicated and the originator of the ""hands up don't shoot"" lie - Dorian Johnson - not only recanted that false claim under FBI scrutiny, but already had a previous conviction of providing false information to police, these cop-hating racists ran with it anyway and presumed Wilson to be guilty before and even AFTER proven otherwise.

These people are not interested in facts; they are interested in attacking police and racially rabble-rousing. Furthermore, until recently, ""peaceful"" BLM was allied with the violent Marxist organization Antifa which has physically attacked police.

I'm sure BLM is still getting funding by Soros, since such people are right up his alley."
"Farley Mowat has been dead for three years, so it's hard for him to write front-page columns.

You do not cite one example and neither does Shea -- he just blabbers on about guilt by association.  It seems that not one fact in LifeSite has been proven to be false.

    Rwandans after the terrible genocide in their country in the 1990s?

Just a little light joy riding and atic hopping no big deal. What is all the fuss about. We are living in a cesspool.
"So Ryerson thought  a particular way in his time.  I agree that it is so important to understand the time and why he and others thought the way they did.  The good he and others did in our history should be examined as rigorously as the mistakes and problems encountered over the actions and thinking of the time.  Yes, Ryerson thought of a seperate school system for a group of people.  We see remnants of those thoughts in Ontario today so does the idea in general work?  After all, Ryerson did not set up or operate the residential schools.   More recently, all Ontario governments have maintained  and supported the Catholic separate school system and also advocated for and implemented separate black-centric schools."
Were you wearing your super cool black mask when you wrote that?

"The UN just released a report condemning Canada for anti-African racisim so ingrained in Canadian society that it's considered 'normal' and not even noticed by the majority. They call for apologies, reparations and memorials.
It permeates every Canadian institution and found a direct link between a history of anti-black racism and the deplorable conditions that blacks in Canada find themselves in today with everything from an over representation in police homicides to poverty to inadequate food to poor education opportunities."
"I have never encouraged or accepted the idea that police should be killing unarmed people.  Yes, some cops, over the years have worked with the Klan.   That is not the case with ALL police.   I think you are doing a disservice to many police forces.   Does it help encourage the police forces to protect and serve black Americans to greet them with hate?   That is what I am suggesting when I say the viscous circle must be broken.   You are not going to encouraging the cops to be on your side if you greet them with a raised fist.  I also say the same thing to the cops."

"It's true, if the ACA is ""repealed and replaced"" - and that's still up in the air, I think - neither I nor anyone in the media nor anyone I have spoken to has a clue about what would replace it. I have read several columnists who say the repeal would be harder than most people seem to think. And indeed, if repealed entirely but not replaced with something at least as good, up to twenty million insured would immediately lose their health coverage. People are worried, especially those with ACA plans who have expensive pre-existing conditions. A lot of blacks and Muslims worry about a new wave of persecution. And there is much more that's up in the air. Millions of women marching against Trump do so because of the general disrespect he showed them. The Mexican peso is tanking because of worry about Trump yanking a lot of jobs out of Mexico, and charging Mexico for a 60 billion dollar wall, while returning 11 million unemployed Mexicans. People worry with good cause."
"If we want a more civil country, we must decide that all lives matter. I'm not sure that a majority of Americans believe that all lives matter. As a nation, we have never acted like all lives matter. The country has been built on violence both here and abroad. There was no golden age when civility for everyone ruled. Since I'm black, I can testify that civility has never been available to everyone in this country. Remember how Obama was treated. He experienced 8 years of incivility directed at him. So we elected the leader of the birther movement. There was nothing civil about that chain of events. If your only tool is a hammer, all your problems look like nails. The one tool everyone has easy access to is a gun. I don't think that is making us more civil. At the very least, we need more tools in our tool boxes."
"Using that reasoning only black people are entitled to free speech, and civil disobedience.  That's literally a minority opinion - on the Supreme Court, and in the public at large.  But everyone is entitled to their opinion in my opinion - but maybe not in your opinion."
"Time to use those empty rooms at the university and put the legislators up there and pay any per diem lodging to the university.  They can eat there by buying a meal ticket, just like students do.  Then the legislative ""lounge"" can be bid out to operate in the black, jack."
"Jaxi, you are 100% correct.  ""I'm sorry you feel that way"" is usually meant as a put down, as if there's something wrong with the person who feels this way; it's often meant as a rejection of responsibility for having damaged someone. 
An actual empathetic response might have been something like ""I can imagine it must be pretty stressful to feel people are watching you all the time.""
And actually, as anyone who is black or hangs out with black friends around here  knows, they are likely to get stared at from time to time.  Sometimes with hostility, but not nearly as bad as I remember from the '50s; more from idle curiosity  than hostility and sometimes even with genuine friendliness .  At least that's my impression and I could be wrong. 
 As our community becomes more diverse people of color will not seem so ""unusual"" around here.  And I hope the nation's current tension over race relations does not pull our community back to our less openminded past."
"All media coverage of these groups should be banned or strictly limited. That way they will not have an audience.

Groups like these thrive on attention. Cut that off and they will whither.

The same goes for far left groups and other nut bar fringes like Black Lives Matter. These groups get far too much attention. That attention leads to more violence."
"Many of the men and women in blue are doing their darnedest to keep the public safe, but those few who are doing terrible things and getting  caught put a black eye on whole force. Now with Kealoha, being at the top of the force, getting booked for a crime makes the whole Hawaii blue force in a bad situation....now people will be asking who else will get caught in this saga."
An innocent black bear shot by police for a crime he didn't commit.  Black Bear Lives Matter!
"This is rich.  Patriotism and respect for our veterans wasn't much of an issue when deferments Trump and his cultists were dissing this country and slagging POWs and KIAs.  But get some black folks taking a respectful knee in protest of state violence directed against other black folks and that flag has never been waved harder.  In this case, patriotism really is the last refuge of a scoundrel."

"Hillary Clinton lost because she didn't inspire enough voters in the Black, Latino and Asian communities to vote for her in the same proportion that they voted for Mr Obama....I know that's not as appealing to some as Russian deviousness, FBI deep state animosity, and the ever-useful, ""misogyny""....but sometimes hubris and believing your own press is really at the core of why you lose...sometimes, it's just about you. .

"You never really answered my first question, as to what form of protest you would find acceptable.

As for the BLM protests, you get a few hundred or a few thousand people out protesting, there will always be a few idiots who think that property damage is the way to go.  The football players are protesting at their jobs, 2 extremely different things.  You are trying to compare apples and automobiles."
"Protesting is what makes America great and it helps society in general.  If we didn't have protests, the Vietnam war could still be going on, Women like Moi couldn't vote and blacks may still be sitting in the back of the bus.  Now Moi may not vote and therefor doesn't care but a lot of women do."
"Why should priests bother with penitents? Dishing out all that grace, helping people avoid eternal damnation in the red hot flames of Hell, listening to long shopping lists of sins while pretending that you don't know who is talking, - knowing full well that some of them are making stuff up! - then getting gossiped about if you actually encourage someone to come back to communion, showing that forgiveness ACTUALLY means you are forgiven....

...and then all the thanks you get is a pair of black socks at Christmas. 😡"
Maybe that's what happened in the last election? We don't know where that dark money came from.
"The work permit is only part of the equation. 

For an employer to employ someone with a general work permit the following applies according to

""General Work Visa
The General work visa is issued to a foreign employee who has obtained a position with a SA company. The visa will only be issued if the employer demonstrates that national job recruitment efforts in the local media were fruitless...""

This process is arduous and can take manymonths to conclude. Not many employers are able to wait while these processes are complied with, leading them not to consider foreign nationals.

Scarce skills visas require ...""The applicant must demonstrate that they have said critical skills such as holding an advanced degree or publications in their field. They must register with the specialized SA professional group...""

"In retrospect, signing Desmond to a $70m / 5 yr deal was a big mistake.  He and Cargo are the Rox 2 highest paid players and both are big disappointments for the Rox so far.  When Parra & Dahl return, where will Black play Desmond?  Not at 1B I hope.  Reynolds has earned his spot there and unlike Desmond, is a bargain for what they're paying him.  Cargo & Desmond could well become 2 of the highest pd utility / pinch hitters in MLB."

"Caused and effect has been replicated in a longitudinal study. 

The study variables the were controled doesnt have to be exactly the same: two black parents and one at home, and from the same neighborhood and age, poverty, similar results with perhaps different metrics of success. 

For example the original study measured recent monthly income instead of annual income. Since many of these families would have difficulty with annual income records, this was the most accurate method. Sampling more than once a year yielded a statistically significant result since the differences between the groups were so large.

Another thing is unforeseen events which affected many in both groups iirc like a plant closure."
"Sorry Alberta. 

Oil will likely stay around $50/pbl. So whomever is premier will have to deal with it. 

Personally I never found Jason Kenney to be particularly appealing. But hey, that's just my uniformed opinion. 

However if he wants to start fighting with everyone, even though it might give everyone in Alberta something to cheer about, I suspect he will end up getting ""less"" cooperation rather than ""more""."
"There are so many places in this country and the world that need attention, from American bridges and highways to the Middle East, and it is obvious that integrating all the wonderful people of America into a safe and loving community is last on Trump's to-do list. While Bannon exults at the thought of gaining support of those left behind by the crushing power of global cutthroat capitalism, I don't think I ever saw a plan from him to correct things, probably because they involve some sort of socialism and guaranteed jobs programs.
It sure seems easy to get to power utilizing fear and hate. That was what Bannon and Trump did. Pretty much what the far right does anywhere, from Israel 's Netanyahu to Russia's Putin.

To hate someone because they have a different skin color or religion, like Islam or Judaism, is evil but sure seems the path for empty people to gain power. I hate the apartheid hurting the Palestinian People but still respect Judaism.

"We need to throw out the phrase ""radical economic transformation"" and replace it with the phrase and an ideological shift to ""radical economic growth"". When will it be understood that wealth creation and not the redistribution of wealth is what is required."
Oh cut the disingenuous far-right talking point. The Democratic party of the 1800s has no bearing on the Democratic party of today. Neither does the Republican party. What DOES have relevance is ideology. Slavery was undeniably a conservative institution. Conservatives went to war to preserve their right to own and oppress other people. Conservatives left the Democratic party in droves over the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts. The modern day Republican party is made of of the very same people that left the GOP over the notion of treating black people with respect. Ever hear the term Southern Democrat? That's the modern GOP.
"Why can’t one find the survey itself….beyond just a report from AP? As MichaelG said, why do they think he's not legitimate? Because they don't understand the Constitution or because it was a terrible survey question, like most of SA's daily Big Q?? Nobody should take a poll result at face value any more than Facebook.  Interested in their approach, survey questions, and methodology, I gave up trying to find a presentation of the survey itself.  If the Black Youth Project or the Associated Press or NORC (National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago) are going to publish the survey itself, I think it would be reasonable to publish it at the same as they publish the news story. But again, it’s not about the facts, it’s about winning the argument.  The fact that GenForward and BYP-NORC “pays special attention to the voices of young adults of color”, is certainly admirable. But it clouds the issue of being representative of all 18-30 year old people across the U.S."

"As Florida has almost twenty times Hawaii's population, I wouldn't be surprised if in absolute terms they have more of everything including crime.  But as I've pointed out elsewhere, one needs to take statewide statistics with a huge grain of salt.  While I've yet to be blessed with a free all expenses paid vacation to south Chicago or east L.A., I have wandered about well after midnight in parts of Washington D.C. (excluding the ""Green Zone"" of the Capital Mall) as well as parts of east Baltimore often regarded as pretty turbulent turf comparable to some of the ""bad"" areas in Chicago.  I was never molested or bothered at all during these nocturnal sojourns, and was armed with nothing more lethal than my Pentax SLR camera, a penlight and a SAK.  The most excitement I had was when an elderly woman carrying shopping bags (from 7-Eleven?) fled at my approach and when some black dude mistook me for a cop.

"I'll never deny the possibility of being wrong.  Inshaa Allah (God Willing) I retain enough of a conscience to refrain from sliding into the 'evil' category.

But I still maintain that Mr. Pitts (with whom I disagree as often as not), wasn't taking the position in his article that you've ascribed to him, per your above post.  I believe he was arguing that those who decry injustice usually serve ""truth, justice and the American way"" better than those who denounce them for doing so.  I agree with that.

There are too many knee-jerk attempts to drown-out dissenting voices by reviling rather than refuting said voices' arguments.  Such as shrieking ""RACIST!"" when someone has the temerity to question police-actions against black folks OR express criticism of a particular political leader 'of color', ""ANTI-SEMITE!"" when someone criticizes ""Israel's"" mistreatment of Palestinians (who are Semites, BTW) or ""HOMOPHOBE!"" when mentioning that some gay-rights activists' claims lack scientific basis."
"The vitriol presently directed at President Trump and his family is just a mirror image of the vitriol that was directed at President Obama and his wife Michelle. We can be opposed to the policies of those who disagree with us, but what we have now is directed toward persons and their identities. Conservatives never could get beyond the fact that President Obama was a Black man, despite his being raised in a Caucasian family, graduating from Punahou School and initially putting out his hand to them to work with him. The Kennedys were as wealthy as the Trumps, but they were not criticized by the press for their wealth. The Democratic elite is as race / ethnicity conscious as the Republicans. The agenda of both parties should be to generate policies which will lift up all those of those in need regardless of their race, ethnicity, gender, age, religious beliefs sexual orientation, etc."

The last thing the Rockies is need is another guy swinging from the heels, so I'm glad Lucroy isn't taking that approach."

"To any citizen stopped by a law enforcement officer, if you are carrying or transporting a gun, a knife, or any improvised weapon, concealed or otherwise, your first question should be, ""Am I free to go?""  If the answer is anything but ""yes"" then prudence dictates you should next clearly inform the officer that you have a weapon in your possession.  Your next question should be, ""Officer, what do you wish me to do next?""  Living through the next few minutes then depends on you complying with what the officer asks you to do.  If you are impaired by drugs illicit or otherwise, or have a chip on your shoulder, then may the luck of Allah, Jesus, Yahweh, the Buddha or Odin smile upon you."
"I can get behind that. Washington and his weird wife were major slaveholders. Only reason slavery lasted as long as it did was because of attitudes that it wasn't that bad of a thing. By honoring slaveholders, we today are saying the same, that it was just an ""old timey"" thing, and we should just understand and move on. 
I understand that humans were bought in Africa, condemned to be transported and often killed in the the process, separated from kin, and beaten and sometimes worked to death. Nothing in that is inspirational, nothing in that says those who profited from the murderous activity deserve respect.Lots of people in prison do good things, but then they kill someone or kidnap someone. One day this country will honor the suffering and lives of the slaves by dishonoring the terrible people who treated them so badly.

If I were black and had to go to class in a building named for a slavery advocate, I would feel like the University valued him and slavery.

"For argument's sake, assuming you're right that blackface is acceptable social behavior, that wouldn't invalidate her point that probably most people don't think it's okay. Her point was that if we were to use society's general acceptance of a behavior as a litmus test, blackface would most likely fail while sombreros would not."
"This is truly sickening and a huge black mark on the Canadian judicial system. This judge should be completely ashamed of himself and should step down. The evidence in this case clearly suggests she was not capable of consenting and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out. Who in there right mind would think that an intoxicated women who just urinated on herself would consent to sex at all, let alone with a strange taxi driver in the back seat in a secluded area. A little common sense goes a long way and this judge had a chance to set a precedence but instead chose to be a coward just like the accused."
"This is a plan doomed for failure that will keep organized crime in the cannabis industry. First, the quality of product from LPs does not measure up to that produced by the cottage industry. Clients will know this and opt to get their cannabis from cottage growers.  Second, even the government of the day back in the prohibition era understood thy could not control the manufacture of booze, which is why they set out standards then allowed private enterprise to handle production. 
Third, the issue of disease. Large LPs will spread bugs far and wide, whereas cottage grower infestations are isolate to the growers immediate clientele.
All this will do is keep the black market thriving. Totally wrong headed plan."

They have a harmonious society because they do not flood their countries with immigrants. Most Asians won't be marring a farang either, their parents want them to marry in their own caste and culture. If the do marry a foreigner it will be for the money or passport. If you are so Canadian why not marry another Canadian? Sounds like you are in for a rude awaking..."
"All of the high profiled black men and teenagers that were murdered in the past three years, Davis.  I have no intention of persuading you one way or another.  I see and listen to the local, state, and national news and formal investigations.   What about the shooting of five Dallas police officers; early reporting coming out of Dallas indicated that 2-4 snipers were involved.  As of early afternoon today, now Dallas is  reporting only one shooter was involved and not 2-4.  Media outlets trample each other to get the first stories out, triggering misinformation.  It's amazing what anyone can see and hear when bigotry and racism isn't involved."
"And here’s your quote of the day, from one John Ellis Bush, on Trump tweeting out a picture of him eating a taco bowl to honor Cinco de Mayo:

“What Trump did was so insensitive,” Bush told NRC. “First, not all Hispanics are Mexican. Secondly, not all Hispanics eat tacos. Thirdly, showing your sensitivity by eating an American dish is the most insensitive thing you can do. Fourthly, to say this, next to all things he already said, is a further insult. It’s like eating a watermelon and saying ‘I love African-Americans.’”

​​
“This guy,” Bush added. “If we lose in November, we Republicans have ourselves to blame.”

Hard to argue with that, Jeb."
"Personally, I feel that opportunity, implicit bias, inconsistent discipline, and a number of other things contribute to the problem.  I personally believe that all students are capable of being successful in school.  I also feel that family and community are also responsible for the success of students.

I see previously that someone mentioned starting a school to support African American students, which is also my plan."
"Wow! Seven lies in seven sentences.  

How many black Americans know the Republican Party was formed in 1854 as the anti-slavery party—even as Democrats founded the Ku Klux Klan in 1866? How many know President John Fitzgerald Kennedy, (who voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957) along with his brother Atty. Gen. Robert Kennedy, had Martin Luther King wire-tapped by the FBI in the hope they could prove he was a Communist?

How many Americans of any ethnic persuasion know Martin Luther King Sr was a Republican? How many know it was Republicans who established the NAACP?"
"Even our Governor spends every day circumventing the rule of law. Using multiple no bid contracts to avoid going over the singular legal limit. Hiring back the former guy to do the present gals job since the poor guy had to leave...lie, cheat, steal...

So let me ask you this. How is it that we expect the victims to be law abiding but not the leaders of the nation? We allow law enforcement to play by their own set of rules. We allow the Pentagon and CIA and NSA etc... to outsource illegal terrorist activities like those committed at black sites by contractors? We allow every right to be conditionally administered by what then can only be rightly called our master. How can we have corrupt politician that nobody likes after corrupt politician that nobody likes who constantly bend the law until it breaks only to rewrite it for their own purposes and yet turn to the little guy and tell him to straighten up and fall in line, rule of law and all that? The rule of what law? Seriously which?"

"One reason is  fear and anger from people who see Civil and Human Rights as some kind of finite good like a pie. They're afraid that if someone else gets some, they'll somehow get less. Which of course makes  no sense at all. 

 Another problem is the misinterpretation of the Bible by generations of Christians and a mule-headed unwillingness to rethink anything based upon modern science. For example, Blacks were considered inferior and worthy of slavery for centuries based on Genesis 9:20-27 where Canaan  and all his descendants were cursed to be slaves because of the mistake of Canaan's father, Ham, at seeing his father's nakedness. Of course we now know that this wasn't directed at blacks, (Canaan's skin color isn't even mentioned!) but as a justification for the Israelite invasion of the land of the Canaanites.

In the same way, Biblical texts about male on male sex in the Bible are misinterpreted as modern Biblical studies and science prove yet many refuse to see that."
"It's worth noting that anglers have several other options available for descending devices that have been available for a while. Sheldon's Fish Descender  is very similar to what was described here. Ace Calloway , and Seaqualizer are also good options-- the latter automatically releases fish at preset depths

The ability of rockfish to recover after re-compression is supported by a growing body of scientific literature.  One of the most important factors determining whether a fish will survive is how quickly they are released back into the water, and not how they look externally. See:

""Recovery potential of black rockfish, Sebastes melanops,  recompressed following barotrauma"" A.L. Pribyl  et al. (2012)

""The effects of barotrauma on the catch-and release survival of southern California nearshore and shelf rockfish (Scorpaenidae, Sebastes spp.)"" Jarvis and Lowe (2008)

"""since natural products are un-patentable, they are unprotected.""
That is false. Take a look at ""Cold FX"", for eg. As to research, so much on the internet is false and dangerous. There are effective ""natural"" products such as some herbs, but they are not without side-effects (look up St. John's Wort), and it is not always safe to self-prescribe. With the current lack of regulations, you may not even be getting the herb as labelled and it is likely laced with pesticides, and may contain other dangerous contaminants. Some also contain black market prescription drugs such as a ""natural ED"" product which men with cardiac conditions took instead of Viagra only to end up in the hospital as the product was actually laced with Viagra (so guess what, it worked). This product was never tested for safety until it hit the market and was reported after men had cardiac issues. That is not right! The industry is not regulated at all."
"""As a result, there will probably be no reform of the personal income tax.""

This strikes me as possibly the most important sentence in Tom Reese's article. It seems to me that most of his rationale for tax reform failing has to do with fear of voter reactiosn, and that reaction is determined by expectations of how people's personal taxes are affected. 

Far fewer people pay attention to the affects of taxation on corporations. And the fact is, Trump and the Republicans are determined more than anything else to lower corporate taxes. Blow black is far less likely. Since Trump and the congress now need a WIN, any WIN, the odds, its seems to me, of a successful reduction of corporate taxes is very likely. 

The argument that lower corporate taxes increase jobs, although repeatedly demonstrated, generatoin after generation, country after country, to be false, is a self evident truth for Trump and the Repubs. Trump's base will be fed and will feast on this delusion. Ergo its a done deal."
"You didn't judge me? Hint: when you say to me: ""I bet people ""like you"" made excuses for slavery,..

Your point, if someone kills with their car, with ""intent"" to kill, verses an accident with  no ""intent"", it is view & penalized differently.  I'm not saying she was right in doing it (I believe she didn't think through how her actions would be perceived by others, based on past history)  but her ""intent"" was not to purposely harm or ""Mock an entire race for kicks"", based on info provided. Thus I don't think she should be penalized as you described.
As your ""intent"" was not to Stereotype or Judge me, but you did, but I will accept your ""intent"" was to not, as you were just trying to make your point, that you feel strongly about.

Our country has been going about the drug epidemic all wrong incarceration and policing does not improve the drug problem in fact it has shown to make things worse look at the mass incarceration of young black males in the 90's because of our ""WAR ON DRUGS"".Throwing money at the justice system does not help either. I think we need to understand addiction. It is a BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL disease meaning it cant be attacked one way there is a lot of factors that have to be considered. Portugal has decriminalized drug use and treats addiction as a public health issue rather than a criminal justice issue and it has shown to reduce drug use and drug deaths.
If it is a tax payer cost issue then all research show treating addiction as a public health issue is the most cost effective way."

"50 years ago, you were guaranteed a middle class life in Canada with minimal school work. Because Canada competed for jobs with 500 million westerners.

"I used to do a bird mortality count for Coast Watch at Shi Shi and one of the women in the group had her van broken into while she slept in it. The young braves were drunk and tried to talk her into going to a party with them. She agreed, then ditched them as soon as they got back into Neah. 

While picking up litter at Bahahobash Point I came across a group of six young braves, one of whom wanted to fight me immediately. A young chief saved my life likely by saying he liked that I was picking up trash. If I hadn't had that big black bag of garbage in my hands I might have been in that car.

But the Rox are going to need to keep up this pitching with a bunch of kids and Chatwood, who is like Jekyl and Hyde.  I hope they can do it.

"You're woefully short on your understanding of MLK. First, he advocated ""militant non-violence"". He espoused the belief that violence meant the message was completely lost. Second, MLK consistently expressed the belief that people would be judged by their character and not the color of their skin.  All people. Finally, and most importantly, MLK expressed the Christian belief that people can change and find redemption. 

Today, we have outreach efforts to gang members who kill, rob, and engage in unlawfulness. Similarly, people who embrace racist ideologies are morally lost. MLK always stated that people are morally equal. He believed in engagement. 

Consequently, violence is always wrong. Engagement to bring people away from fringe elements should always be the goal. No one has a right to engage in vandalism or destruction of property because they mistakenly believe they're morally superior to everyone else."
"Better late than never, Jeff, but the rest of us have been awake since January.  Too bad you were on the team that mocked the women's march in February.  Too bad you were on the team that decided to take the budget reconciliation path and railroad through the GOP version of health insurance repeal and tax cuts for the rich.  Too bad you said NOTHING as Trump attacked Hispanics, Muslims, Gays, Transgender, Blacks, Democrats, the poor.  So now that he's attacking you personally, you pen a letter advising the rest of us to ""wake up"". 
Jeff, I believe the phrase that applies is ""pot calling the kettle black"".

"Haycox uses the term ""ownership"" and its cognates in three different senses, without differentiating among them.  So he compares oranges to apples to bananas and comes up with the fruity conclusion that the Tlingit lost ""their"" land with the Purchase.  

Aboriginal title did not imply possession of the land: Native Americans did not think any man had power to fix limits to the environment and were puzzled at the European belief that this was the only ""civilized"" way to live.  Imperial title was chiefly a matter of conquest, exploitation of the Native people, and defense of commercial interests against European encroachers.  Common-law title is what we are familiar with, and it is the sense that Haycox anachronistically projects backward to the situation in 1795, and then in 1867.  It's not possible to ""give back"" the Tlingit land in the common-law sense, for the aboriginal Tlingit themselves never defined it that way."
"It's really pretty simple.  Bush Jr. took us far in the wrong direction, he and the R's had very little of the countries support at the end.

"If look at the map issued by the city of Creswell you will see 3-4 locations someone could open a store and compete with us. I am unsure why that fact is missed by you. We have a prime location, but so does many other businesses. AM/PM enjoys a prime location on gas sales in the area, but that doesn't mean 76 Station cant open. 

As only one of those people has a position within One Gro (and is retail not sales, our VP of Sales is a former executive from Hitachi). It is easy to suggest that no companies hire anyone with a criminal background. But Oregon is ground zero for the black market. If you deny these people the ability to use their skillset for good legal ways, they will use them for bad illegal ways. That's the reality. I personally would like no one to have a checkered past, but just as the people who helped design the alcohol distribution network we use today after prohibition had connections to black market bootlegging, the marijuana industry will have a transition."

Collins said Vernon Davis told him,  they don't disrespect the flag they just want to be heard, and Davis said he'd like to talk to Trump, Davis plays for the Redskins. OK fine. Where are these stories of how blacks in the NFL made it. Why aren't black players going into inter-city black communities to sharing their story? The answer is, it doesn't fit the template. Most of the stories are of young black men, making it despite the government. Being more than they can be, working, committing to a dream, or a goal. Get the government involved and the work ethic and commitment decrease. What happens to government low income housing after a few years? Many of the players that kneel, made to the NFL because of themselves, not some government program, or hand out."

"Couple of comments:  First off the symptoms described are exactly those that I myself feel when I ingest a large amount of alcohol quickly.  Disorientation, black out, memory loss.  It may be that the bartender's sin is putting lots of booze in the drinks rather than diluting them with mixers.  Some patrons and some bartenders think giving lots of straight booze is a favor.  Second, normally, a person needs a motive.  It appears that the bartender did not approach or take advantage of the women affected.  It is hard to imagine a motive.  Third, it would be very important if the women involved knew each other or had prior heard allegations of misbehavior by the bartender.  Very strange.  As usual, many commenters here project their evil selves on to the bartender and believe that just being accused is proof of misbehavior."

I fail to see the value in debating the above issues in a political forum.  With few exceptions you can't  even  openly debate these topics in college without creating endless protest (AKA riots), or being called a bigot, racist, islamaphobe, etc. I refer you to Evergreen State College as one example.   So to the candidates, go ahead and debate those issues.  Just remember, if you want to remain a valid candidate, you essentially have to agree with these groups, because their goal historically is not to promote speech, but to eliminate it and honest debate from the opposition.  Think safe spaces for the left.  On a side note, it would be refreshing to debate issues that affect tax payers.  See what I did there?

"Actually, shame on you.  Such simplistic views are either a sign of privilege or ignorance - why Kaep is doing what he is.  You think having money makes them immune from hate/racism/police brutality? (and people wonder why black lives matter too exist).

"His motivation? Well he was active in politics until the DNC pushed out his man, he then immersed himself in what his local official was doing, which is exactly what our local folks are doing, voting lockstep with the GOP. Maybe he saw the loss of clean water and air, healthcare and tax giveaways to the rich as anti American since it looks like pay to play like many another Banana Republic where everything is rigged against you, maybe he had a Black friend whose family had been treated like this since they were dragged to the land of freedom where the rich had everything and the poor had nada. Perhaps he was decended from the indentured class that only got food enough to survive on and cast off clothing from dead people for 7 years of slavery. Maybe he had 58,000 of his peer group killed in nam for no reason, or had friends that were disabled vet's that couldn't get decent medical care from another silly and pointless  conflict.
Maybe he tried to live like a real Christian....powerless"

"The National Council of the Churches of Christ in the USA, usually identified as the National Council of Churches (NCC), is the largest ecumenical body in the United States.[1] NCC is an ecumenical partnership of 38 Christian faith groups in the United States. Its member communions include Mainline Protestant, Orthodox, African American, Evangelical, Josephite and historic peace churches. Together, they encompass more than 100,000 local congregations and 40 million adherents.[2] It began as the Federal Council of Churches in 1908, and expanded through merger with several other ecumenical organizations to become the National Council of Churches in 1950.[3]"
"I'm skeptical of this psychology research into teaching evaluation ratings. It also doesn't help that this article doesn't elaborate on the general methodology of that research. I think that having a correlation between racial minority/female and lower teaching outcome offers limited insight. It would be more meaningful if the study had an auditor to evaluate the instructor against the students average ratings. In particular, instructors of color who have a thick accent or struggle to speak clearly shouldn't be included in the study for bias as their ratings would be lower because of their poor communication skills. In my own experience as an engineering student, I strongly question the role of bias in a student's perception simply because the material is so hard that most could care less what the instructor looks like. Professors who can effectively explain difficult concepts clearly, are highly respected and valued by students. Speaking of bias, couldn't research be biased?"
"The lady doth protest too much, methinks. So many big guns at the press conference, so many denials, so many assurances - that makes me suspicious. I suspect that a move was made to tap the PIC, and that there has been an attempt to discredit Matjila prior to booting him out, but thanks to a vigilant media there was a violent backlash from unions. South African workers are not as trusting of the State's benevolent intentions as they used to be.  The Zuptas have discovered that touching ANC-voting civil servants on their pensions is a step too far. Round 1 to the PIC. Nevertheless, that Matjila quickstep needs to be watched."
"If we have to always be on the lookout for something that might be offensive to someone, somewhere even if it wasn't meant to be offensive - how do we live?

A family with cotton on a stem as a part of a floral arrangement or as a centerpiece was offensive to a black person because it reminded her of slavery.  My friend has a boat-themed room - is that offensive because slaves came over on a boat?

The response here is just over-the-top.  Not everything has to be a personal attack and offensive.  This behavior is contributing to the political/social/race divides in our country."

"Not even close to true, football funds all the other sports at least at CU.  In the last few years, men's basketball has been in the black. Students pay a $28.50 athletic fee per semester but that doesn't come close to funding any sports and that includes a football pass and basketballs pass, I know that facts don't fit in your little diatribe against college sports but there you go.  Athletics is auxiliary funded at CU, not a drop of tuition or general fund money supports athletics.  If athletics didn't exist, that money wouldn't be there."
"Thanks for noting that, Charles.  Racial injustice is baked into American culture, and Chicago is a compelling example of this. We illustrate for all the world of how un-necessary Jim Crow laws actually were. Segregation, intimidation,  separate and unequal access to education, housing, work, and prison. 

No party has earned the right to hold its head high. And sadly, few parishes have.  I appreciate Cupich's efforts on this, and hope his flock follows. The respect Fr. Pfleger has earned in the black community has long been countered by disparagement and worse from  outside the ghettos. Perhaps Cupich will be able to help more people understand that we are all neighbors here, brothers and sisters, enabling more of us to act according to that truth. The sad tendency has been that the worse things become, the more profoundly those suffering are abandoned."

"The Articles are now treated in Anglicanism as historical statements only, and with the possible exception of Sydney Aus. (deeply evangelical) and a few places in Africa, hold very little purchase. As to Transubstantiation, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but I had to laugh. A gazillion RC worldwide take communion regularly, and couldn't explain the dogma if a billion dollar prize was on offer. I suspect many of them would not affirm it it if they knew about it, in any case yet we are called upon to affirm it?  Besides it is one explanation for Real Presence, not the only one."

"Have you been paying attention the last few years?  The whole ""Black Lives Matter"" movement came about because of the growing awareness among people of color that they are being held today in a form of oppression and imprisonment not that different than from the days of Nat Turner.  If we don't want a popular insurrection today, we need to completely reform our criminal justice system and policing practices - and do it sooner rather than later."
"Couldn't agree more.  That's the best thing about Buddy Black, if you're not doing the job, a change is going to be made.  Chatwood's pitched some gems over his career, but he was a mess much of the season.  Buddy was not happy with his wildness and let him know.  I give Chatwood credit for picking himself up however.  The past few years Brothers and Belisle were bouncing the ball up to the plate, but Walt Weiss just kept trotting them out there.  Tyler Anderson was huge tonight, and Cargo plus Story have been coming up big just in time.  Great time of year!"
"Hiking down into the canyon is no joke. Black Canyon hikers need to start early, and be incredibly cautious as the trails have steep vertical drops and a lot of loose rock. I did the S.O.B. hike last summer on the North Rim (a wilderness permit was required) at Black Canyon, and despite our early start and decent pace, by the time we got down to the bottom of the canyon (and it set in that we had to hike back UP the 1800 vertical feet in 1.75 miles we just came down), the sun had made its way to the rim we had to hike back up, and it was unbelievably hot. If the Gunnison Route that this woman was on was similar to the S.O.B. (and from the Black Canyon website, it looks like it is), there truly is no flat place to stand during the entire hike (you stop hiking, you're holding on to something to keep you up)...which explains why her sons may not have been able to help as quickly as they could have otherwise. Very, very sad."
Wonder how many of the loudest protesters in Black Lives Matter are paying the thousands of dollars for a game seat?  Prices are going to go way down real soon.
everyone knows you stay still until the officer reaches your window. you don't make any movements until they tell you. the officer is not guilty just following procedure. stay still if you are ever pulled over. you hunch or slouch or move cops are trained to take that as a sign of aggression or reaching for a weapon. so this was a case where the black guy got himself shot by being careless in front of police. an accident yes but a truly careless one at that.
"Heartbreaking, this is no consolation for this loss, but I can still say this team has really shown improvement this year, and they are capable. Hopefully this loss will be the fuel that fires this team next year, this loss was heartbreaking for fans and the team alike. It's a loss like this that can fuel the furnace, build on, and forge the future, because these players are, and were, competitors in every sense of the word. 

The pitching failed last night, the bats were fighting, but in truth, this young pitching rotation has yet to mature fully, and who better than an ex-pitcher like Mr. Black as coach, to bring it to full fruition and maturation of being consistently competitive, going into the future. 

This season has truly shown what can be, and that has been a remarkable improvement over the many seasons they were out of it, sometimes before the All-Star break.

Other than this loss, no regrets for the direction this team is going. Power on through, never quit the fight!"
"The article reminds up of Jesus' words , ""Physician heal thyself"", and the need for personal virtue. Who would argue against this? 

But the quote  and the Catholic point about virtue reminds us that personal reform and  goodness come first; not only in terms of personal salvation but also with respects to  society. A good society depends upon good people. 

The above underscores a great divide which separates many in the Church. Liberals seem to place social relationships and structures above matters of personal virtue and belief. They stress the ""systemic"" nature of sin, and downplay personal responsibility. They see social activism and fixing the ""system"" as the way to ""salvation"". In this scenario they attribute almost church like attributes to the state and confer upon it amoral superiority. 

Sin is thought of in terms of Social attitudes regarding certain social categories (women, aliens, blacks, gays etc...), and true sin is  downplayed."
"The 97 year old is correct. he and others fought for that right. The president and fans also have a right to disagree and make their feelings known. Athletes who are ""protesting"" think the bigger picture is about police violence towards african Americans.....isn't it really about lawlessness and one racial groups inability to right it's own ship?"
"""Although I did not hear specific references to women's ordination to the priesthood, the possibility of women deacons and women's preaching were openly discussed.""

This is the problem.  Never should women allow themselves to be talked into not demanding exact & same ordination & treatment as men in our church.  

This is where NCR, pushing a ""Future Church"" agenda, needs to asks itself what role has it played & is still playing in supporting sexism & misogyny in our church.  

Would NCR or Future Church recommend that Martin Luther King,  Jr. fight for just a few more rights for blacks, every few centuries, and miss the point completely, that the civil rights movement is about human dignity not just a slightly better seat on the bus?  

NCR has somehow been highly infiltrated by ""Future Church"" and all this group really cares about is getting married men ordination even if that can only result in the huge injustice of gender segregation.  

Do not buy into this very harmful tactic."
"Bad assumption.  I made Eagle Scout and I was a Scout Master for many years, and I know boys at that age.  Their has always been good reason for segregating boys in that environment as they focus much better....this is true in scouts, it is true in many private schools and it has been true in military basic training.  This has nothing to do with a girl defending herself...once the offense has been committed, the lawyers will come running for a quick settlement payday."
"This doctor's frustration is understandable, but there are so many wars going on in the world at the moment ... so many in the Middle East and parts of Africa.  No matter how many times other nations respond, the wars continue, and the flood of refugees grows every year.

The UNHCR (developed in 1951)  reported 45.2-million refugees between 2012 and 2013, but that figure was revised upward to 65-million this year. Over-population is obviously a big factor.  The five main trouble spots are Afghanistan, Somalia, Iraq, Syria, and Sudan.

As Jeffrey Simpson once commented, this war is a nasty modern manifestation of an old fight between Sunnis and Shiites, and between different schools of Sunni Islam.  In this struggle, the West is hard-pressed to support one side without inflaming the other(s).  This war has its roots in fanaticism & fundamentalism ... and over-population.  How can 'the world' (meaning Western nations usually) solve that?"

As for transgendered really would like to know what the extent of it is.  265 seems to be a  small number when compared to the total?"
"Ross Coen - People from that time as well as historians have made that generalization. I suppose some North and South regretted the demise of slavery. Lincoln, before becoming president, reportedly made the statement that ""Slavery is like holding a wolf by the ears, you can't hold on and you can't let go"". This is not a time when people in the country should become reactionary and forget compromise. History can't be undone. Good men, all of them Americans, fought and died for the Confederacy for reasons as legitimate as those who fought for the Union. By executive order President Lincoln decreed that all Confederate veterans were to treated as Americans. If this can't be reconciled, then the country will be torn apart again.   

Personal attacks are a failure of intellect, not argument."

"Good for you Hugh for making this point.  Looking back at 150 years ago, it's hard for us moderns to comprehend that slavery was the biggest issue of the day by far, and Americans were split on it...that it divided Americans from the beginning..... that it  often crushed the bodies and minds of its victims...... that young women were raped to produce more slaves....and it took a war  with over 600,000 deaths to finally end it.
AND what it meant that Mathew  P.  Deady was considered  Oregon's strongest slavery advocate......and that had he prevailed, Oregon could have ended up on the side of the South with destructive internal Civil War, much like Missouri.   Thank God Deady's position  was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters.

AND yet-- in  his later judicial decisions he was often protective of minority rights, especially Chinese, and in his personal life he showed no racism, with both of his bailiffs being blacks, and of course he did so much for Oregon and the UO....

  In an era of puritanical mass conformity and fear of being different, rock 'n roll was about sex, rebellion, danger, and giving black folks their due credit for their amazing contributions to American culture.
   After Elvis was grabbed by the army, he lost his mojo. When he was co-opted by Hollywood he didn't rock much. When he started playing Las Vegas he was done.

Is it any wonder that this same moral code allows DEMOCRATS to support AND promote partial “birth” baby murder by the millions so that the black population can be kept in check?  Is it really a surprise that the only surviving political party left on Earth that supported slavery now actively supports infanticide, genocide and the violence necessary to carry it out?"
"The article makes eminent sense. A harm reduction approach is far better public policy than prohibition. It substantially reduces the black market and everything associated with it. We don't bat an eye at some ""drugs"", such as caffeine, alcohol, or (to a lesser extent) nicotine, but we make others illegal. The social costs from alcohol are staggering (absenteeism, reduced productivity, violence, accidents, health care, etc, etc), but recreational use of the drug is completely accepted. And governments tax the heck out of it. There's no logic to the current way we think about ""drugs"".

What's missing from the discussion is serious consideration of demand. WHY do so many people want whatever a drug gives them? To self-medicate for physical or mental health issues? To ""escape"" from miserable circumstances? ""Just for fun""? Let's have a serious discussion of why the demand exists in the first place, and formulate public policy that focuses on demand reduction and harm reduction."
"Chuck, I still dig in Washington and we get black shelled clams all the time. They are usually older larger clams and are called ""mossbacks"" locally.  They are usually found on the beaches that don't get dug as often due to where they are located and where fish and game decides to open. The beaches that are open the most and get dug hard have the least mossbacks.  We harvest 2.5 to 3 million clams per year here between the Columbia River and Moclips. That's roughly 60 to 70 miles of beach.  On weekend digs in the spring, we get over 1,000 people per mile of beach. So unless a beach is mostly closed during the year, most clams don't live long enough to turn black shelled.  But I just dug last week in the Moclips area and got a limit of all black shelled clams.

Obama Care, while suffering startup pains, and needing fixes, has generally been successful.

"The real world.  Hmmm.  You say the marketplace of ideas is ""the real world,"" and you imply it is therefore true.  Well, the ""real world"" South until 50 years ago was full of lynchings.  The real world of some Muslim countries allows the stoning of gays, even today.  Why?  Because in their marketplace of ideas, those ideas are the most popular.  Is it true that blacks should be lynched?  That gays should be stoned?  So there you have it:  The marketplace of ideas --- like any marketplace --- measures popularity, not truth."

I never looked at either side as being good or bad. Maybe because after the Civil War, so many people moved West. I may have considered it more of an invasion by the US Military.  
I kept my interest in the Civil War, eventually I visited the Ford Theater and the room across the street where Lincoln died.  My opinion is the war was anything but ""Civil"""
"You have two different issues.   One is protecting the people of the neighborhoods, the other is a protest against police brutality.   Your making presumptions from your perspective without really knowing more than what you see on TV.    You're not black, your don't live in the neighborhood, you don't know enough to say such a thing.    Honestly, neither do I   , But I know how a mother mourns the lose of a child, or child mourns for their dead mother or father.  

The point is that you have to make a commitment to the goal."
"""The president’s comments drew immediate backlash on social media from critics who perceived it as a reference to a still-living Douglass."" 

It's Black History Month and all those anti-Trump progressives don't even know who Frederick Douglass was!
They probably thought he meant Michael Douglas since they get their news from Entertainment Tonight."
"""No.  Jesus .......................""
A wonderful demonstration of why dialogue with REAL CATHOLICS is pointless."
"I agree with the broad thrust of the very important argument that is being made here. State sponsors of terrorism ought to be held accountable - that after all, is what the Bush Doctrine is all about.

It's necessary and urgent to put Pakistan in particular on the state sponsor of terrorism list.

Unlike many businesses who sell to them, I have not been bribed by Saudi Arabia and I am not prepared to turn a blind eye to any kingdom which sponsors terrorism.

The split in the GCC countries against Qatar is a case of the pot calling the kettle ""black"". They are implicated with the sponsorship of terrorism and it seems unfair to name Qatar without also naming Saudi Arabia as a state sponsor of terrorism.

Whether we agree or quibble over the details of which countries ought to go on the list I agree absolutely that names need adding."
"Groucho,

You call that judging? Please read Matthew 18:6 and 12:36. God takes our words and their impact on others very seriously.

If one thing has been made clear in the discussions about WO it is that neither side is going to persuade the other, so further argument is worse than worthless because it breeds animosity and mistrust between believers and makes a mockery of truth. More than that, it doesn't matter how right you are, if your view doesn't reflect God's love and redeeming power, you're potentially endangering the salvation of the spiritually weak, as has been illustrated to me in recent days. God wants us to be rivers of the pure, life-giving water of His love quenching the spiritual thirst of the people we meet, not distasteful, polluted streams that send them looking elsewhere for solutions and salvation."
"Yes indeed, the sun is shinning bright today! 

HB 165 is a big step forward. So easy to lose hope and become cynical about getting ""good government"" bills passed. When a key one does pass, time to pull out the stops and celebrate!  May it also fuel our march forward. 

A heartfelt thanks to Brian Black, Common Cause and the League of Women Voters for staying the course and to  Sens. Gil Keith-Agaran, Donna Mercado Kim and Karl Rhoads, Rep. Scott Nishimoto and the Office of Information Practices for their assistance and support."
"Black is right to read the riot act to not only the pitching staff but entire lineup. 2 outs and 2 strikes, so what, opposing batters have the Rockies right where they want them. Rockies pitching can't seem to finish innings lately. Not surprised by the run production either, this where a free swinging lineup gets you, 10 hits but only 1 run."
Physics has nothing to do with knowing that brown bears don't live in Colorado (not to mention the fact that they didn't say it was a brown bear) and that black bears are the only bears in Colorado.  And that the average size of a male is around 200# and females are 33% less.  But you almost had a point  And you do understand that a bear is highly unlikely to flip up an hit your windshield.
"Always need help?? No, not always, but at this point they do.  Social programs were not african american programs, the majority of poor are not african american."
"I agree with you on what you say about Black churches, but there should also be respect for church space as a no-talking zone.   Since coming back to the Church, i've noticed that many parishioners come early to mass only for the sake of kibbitzing with their friends.    This is a misuse of Church space."
"I think the Globe needs to be more selective about the articles it accepts for publication. As has been noted by most contributors, the article is about the US president and the US. We need fewer articles of that sort and more about what's  right about Canada. I suspect the author could have written a good piece about Black History here. His article, regrettably is just more of the same old."
"Back in the USSR, fake news was the mainstay of Pravda. When Pravda reported a bumper crop of wheat, the people knew they would go hungry. When Pravda reported women's winter boot production was at an all time high, they knew shops would be empty. When the Globe tells us about Trump's Endless Failures, we know he is doing his job."
"Trump actions continue with many racial actions of the past. 
- The war on native Americans, which was called the Red Terror in the 19th century, resulting in their near extermination and plunder of their land. 
- Racial actions on American Blacks
- Internment of Japanese and German U.S. citizens during the war

And now blaming certain Muslims on terror attacks on the U.S. But never ever admit that these are retaliations due to American military control of their lands, including unprovoked invasion of Iraq. 

Trump will find there is no need for this order. No refugees will come to America anymore."
"Trump did not say what flag he meant.  However, we can infer.  The logical assumption of which, would be the American Flag.  The one with the stars and stripes that are red, white, and blue.

At Trump's rallies, I see the familiar faces of groupies that follow him around the country.  Oh, and the one black guy that manages to snag a seat behind Trump?  Now, he's a *real* ""nut case"".  Check him out at his web site: Gods2.com

"""Speakers criticized as immoral ""the emergence of the prison-industrial complex and the immigration complex"" in which powerful, well-connected individuals ""have benefitted tremendously from locking up people of color, particularly African Americans and Latinos, but increasingly Arabs and Muslims,"" according to Rogelio Sáenz, dean of the College of Public Policy at the University of Texas at San Antonio.""

Racism and the profit motive meet up with the calls by the Trump administration to lock more people up for drug offenses.  That has been code since the Nixon administration to lock up more my minorities while making a fast buck with for-profit prisons."
"What is it with these Leftist protesters?!  Shouting down a United States Senator, or any other speaker, is really OTT (over-the-top).  This is despicable behavior, and it has become the norm in today's society.  From the Black Lives Matter movement to Univ. Cal.-Berkeley to Melissa Click at the Univ. of Missouri calling for some muscle to take away a student reporter covering her protest on the otherwise public campus, these agitators are ugly.  Period."
"I am not sure that the Church ever held that slavery was moral--at least at the universal level.  My understanding is that the Church tolerated the institution, then eventually condemned it.  

The problem in talking about slavery and what the Church did or did not teach is that we tend to look at slavery through the lens of the history of the African American struggle for liberation.  We see that the US bishops were largely silent when they should have spoken out against the institution. We conclude that the ""Church"" taught that slavery (as experienced by the African Americans) is moral.

It is true that the US bishops did not speak out as they should have--however the popes had already condemned slavery.  The bishops were just dissident---because of the political climate at the time.  They ignored and downplayed papal teaching on slavery. They pretended it did not exist or was not binding.

Not to sound like a liberal, but the issue is more ""nuanced"" than you think."
"The Loving v. Virginia case, which struck down miscegenation laws, was consonant with the 14th Amendment, and quite predictable, given the text of the Constitution.  You have not shown the error of my statement that the framers of the Constitution never DREAMED that the Amendment specifically intended to relieve blacks of racial discrimination would be used to REQUIRE the States to alter the universal definition of marriage.  

Your ""delight"" with the S.Ct.'s decision is consonant with neither the Constitution nor Catholicism nor Christianity.  Your delight is with the result of a rogue, lawless decision.  That's not American."
"Yes ............. Trump took credit for the 2% increase in the S&P 500
................. which is tiny compared to the black guys 310% increase"
"Could it be that black service folks proportionally commit more criminal offenses than others?  Nah, could never happen."
You are still writing about Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton?  I thought you were going to come up with new black folks to whine about.  No black friends?
"The tired old ""racism"" charge is getting a played out and isn't working anymore...the left really needs to work on its creativity. 

Don't forget which party used the Klan as its militant wing to keep blacks from participating in elections (Democrats). Let's also not forget who called the late Senator (and Grand Wizard of the K K K) Robert Byrd a ""friend and mentor"". That would be Hillary. Not Trump. But let's not let reality get in the way of you recycled talking points that you borrowed from some leftist cable news channel no one watches"
"When Trump won over your slave owner Clinton, you know full well that if you attack Trump you would find yourselves getting investigated, but you were sure you could get away with it because you use the race card, but that is failing too. Democrats can't even cheat and win an election. You sorry POS all Liberals and Democrats will be in jail soon, how will you stay in Politics then cheater? If Civil war come out of this for you cheating Democrats hiring thugs as actors in riots we will come for you asswipes first before we fight each other. How long do you think it will take for the black people find out your supporting slavery by protecting the Slave Masters the Democrats for your own gain?  I will make this Viral as fast as I can. Democrats refused to vote to abolish Slavery, and you are with them because to think the low income blacks are desperate enough to get paid to riot and convince the rest that Democrats will take care of them. Obama proved this fact, what did he do?"
"So if a black man experiences the promise of the Declaration he is experiencing ""black privilege""?

"I don't think you can ever speak for black people when you say they won't be offended, so best not to try."
"Allowing a business to use Religion as an excuse not to serve someone is the ultimate slippery slope to allowing a business owner to discriminate against anyone, for nearly any reason.  How is refusing to serve a gay couple now any different than the racists that refused to serve blacks or mixed raced marriages back in the 40's and 50's?  The answer - its not.  Its discrimination painted with a different brush and people are using the Bible as their shield.

And to be clear - no one in this case was forcing this baker to do anything different than what he already did for hundreds/thousands of customers before.  No one asked him to cater the wedding or write something on the cake that he found offensive.  It was simply the fact that a cake he was making was going to be used in a gay wedding.  Thats it.  So, based on that standard, could the owner of Hobby Lobby come out and say they no longer will sell any of their products to anyone who has had an abortion?  How is that any different?"
"""Black-bullied?"" Racist much?"
"Go to Mc Donalds.
Black teenager behind the counter takes my order.
Tells me amount I must pay before delivering my meal.
I am outraged, demand to see manager.
Black manager says I must pay, corporate policy. Looks at me like I'm crazy.
I throw fit, storm out of restaurant.
Go home and post rant on Facebook about racist black employees.
McDonalds corporate fires employees and gives me lifetime supply of burgers."
"Mike Dunham's request that we ""give black soldiers their due"" is a ridiculous one, at best.  This is not a new story: as other posters have stated, the role of black soldiers' contributions has already been reported in other publications.  Dunham claims ""their role was severely downplayed,"" yet never once states how.

Are black soldiers the only ones who ""suffered mightily from severe cold, clouds of mosquitoes, ice, muck, lousy equipment and poor supplies?""  It should be noted that this characterized the life of EVERYone who contributed to the Alaska Highway.  Why not honor and recognize the Army Corps of Engineers- all of them?

Wouldn't Alaskans stand to benefit from learning about ALL the varied groups who has contributed to this great stretch of road?  Presentation ceremonies and park benches to only a select group is exactly the type of micro-Cultural appropriation that has will continue to divide this country- we need to identify these demands for what they are- and stop them."
Wolf Eagle is only against Carson and says bad things because Carson is black. Its so obvious.
Just another example of the media elites  totally in the bag for Hillary. And if Trump DIDNT reach out to blacks they would nail him for that too! Consummate hypocrites.. CNN viewership now lower then the Food Network? Keep it up guys. You've destroyed any scintilla of objective neutrality left in journalism and instead transformed it into your personal propaganda machine. Reminds one of Hitlers propaganda efforts. Hillary may well be as corrupt. Efforts to use regulations and the judiciary  to silence Fox and conservative talk radio also remind us of another time. Many on the left would sack them if given a chance with Obamas DOJ to follow with a hand slap. College campuses crush free speech and shout down conservatives.  Planned Parenthood can openly boast of mutilating and selling baby parts and its all about the evil intentions of the people posing as potential buyers. Hilary's endless lies go on and on with almost daily revelations yet you coddle her.
"Oh I'm not surprised. When I was 19 years old, I spent 3 months in a homeless shelter. I had a group of weird Latina and black women look at me like I was garbage. Later on after they came to know me and like me, they apologized for thinking I ""looked like a Nazi"" when they first saw me. 

How did I ""look like a Nazi""? Because a lot of people know someone of ethnic German background when they see them."
Non south Africa s who are black and have received citizenship qualify now for being classed as black for BEE deals. They can get shares or qualify as black run business to provide goods or services
"The feds had to get involved in order to legalize mixed race marriages - it wasn't until 1967 that the US Supreme Court struck down state laws outlawing mixed race marriages.

And it wasn't until 1968 that a case claiming religious justification for not serving blacks in a restaurant made it to the Supreme Court."
"What happens , happens and 100% of the blame can be placed at the foot of the democrats, the liberal press, unions, college professors, Clinton, McCain, Obama, Graham, FBI and CIA..   If these people bent on the destruction of America have their way, it will be destroyed because these people did not let Trump do his job.     This asinine support for Clinton,  Obama, Soros, the Russian diversion and all this black lives crap has caused the squandering of precious time, resources , and energy of the Trump administration but most of all it has weakened our stance on the world stage and decreased the ability of the military to do their job.       I think people have lost their minds with the stupid stunts being played out today by the media.     Who cares if some black fool gets on his knees during a football game; who cares if people riot and tear up their own town because a thug gets shot by the police;   who cares if some hollywood clown screws some actress!    Nobody with any sense!!"
"Thats snowflake, thats a yuge chip on Pauls shoulder and he wants everyone to feel oppressed. He didn't approve of having a black president And now he and his ilk have a new N word to cling to, a new set of tired clichéd slogans to cheerlead.
Decoded, but they still use it to identify each other, like a big obvious wink."
"This response is so sick it should be funny. But it is actually prophetically scary.
I am ""inflaming the anxieties of the vulnerable and marginalized"" when I warn them that the big bad guys who hate them are on their way with sticks, stones and cudgles.  Next comes ""Strange Fruit"" for muslims as well as blacks. 
Remember the term: ""state sponsored terrorism"".  No longer ""over there"" but ""right here"".  Stand now people - ""should, woulda coulda"" is no excuse; turns no clock back.
If ""you"" are Jesus in time Church, that time is now."
"You might want to stop referring to black people as ""black folks""."
"Does he have a black friend too? Trump has two, so he's he's beating Dan there."
"Poverty increased, food stamp increases, debts and deficits increased greatly, black killing blacks increased exponentially in certain areas, auto debt record highs, student debt record highs, Middle East conflict never stopped. The saddest part is he got a peace prize for jack sh&&. That's obama basically."
"I can believe that blacks (particularly young black males) may be stopped more frequently by the police than other 'groups'. I've heard that often enough elsewhere. 

However I find it hard to believe people frequently make 'racist comments' in Toronto as I assume I would have witnessed some of this as I traveled around the city. And, quite frankly, I cannot recall a single instance where people directed racist comments at other people, including situations where someone got into an argument with someone else."
The legal ones hate the illegals more than anyone else since they are causing them problems by the behavior.  I know many Hispanics and also Blacks that are voting for Trump and actually encouraging others to do the same!  Maybe you can get a visitors pass to see Killary in her prison cell!
"Hey pot, its kettle, you're black.  PR went bankrupt for myriad reasons, not one as you claim.  Mostly they are strangled by federal regulations that help the mainland and don't give a thought to them.  things like the Jones act.  Not to mention that taxation without representation.

I wouldn't be surprised that if the feds continue to screw up the hurricane response, PR uses the incident to demand statehood."

"The police are a funny issue with American conservatives. One minute, police are tools of the Federal Gubmint, cummin' fer the gunz... then they execute an unarmed black man and the same conservatives are defending the police and calling them heroes."
"Really, you felt it necessary to add race conflict into this?     Black guys can 'pop a couple of caps' at people, so you get to shoot at people too?         

Take a deep breath Motley.     We're talking criminal vandalism here, but that's not generally a death penalty.     Besides I count on thinking that there are responsible gun owners, like Motley, then you go and suggest shooting would be OK for a punctured tire?    Under pressure, is that what we should expect from most gun owners? 

It's a great illustration of the risk of gun ownership, a single incident of anger, or depression, can cost a life if you have access to a lethel weapon.  I'm not saying that disqualifies people from ownership, just a statement of fact about the risk of owning a gun.    If it helps, I tell a similar story to people looking to own a pitbull - that you are making a choice that involves a very real risk."
"Let's be really clear, here:  these monuments are monuments to Jim Crow, the period in which they were erected, with the message of subjugation to Blacks.

Do you really think that message should be perpetuated in front of courthouses in the United States?  Because that's what the fascists are fighting for."
Hillary received vocal support from the racist Congressional Black Caucus.
"If blacks in America were disturbed by the KKK support of the Trump campaign, why did so many not get off their couches to vote on November 8?"
"And Hillary is pro-family and pro-life??
The huge majority of women and blacks employed by trump contest that he is not a sexist  or a racist."
"Au contraire, you have improperly inferred I'm black.  Mote.  Beam.  To AGAIN paraphrase the wisdom of the great Sidney Poitier: ""ASSUME just makes an A$$ of U, not ME.""

However, if I were black, the clearest indication I'm NOT a slave would be that I dismiss with contempt your arrogant attempts to tell me how to think.

And I NEVER 'play the victim'.  Being a victim is never ""play"".  I strive to keep myself and my family from BECOMING victims.

Being a ""victim"" means answering the door some night and being greeted by a uniformed creep who tries to keep the smirk off his face while he informs you one of your kids won't be coming home.  Does that sound like 'play' to you?

And I'll have to work on my gag-reflex before I try to read anything ghost-written for ""CunningLingui$t $pice.""  Thanks anyway."
"And you rely on being black to explain all failures.

You accept no personal responsibility and insist all blacks are the same.

Fortunately, I know many blacks who are and have been successful without needing a crutch like affirmative action so I know that it is just you who feel inadequate."
"He was clearly another Black Rifle lunatic.   Anyone that owns a Black Rifle is a serious threat to the Police and the General Public.

All Black Rifles need to be confiscated and destroyed, in order to protect law enforcement.

Please turn in all of your rifles to the police, so that this never happens to you."
"No one is 'forcing"" this bigoted baker to do anything. He can be hateful towards gays, jews, blacks and women all he likes in his personal life. He can believe anything he wants about groups the disagrees even though it's highly irrational.
But what when he avails himself to the public marketplace he should either abide by the proscribed rules or quit. There is nothing that says baking cakes is practicing religion and nothing about the law that he violated that requires him to believe anything.

I think something that isn't explored is that 99% of those who claim this religions exemption only target one group - homosexuals. They never target adultery or other sins that the bible talks about. This to me shows that it's not really about religion at all."
are these players protesting against Trump or the way blacks are treated in America.
What you fail to realize is that Donald Trump has hired and cut paychecks to more black latino gay lesbian and transgendered people than all previous presidents put together.
"By all means, feel free to invite illegal immigrants to stay in your home, and be sure to give them your social security number too so they can illegally obtain jobs at the expense of unemployed American citizens, many of whom are black, by the way.  How is favoring one ethnic group at the expense of another not a racist position to take?  And your tax information is also misleading as it only accounts for state and local taxes, and not federal.  A disproportionately high number of illegals probably live in high tax CA, and that statistic conveniently makes no mention of the flip side of the coin - how much the states spend on services directly and indirectly linked to their illegal populations."
"I never said they were never in Colorado.  I said they are no longer here and haven't been in 50 years (it's actually 38 since the last one but them being here in significant numbers goes back to the 1950s).  So you seem to read poorly and seem to forget that it was you who claimed that this guy hit a grizzly bear.  You don't know much about Colorado wildlife.  Probably couldn't tell an elk from a deer from a moose from an antelope.  And doubtful you've ever seen a black bear in the wild.  It's been proven that this driver was an idiot and there is no way he and other members of his family should have died from hitting a black bear.  So basically, you have no point and are being nothing but a troll who is hoping to find some sort of validity.  I sure hope you don't drive."
"No one is rewriting history, Bill. The history is still there, even if the monuments to Jim Crow are in some museum out of the sight of a public including black people whose grandfathers were lynched during the Jim Crow troubles."
"""Bumbling"" is the perfect adjective to describe Mantashe.  A bumbling bumble bee...put him in a yellow and black striped top and he'll buzz away without making a grain of sense, smelling the flowers without seeing the tsunami coming."
"You aren't addressing the issues raised by the ""brown"" people in the videos. Are they ""crazies"" too? Are they ""alt-right"" for feeling threatened by the religious extremists who are ""muscling their way"" into their schools, institutions, etc., for resenting the religious hostility their kids received from other kids?  Are they lying?

Re.: M-103. It is a motion to start a process which would ultimately involve ""the whole government"" in making it dangerous to criticize one particular religion. It is NOT innocuous.

BTW, Hindus are not one of the ""People of the Book"" who may get some grudging respect."
"Also, if you take out inner city gun violence (i.e. young black males shooting young black males) The statistics are very surprising indeed... take a minute and look it up"
Maybe not but we now know the anti-war protesters were simply using Russian propaganda as their main arguments. Black Lives Mater is is a violent racist group that has created a false narrative and calls for killing cops. If the owners of NFL teams will allow their players to support that cause they are just as culpable
"""And don't worry, my standards are the same for everyone.""

And yet you use the derogatory terms ""thumpers"" and ""holy rollers"" for Christians. I guess I dont want to hear what you call Muslims or gays or blacks or women if your standards are truly the same."
LOL Don't you know that Chief Saunders and the Mayor and the media want us to believe that that the majority of the violent crime isn't coming from the black community. Shhh... it's a secret that we're supposed to be blind to even though they are actually COLLUDING to show us how the black community are total angels! Of course when you are like me and live in the black community where it isn't safe to go out after dark and get woken up regularly to the sounds of them shooting at each other and even SEE them shooting at each other  AND you go to stores to see them shop lifting AND AND AND...  it's NOT really happening . Don't see the man behind the curtain pushing buttons cause he's not there!!!!! Tired of the excuses and bull Saunders and Tory spew out - they could fix the problem but they don't so excuse me if I give them the contempt they deserve!
"I just clicked yes to comments I admittedly didn't read. One was a reference to Madaonna giving oral sex which I have to admit I was shocked to learn. I thought she was a well mannered nice girl, by I digress.

I then received a black warning notice stating if I keep approving comments that were not deemed civil I would have my access cut off."
"So the City and Colorado should ask themselves why blacks hold so many key government positions?...You must love Nascar, Jesus, and that Confederate flag. Enjoy retirement."
"Trump frequently does make racist statements, about the former president, his wife, an hispanic judge, his tenants, the list goes on and on. Only willful ignorance prevents you from seeing this."
"Actually, I have been to two of those I mentioned.  Not a great idea, just necessary at the time.  

One of my fondest memories is telling a story to a black soldier friend about Major Tom Egan being in Oakland after dark and his response: 

""Man!  Black people that don't live there don't go into Oakland after dark!""  ""What was that fool thinkin'?!"
"It disappointing that the council stepped back from doing what's right, and instead let themselves be led by fear and stupidity. People love to pull out the Constitution when they want to oppose things, but this was not a constitutional issue, just like the state legalizing marijuana use is not. It was the city deciding to step up and say no to hate and prejudice. 

People were talking about safety issues regarding 'those' immigrants. But the thing is, voices of fear and prejudice said the same thing about the Irish, the Jews, the Italians, the Chinese, the Japanese, against African Americans, ... the list goes on.  Langley now can go on record of supporting more madness from King Donald, the man who brought back the monarchy to the our nation."
"""Trump should listen..."" are you guys living in reality? Have you been asleep for the last two years? Trump should LISTEN?! That's rich! The man won't listen and he'll go right on showing his contempt for liberal democracy. He represents psychopaths who want to stick it to the blacks, stick it to the liberals, stick it to cities, stick it to women, stick it planetary environmental health, stick it to equality, stick it to human decency, stick it to progress, stick it to integrity, stick it to reason itself. He is the cresting wave of our profound national social malaise:  pathology and avarice now rule society and government in tyranny, with fear, division, a platform of gaslighting, subversion of The People's duties, PsyOps perpetuated against The People, and a perverse commitment to profound farce and falseness as they despoil all. Take him out of office? Then you've got that zealous psychopath, Pence. Out of frying pan, into fire."
"It’s the shaming of police officers plain and simple, to  suggest they can come but not in uniform  is grossly insulting.
This is what they do, police large events and ensure  safety for all.  Like a fireman the uniform serves many uses, t-shirts and jeans are useless.
This is particularly troubling given the  struggle gay officers went through internally back in the day .They more than anybody  have the rite to ware their hard fought uniform with PRIDE !!!!
Perhaps if Black Lives Matter cares so much about fighting for civil liberty's they should go ware they are needed  rather than invading the gay pride parade."
"Yes, really. It's no secret that Hitler and the Nazis scapegoated Jews, created propaganda about Jews and capitalized on anti-Semitic sentiment that had existed for generations. Trump has taken the same road with ""illegals"", particularly Mexicans, whom he labeled criminals and ""rapists"". And in Trump's campaign, this ill-will extended to all people of color, including American citizens. Hello, he was endorsed by the KKK."
"From what I saw on the video......this career criminal and sex offender with a record as long as anyone's arm.....was resisting the officers. He had a gun he was trying to pull out and when the officers realized that, they told him to stop but he kept on making the effort to pull out the gun. Anyone in that situation, officers or not, would have shot the guy. It funny that if this was about two black officers and dead black criminal.....there would be no hoopla over this incident.

Actually, I read on Yahoo that they did recovered the gun Mr. Sterling was trying to use. And also.....one of his sex offenses was against a child.  This guy wasn't no Baptist minister on his way to church but a career criminal refusing to obey a lawful orders given by a law enforcement officers."
"Who could forget that video. It might have been that black folks, with all they've been through, could hope that modern technology would at last give them a fighting chance in these deadly confrontations: surely, if you could catch it all with a camera... but no, not even that's enough. Apparently all a trigger-happy cop has to do in court is indicate he felt threatened and express his remorse. But that poor woman in the bloodied car, somehow doing everything right, her little girl there too, her law-abiding boyfriend blown away by a panicky officer of the law... that's some officer, some law, some country."
"While I agree that thoughts 140 characters at a time, or criticism and cynicism, are the current state of affairs, I see the difference as noted by Thomas Freedman of wall vs web people as a real difference. And a real separating between the cave and community, between empathy and anger...yes all lives should matter but blacks lives don't matter enough to too many....and blue lives matter but SWAT teams are not good policing -- they are a sign of failure. Is that too critical? Once I realized that criticism is the lowest form of analysis, like puns are the lowest form of humor, I came to appreciate that all things are messy, all people a bit silly, and this is part of being human. It helps...I miss Bloom County. Bill the Cat would have been a perfect running mate for the little 'd.'"
"You must be a Republican.  Swirling black hole where your heart should be ... Hatriotism!!  Praying hard to the money gods while calling yourself a Christian, but we all know by now today's Christian is a 'christian'.  Super fakey!"
"Wrong-winger bigots and racists aren't about to yield one iota of credit to our classy President Barack Obama for saving our nation from going over the Republicants fiscal cliff.  That's ok, we don't need their support or approval. And if you think anti-Obama haters hate him for doing all the things that he accomplished, think again.  They hate him because he's black. Period.  We've witnessed their bigot/racist comments about President Obama on a weekly basis."

"Criticize Obama, the left says you're racist. Criticize Clinton, the left says you're sexist. The left criticizes Carson, they're concerned about his qualifications. The left criticizes Palin, they're concerned about her ignorance. I don't first think those who disagree with Carson do so because he is black, as most who disagree with Obama don't do so because he is black. Let's keep that in mind for the future. I'm concerned about the Trumpster's experience to be Prez and the same about Carson and his role at HUD. I am hopeful that their experience and gut instincts will bust through establishment politics and bureaucracy for the better of all. Sorry Palin fans, I'm sure most people are concerned about her ignorance not her sex. So, let's stop the race, homophobe, sexist bull because that is not what drives the vast majority of ideological differences. Throwing out that junk indicates your inability to engage in civil discourse and explain your ideology. We shall see."

I guess that could be part of the problem, as I had no idea I was owning and regulating businesses 1000 miles away. Help me out here. Do I own any businesses in China or any other far-flung places. I guess we should allow businesses to pollute as much as they want, too, just like when I was a kid and the U.S. was a cesspool/garbage dump. Of course, back then women and blacks knew their place, so there was that."
"Thank you for being as close as I've seen to admitting the Democrats were responsible for both the slavery of the past, and the present destruction of the black family structure by making them dependent on social programs. But you failed to mention the Democrat educational policies that insure many blacks will never escape poverty by making it impossible for them to opt out of the inner city hell holes that pass for schools, as well as supporting the war on police that currently is causing black on black murders to skyrocket in places like Chicago. Anyone who is against these things should never vote for a Democrat, ever, even if this puts you in Hillary's imaginary ""basket of deplorables."" I consider her scorn high praise since she cannot even fathom the real reasons so many millions of people will never vote for her no matter who they have to vote for instead."
"Kneeling during the presentation of the flag and the continuation of employing criminals is why I will not watch the National football League.  But people need to get it straight,  the National Anthem is and always was a pro USA song written during pro slavery time when black people were thought to be sub human. The song we hear today is missing the very slandering verse 3 which is a tribute to more deaths of black people who chose to fight with the British for a chance at freedom.  Britain was not a free nation either but it was their ploy to gain fighters on our land. So do not blame black people for hating the National Anthem.  The current kneeling protest is bad timing and ignorant. The resolution of protesting the National Anthem should have come in a different format. But the ignorance of people saying it's not racist and the ignorance of people singing the song are 2 very showing tales of a laziness to learn. 
Thank you for reading my post."

"Actually that's not my premise. The police are within their jurisdiction to approach ""sketchy"" individuals in a high crime area (or any area for that matter) and ask questions. The individuals have a right to provide a limited answer, or not to answer at all. They have the right not to show their I.D. Any further attempt to detain is a violation of Section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights & Freedoms. Police already have jurisdiction to pull over any moving vehicle for whatever reason they want. Technically it should only be when ""a constellation of objectively discernible facts...give the detaining officer reasonable cause to suspect that the detainee is criminally implicated in the activity under investigation,"" (sect. 9), not just ""I'm looking for a black perp and hey, you're black."" Keep in mind there is zero evidence that carding prevents or reduces crime, or leads to solving more crimes. Toronto Police could provide no evidence when asked by the Province."
You mean like Toronto cops don't arbitrarily card black and brown people?
"I've been watching the proceedings and am amazed that all the black politicians are against him and all the black civilians that have worked with the senator are supporting him.

I'll let you make that call."
"I wouldn't attend the rally as I don't agree with views but shutting it down while proclaiming to stand for free speech and diversity of opinions on account of disavowing hate speech after inviting BLMTO to their campus requires a heavy dose of cognitive dissonance. I'm sure someone will try to argue that BLM isn't racist but the rhetoric I've heard from them says otherwise. Let BLM speak and let others do the same. If you want to combat racism, don't silence it...debate it. At the very least, don't silence others for disagreeing with you while simultaneously accusing THEM of being fascistic. Pot calling the kettle black, no?"

"Just as one example, banks are an institution.  Many banks such as Wells Fargo targeted black people for their b.s. subprime loans before the real estate bubble popped in 2008.  There is documentation that bank employees were instructed to tell black people that there were no fixed rate mortgages (even though they did exist), in order to screw them.  Institutionalized racism."

"I think you're right, but it has never made sense to me to seperate the nationality of a child from that of their parents.  Or, for that matter why the location of your birth would decide your nationality.   

I believe the original intent was intended to protect slaves, (taken by force from their home) and their children from being force to be 'sent home'' to a nation they had resided in but would not know in the present.. Being as the parents had no 'choice' to be slaves, the amendment makes sense, for that time.

"Actually, I agree that Trump has to respond to the growing movement to de-legitimize his presidency.  But to do that Trump needs to respond like a future President of the United States of America.

tweeting out an insult and a lie that a former civil rights fighter is not doing anything for black people in America is just not an adult response.  And if Trump can't refrain from taking bait and can't comport himself like an adult, he should have others speak for him - as Pence seems to be doing today.

Also - what's SMH?"
Talk about kettle and black !!!!! The listhping beast from the northeast makes the minnesota milkmaid look chic !
"""Vicious attack""? I thought you were being sarcastic, Vet. It's about as peaceful a protest as you can have. Your anger isn't stupid, but it is misplaced. Athletes are not attacking ""our nation"" (although that is what Trump wants you to think) any more than Rosa Parks was protesting public transportation or the Selma marchers were protesting bridges. Black Americans are simply done with tolerating police acting like an occupation force toward them. Done with innocent men and boys being murdered. They wisely chose a very big stage to get our attention. As one vet to another, you should be honored for your sacrifice to your country, but you might try to hear what the NFL players are saying with their protest rather than swallow the ""attacking our country"" ruse. Your anger should be aimed at injustice and inequality, not their protest."

In the last few weeks he has led various protests..: BLM; Portland Police contract negotiations.protestors wanted say in contract language; Marches, resulting in 1 million in damages to property and a burden on the public safety budget.., yesterday he met with the Mayor agreed to organized gathering but no marching. Lost control of the mob and they were off and at it again. This is now a gathering of themes, the election, lgbt rights, homeless, anarchists, BLM. Pretty much the kitchen sink. Now the Genie is out of the bottle,  the base is expanding to high school and junior high age kids who are excited and want to be a part of the energy.The professionals sometimes lead, sometimes consult but teach ""noise"".

"Really?  Because at the end of the day, do you really care who is volunteering to pick up a weapon and defend your country against an enemy?

You call trans people serving in the military a ""social experiment""?  So what was it called when these generals used to be against blacks joining the military?  Or women?  Or gays?  How is this any different from any of those groups being denied to serve - or only being allowed to serve in limited capacities?"
"I am very sympathetic to this woman's basic gripe -- I lived for many years in Thailand, and constantly engaging with people's stereotyped idea of what you should look like, how you should behave, what you should think, is annoying.  To have to do that in your native land and culture would be massively aggravating.

However, I think a lot of the problem here is that 'race' is a weird mixture of biology, cultural myth, and habit.  Biologically, it doesn't exist; socially, it does, and socially, being 'black' is one of the more charged identities.  My children, for example, are part American Mennonite and part Asian -- they'll get to work out what this means for them on their own, and the people they interact with will have minimal expectations.

As for the writer, what does she expect?  'Black' after all, is a visual identification; some people will depend on that, including some black people.  Many ethnic identities have certain signifiers, that some people meet easily, others not."

However I will say that being outspoken shouldn't equal a bullet.  If all folks had to worry about was a beat down from the police than there wouldn't be a movement.  Currently America is in what I like to call the trigger happy Wild West trend.  If we as Americans went back to beating each other up rather than shooting one another it might be a different story were reading.

Evil shows itself forward from inside a person through how they are willing to treat or ignore other people when they could be a voice to help them.  We are called to stand up as Christians for equal justice, equal and same treatment, including equal ordination criteria, as a matter of upholding equal and same human dignity, despite what it may cost us for doing so.  When we are not willing to do that because we want what we want more than we care about others then we show ourselves not fit for any leadership role in the church. 

All the evidence is clear.  Originally, the bishops were considering ordaining women deacons when they started ordaining male permanent deacons.  None of the male deacons spoke up for their wives or their sisters so we have none."

Further, Hillary Clinton has been involved in arming terrorists.

She was involved in the CIA/State (Amb. Stevens) program to ship weapons from Benghazi to Turkey for the Syrian “rebels” (the REAL Benghazi scandal, read Seymour Hersh’s ‘The Red Line and the Rat Line’). She also led the push to arm jihadist “rebels” in Libya, including al-Qaeda, who used Her guns to kill innocent men / women and to perpetrate “The Black Libyan Genocide.”

HILLARY CLINTON, ‘SMART POWER’ AND A DICTATOR’S FALL

https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/us/politics/hillary-clinton-libya.html

Libya’s descent into chaos began with a rushed decision to go to war, made in what one top official called a “shadow of uncertainty” as to Colonel Qaddafi’s intentions. The mission inexorably evolved even as Mrs. Clinton foresaw some of the hazards of toppling another Middle Eastern strongman. SHE PRESSED FOR A SECRET AMERICAN PROGRAM THAT SUPPLIED ARMS TO REBEL MILITIAS, AN EFFORT NEVER BEFORE CONFIRMED."
"Hello Dante,

Um, no.

The sentence: ""He voiced support for business owners who choose not to serve gay and lesbian clients""...

... um, no, that sentence emphatically does NOT accurately reflect his quoted statement.

His quoted statement could be paraphrased as: ""He has voiced support boycotting businesses seen by opponents as promoting a gay agenda in advertising"".

That is NOT the same thing as only saying ""voicing support for business owners who choose not to serve gay and lesbian clients"", which implies that folks are not allowed in the store and are refused service if they do walk in, along the lines of black segregation decades ago.

This is a matter of clarity in journalism, not a matter of interpreting the Bible. You are conflating matters."
"Not the same thing at all.  You are dealing here with commercial entities trying to protect what they view as intellectual property they created.  Disney is not taking a stand to defend from appropriation all of western culture, just that darned black rat.  The French government or its commercial agents do not stop you from using the ""method champagnoise"" to make bubbly wine.  (or the shape of the bottles or the colour of the labels).  As a commercial and sourcing matter they ask you not call it champagne.  (The folks who own and run the ""Olympic movement"" are vile and corrupt - feel free to have at them).  You would do better here to compare the collective  defense of a particular set of views about shared symbols (the Bible, the cross, etc...) to the Catholic church's (far more violent of course) reaction to the Reformation.  Remember that the Catholic church lost.  (And yes that is not a perfect case for comparison, but no worse than yours)."

*Companies seek employees with skills and knowledge, color does not matter but the skills and knowledge do matter.

*Those with major criminal convictions carry an added risk.  Embezzle from one company, odds lean heavily this employee will embezzle from the next one, for example. 

*Be a convicted sexual predator, and school districts will not hire them. Schools are predominately Democrat.

*Be a drug user and odds are no one will hire them to drive a bus. Governments are predominately Democrat.

I bet she was the belle of the ball with her other friends that likely let her win the costume contest.  My reaction to racism is not part of the problem in the least - the problem is racism, subtle or blatant.  My inability to forgive racist behavior comes from so many ""self-serving"" obligatory apologies, saying she didn't mean to offend anyone and was just (fill in stupid and silly excuse for racism here).  As for judge and jury, her employer is the one threatening her livelihood, not me.  Your anger and ire should be directed toward them, not to an American that finds her behavior offensive.  I bet people like you made excuses for slavery, Jim Crow and still mock Black Lives Matter for wanting police to stop killing them a such an alarming rate.

"I think you believe that about secularists (whoever the heck they are) because you define ""diversity"" as including (or even celebrating) those who would discriminate against others based on some quality.  For example, when we are commenting on the cake bakers and the gay couple, you (or your identity at the time) wrote that you would be fine with a shop keeper discriminating against Christians or gays or Jews or blacks or whoever because, you know, freedom and honoring diversity.

"I'm sure you're a lovely person. I am too. But this is not about individuals in the present. Let me come at this by example. My great grandparents arrived from Germany, got farm land on the cheap, worked their butts off and made a healthy nest egg that got passed down to my grandparents. They, in turn, got more land on the cheap, and then benefitted handsomely from a federal government that assisted them through the depression of the 30s. My parents then went to college on subsidized loans, got public jobs, and built even more wealth bc the banks were nice enough to keep blacks out of the neighborhood. What all this means is that I stand to inherit a pile of money. Now look at my friend Warren, a black guy whose ancestors were just as hard working as mine. But his great grandparents were slaves, and after emancipation they were basically indentured servants. Local sheriff kept them from voting. His father served in WWII, but was prohibited from getting a mortgage. More after the jump."

"This is only yet one more glaring example of how the state of academic discourse at universities in Canada is a complete farce. People running universities all across the land ought to be ashamed of themselves. I just finished watching video footage of that hard core racist Yusra Khogali hurling racial slurs at a black man on the U of T campus at freedom of speech rally. Universities are dangerous places when prominent members of their student political bodies are allowed to run around the campus oppressing members of minority groups with blatant hate speech and university administrators do nothing about it. A clear human rights violation, on a university campus yet administrators turn a blind eye? No, somethings wrong in the world of academia and the people running that fiasco have no business in trying to form solutions to it. They'll make their safe spaces but make no mistake. At the university of Toronto, that black man who was clearly a victim of a hate crime, should not feel safe"

"It was only a matter of time before endless terrorist attacks by Islamic extremists produced a backlash from the extreme right. But the hate is not confined to these two groups.

These are the same extremists who dress in black and trash stores in opposition to globalisation. 
Every sector of society has its extremists. It is up to us all to speak out when we see hate, whether it is from the extreme right or the extreme left, whether it is the promotion of hatred in a mosque or any place of worship. 
More and more people are being dragged into this circle of violence. The only thing necessary for evil to triumph is for good men (and women) to do nothing."

"I was placed in a Presbyterian boarding school in Ganado AZ 1n 1955 (6th grade) I look primarily Anglo, but that didn't mean I got any better treatment. 

The school decided to have a Navajo Christmas Nativity/play. I was devastated to hear some of my Navajo classmates react with disgust ""I'm not going to dress up like a ""john"" (Similar to Ni**er for a black person) How could some of them turn their back on their heritage, their history and their people??

The Presbyterian teachers at that school were better than most at trying to give us the ability to exist in both worlds. Very little of the ""rejection attitude"" came from there.

Sixty years later, it is gratifying to note that almost all students from that school became the ""Movers & Shakers"" in Tribal Gov't and leaders in their communities and professions.

Yes, the abuse in most of the (particularly gov't) ""Indian"" schools was terrible, and unforgivable - but like many bad situations, there were a few silver linings."
"The Republican Party, supposedly, is a Christian supporting Party. How does it criticize a woman who remains married (you do understand ""for better or for worse?"", I hope) and loyal to her husband---- as opposed to a serial liar, multiple-married cheater? 
We are not electing Bill C, though his approval ratings are higher than Reagan's. 
Where was the outrage about Hillary's comments before yesterday? It is all posturing. How could you and Trump supporters remain behind him if you really cared about women? Sorry, but timing is all. For the past year, his attacks on women, all Muslims, American servicemen, Latinos, and others has been just fine with you. 
Saying nasty things about women who attack one's spouse hardly equates with sexually assaulting women, as Trump admitted to doing. 
It takes a very strange person to overlook a lifetime of action. Hillary: helping her fellow Americans her whole life. Trump? Helping himself for his entire life thanks to a rich Daddy."

"""A freshman legislator in the Alaska House of Representatives has demonstrated to this fallibility by pushing his hate-based agenda since taking office – against black Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and Alaskan women, so far. While some of his behavior since taking office has caused some concern, most of us can agree that he crossed a line this week when he verbally abused the women of Alaska, specifically targeting our sisters who live in village and rural Alaska.""

Hold on a second... pushing a ""hate-based agenda"" that disparages ""black Alaskans, Alaska Natives, and Alaskan women"" causes ""some concern"" to the authors of this op-ed, but he only ""crossed the line"" after ""he verbally abused the women of Alaska""? 

For the record, I believe Rep. Eastman's comments were shameful. This, however, is the worst possible response I could have imagined."

"Why should the gay men of Toronto want anything to do with Pride anymore? Bit by bit, year after year,  Gay Pride was taken away from us.   Now it has been stolen by  BLM and turned into this farce.   As a gay man, I have no link to events anymore. Corporate sponsorship will be next to go . If Pride folds, so be it.  We gay guys created Gay Pride 35 years ago and we can create something else to replace it.  Cops in uniform welcome."
"The truth is that black men make up less than 7% of the population but account for over 50% of violent crime. If black men are being shot at a higher percentage than other groups (which FBI stats seem to refute) perhaps it's due to such a small population committing a disproportionate number of violent crime?  Blacks are killing one another by the hundreds in Chicago, New Orleans, Detroit,  Cleveland, etc but not a word of protest from any of the cowards in the NFL or Hollywood who are so concerned for poor black people."

Purge all scientists from all departments to be left empty to accomplish the same thing.  Time for a Revolution."

Falwell supported the Apartheid Government,  had his minions appear on TBN with Jan and Paul Crouch to mean mouth Desmond Tutu.  They insisted that the black community of South Africa liked the way things were running.......even when their families were separated,  jailed, tortured and killed.  Of course, this was all past on to Jerry Prevo of the Anchorage Baptist Temple.  I was there when Prevo sent two of his supporters to the picket line dressed as devils with signs that read, ""This is my kind of crowd, I hate Dr. Prevo.""   He was publicly busted but minimized what his real intentions were."

- women
- Jewish folks

- black folks
- Japanese people
- folks from India
- folks from Pakistan
- natives
- Italians
- Irish folks
- transgender people

"Between your comments and the garbage this woman is spewing the Hawaiian community should wake up and start coming together as one so their legitimate concerns can be addressed.  A lot of what I hear coming from the current parties is akin to the blacks saying they should be funded by the government because their ancestors of many generations ago were slaves.  What language would you rather be speaking now if the U.S had not taken over, albeit illegally.  To think these islands would have been able to protect themselves from any other country trying to take them over is ridiculous.  If any Hawaiian is still alive that was here before 1893, I would love to hear what they have to say!"

How low the GOP has sunk. The GOP is now the George Wallace party. The GOP is now the party of anti-black segregation. Is it any wonder why 95 percent of black Americans don't vote Republican? Every chance Republican voters get, you keep demonstrating to black Americans that they aren't welcome in your party or, given your choice for president, in your neighborhood. When you vote for an anti-black segregationist, you can't even pretend to respect black Americans anymore so stop saying ""respectfully"". You don't mean it. Racist segregationist party elects a racist segregationist. Doesn't sound very ""respectful"" to me."

"So much here to think about.   I'd like to highlight something near the end of the article: 

Fr. Reese ends the article noting that this particular issue seems to fall through the cracks when various advocacy groups look past their agreements and focus on their disagreements. THAT, IMHO, may well be the problem of the day in our society.  If one is a conservative, liberal, libertarian, Catholic, Black, Muslim, Jew, millennial or boomer, that's all we need to know about that person.  We stop there, discussion over.  The end result, we ALL tend to be fed a steady diet of fear.  No wonder so many in the Western world fear Islam.  With all this fear OF Islam, that same fear stokes liberals who fear rights will be pulled back instead of expanded, fueling conservatives who fear that liberals are giving away or spending our future, fueling even more fear that begets more fear....

These problems are VERY real.  I think Fr. Reese has it right.  The fix is to focus ad develop what we agree on."

4 - That BLM is funded heavily by George Soros, who only cares about Globalism and destabilizing Western governments. 
5 - That race related crimes are way down from 40 year ago."

Not to mention the fact that black Americans are angrier now than when Obama took office......shouldn't he have helped race relations instead of moving them backwards?"

"I an appreciate that it had nothing to do with the military - but that's the point. He decried, as you quoted, ""... a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color"" - it's that flag of ""oppression"" that gave him the ability to make such a protest without government sanction - many many places in the world he would've been imprisoned yet he, in his 'oppressed' state, has the freedom to do what he did... AND whether he likes it or not - it is the US military that fights for that flag and his 'oppressed' self to have that freedom.

He addresses the ""Shut up and play"" demands of fans. We like our sports figures to be one dimensional. They have nothing beyond their prowess. Fans are shocked when they have the gall to protest anything. From the Olympics, to football and basketball, we want athletes to stay in their place. After a number of killings by police of unarmed black men, THESE black men chose to not remain silent. Their teammates - brothers in battle - supported them, even if disagreeing.

"Given the consequences of modernist views of sex --- the breakdown of the family; the unprecedented divorce rate; marriages that were until now unheard of; sexual self-mutilation; fatherless homes that are ruinous to all, but especially ruinous to the black population in America; the abortion of 1.6 million babies in the United States alone; the born-out-of-wedlock birth rate zooming --- I'd say that modernity would be wise to retain some of the views of the middle ages when it comes to sex."
"This debate could have been held in a less provocative way, and I'd be okay with it.  I'm perfectly okay with what you say there, although I wonder what this protest means for black Americans, and that is cause for concern.  There is a kind of racism that isn't 'back of the bus' racism, but there are overtones of it all the same.  We'll see whether this is the beginning of something more serious or not."
"It would be interesting to see if more progress would be made if the protest was framed as ""cops harm/shoot/kill too many citizens"" rather than ""cops harm/shoot/kill too may African-Americans"".

No doubt the problem is worse for African-Americans.  But it's a problem for other groups too (particularly men of all races).  If it wasn't framed so much as a racial thing, I think it would attract far more support.  And the benefits would still flow disproportionately to African-Americans.

I think it is an unfortunate commentary that people are unwilling to stand up to anti-black racism.  But from a purely tactical point of view, I think downplaying race would result in more progress on the issue."

"Maggie's permitted to air her solidly left-wing view of Obama and we who differ with her on that view are free to dismiss it as a broken-hearted lullaby, to plagiarize  Sassy Sarah Vaughan. It was good that America elected a black president. He was, however, a disaster in foreign policy, a pushover who paved the way for the kickback that brought us the even more disastrous Donald Trump and his fellow-thug Putin. Obama was well qualified on domestic issues, an inner-city fixer, but as incompetent on the world stage as  Ike, who, like Barrack, simply invited bullies to swing away. As a bulwark against bullies, you have to have credibility and Obama's red lines left us all simply red-faced when adversaries laughed at and ignored them.  It was nice that he had class. It would be nice if Trump wasn't the lowest of low-brow. But you don't bring just class to a gunfight."

"Companion Brand, made in Taiwan, offers more than 40 vegan/vegetarian products. They can be had from most Asian markets. Very delicious and, to my recollection, inexpensive. If you haven't made a trip to a Ranch 99 market
in an Asian area and shopped for vegetarian food, you should.

Dr.Harry Miller had a hand in developing what are now marketed in Asia as local soy milks. Thailand has some very delicious drinks that are packaged for long shelf lives and require no refrigeration. One Thai brand has a black sesame flavor that is especially good. I wouldn't be surprised if SDA also had a hand in developing meat analogs in Asia that are now being sold as ""Asian.""


What these vege products need is a good marketing campaign. Garden Burger spent an entire years advertising budget on a single ad during the super bowl. Must have paid off if they were acquired by Kellogg's. Not sure how ""Silk"" soymilk is doing in the States now but it was going good for a while about 13 years ago"

Or the woman in Mississauga who demanded to be fully covered from head to toe in black, in public, because of her 'religious' beliefs. She went to the courts to be allowed to stay in her dark cave of thinking and culture.

This is what is being allowed to immigrate into Canada, and will gradually shape the policies of Canada."
"Precisely the point, Trump is pitching this ridiculous standard established by the Obama and his ilk that made sure in PC fashion, that every photo had at least one Asian, African American, Woman ....and the list goes on REGARDLESS of qualification.

It's more popular in Hollywood than Crossfit and cocaine together. Politicians gleefully declare gun free (AKA certain death) zones and pass magazine bans based on the whims of their monied anti gun masters, while being protected by arsenals that are the envy of some third world nations. Being a black gun owner in the modern age must be like wearing a bullseye on both side of your body every day."
"Did you mean that the old flag was meant to be a racist symbol? If so you'd best brush up on history as that flag predates apartheid by 20 years. In fact black South African soldiers fought the nazis under that very flag in the deserts of Egypt during world war 2. It has become associated with apartheid in the recent past but was never conceived as ""an apartheid symbol"". The afrikaner nationalists actually hated it when it was first introduced in 1928 because it featured the hated union flag of the British. That said I do believe that it really has no place being displayed in any public space outside of a museum due to the aforementioned modern association with apartheid."
"It happens to black professionals, too - for no other reason than the colour of their skin. Ask Toronto Star journalist Desmond Cole. Maybe even read his article ""The Skin I’m In: I’ve been interrogated by police more than 50 times—all because I’m black""

... is more than 50 percent higher than the number of black folks in the USA. Indeed, Hispanic and Asian folks are close to double the numbers of black folks.

"Trump throw the red meat to his base, vile them up, elicit response from everyone else is exactly where he wants things to be.  The divider-in-chief has done it again - pitch people against people, make people take side so to strengthen his base and distract his lack of major achievement so far in his presidency.  Personally I can't see how 'kneeling' is offensive, which I feel is a gesture of compassion with a degree of sadness.   Just watch Jackie O kneeled before the coffin of JFK during the funeral, nobody said she was being offensive.  Colin K started this gesture to protest against the police brutality against black, a sad state of affairs.  Agree with him protesting during the anthem or not, by doing so he is making a bigger impact to raise the issue.  Now Trump is making his cause (and kneeling as a form of protest) a lot bigger, perhaps an unintended consequence unforeseen by this destructor."
"MT907 wrote: ""The tired old “racism” charge is getting a played out and isn’t working anymore…the left really needs to work on its creativity.""

With Trump it's a reality though  MT907 - the company his father created and he now runs routinely refused to rent to people of color - so much so that DOJ got involved.  

and I quote:

""The Justice Department undertook its own investigation and, in 1973, sued Trump Management for discriminating against blacks. Both Fred Trump, the company’s chairman, and Donald Trump, its president, were named as defendants. It was front-page news, and for Donald, amounted to his debut in the public eye.""

"Judy, they're""illegal"" because they're breaking the law by being here.  That distinguishes them from immigrants who followed our laws and came here legally.  You can argue semantics and call them undocumented if you like, but it doesn't change the facts.   My grandparents followed the law and immigrated legally, I suspect most people's kin also followed the laws in place at the time as well.  Even yours, most likely.  But Judy, how is it ""social justice"" to reward people that breaks our laws, when millions of others follow the system and have to wait for their chance?  How is it ""social justice"" to allow these people to compete for jobs and government benefits with with American citizens that are struggling to get by?  Where is the justice in that?  And the fact that the citizens being affected in this way are disproportionately black opens you up to charges of racism, although I doubt that's you, you probably just haven't thought it through all the way, preferring emotion to logic."

"Unlikely that you can be enlightened, but perhaps I can attempt it.

The US was founded by men who believed in self government, and the notion that government's role is to serve man, rather than the opposite. One of the ideals of freedom is the right of citizens to peacefully protest injustice.  It's an inalienable right laid out in the Declaration of Independence, and codified in the Constitution. The soldiers who have fought and died in our military did so to support these ideals.  

Perhaps rather than snarling at these men who have chosen to respectfully protest you can take a moment to reflect on their situation, and try to imagine what it would be like to walk in their shoes. Think about a time when a black man couldn't use the same restroom as you, eat at a restaurant or ride in the front of a bus. Think of what it would be like to be sitting in your car as a legal concealed weapon holder, and have a cop shoot you for following the law, purely out of fear of your skin color."
"It's pretty obvious you aren't that close then, let alone ""very close"". That you haven't been invited over should be your clue that maybe the ""close"" relationship you think you have is a one-way street and your ""very close friends"" may think you're an acquaintance at best. Maybe your ""very close friends"" don't really enjoy your company and accordingly do NOT want you in their house. Maybe your ""very close friends"" roll their eyes behind your back when you attempt to use them with this ""Some of My Best Friends Are Black"" routine like you're doing now."
"""Dr. Marrus asked a black Junior Fellow: ""You know this is your master, eh? Do you feel the lash?""""

And the Junior Fellow (JF) should have retorted that 'well, he is your master too and you are going actually going to feel the lash' then and there instead of all this backbiting by all. Since JF did not throw the ball back, it is incumbent on Dr. M to apologise immediately to JF.

Do not know Dr. M from Adam. But  Dr. M must have clearly felt so collegial with JF to have commented in such a manner as Dr. M cannot be so obtuse to speak to a stranger."
"Great fact so had just a little to do about race, just religion, sure the black people who were mostly the target of that group at the time felt better that is was not only about them.  KKK was and is a evil group now and back then, do not discount that to make your point which I am still trying to figure out...."
"So you get to tell black people HOW they should protest?

Do you understand the concept/significance of kneeling?"
"It's worth pointing out that the survey in the Black Experience Project didn't get a random sample of Black Canadians, and it also didn't collect any numbers to compare the responses to. That is, the BEP's report doesn't tell us how Canadians of other ethnicities report their experience of microaggressions; nor does it tell us how Black Canadians' answers to the questions have changed over time.

So the Black Experience Project can collect some interesting qualitative data and highlight perceived problems. In particular, the interview responses can give us a glimpse of *how* racism is felt by Black people to work.

But the BEP can't give us a very clear picture of how widespread racism is, given both the lack of representativeness and the lack of any comparison between groups or over time."
"You're another liberal that no one can tell jack too. So what else is new?
Now tell me how well blacks were treated in the north after the war and more especially during the great migration of blacks from the south to the north in the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's. Interviews with many blacks that moved north stated they wished they'd never left the south because they found the racism and hate was worse in the north as well as they couldn't find jobs because the Yankees wouldn't hire them. They stated at least back home in the south they had something to eat and jobs. Most didn't have the money to move back to their beloved southland after they were lied to by the yankee carpetbaggers."
"Amazing that the Black community lived for 160 years in and around Confederate statues 
and never mentioned them as offensive.Why would they? The Confederacy was about 
secession of states being taxed practically out of existence and then trying to prevent their 
subjugation by an invading army which, by the way, did not have as its goal the freeing of any slaves."
"OH please... They got scared and made up a reason! They racial profiled a black woman driving an expensive fancy car with dark windows and decided to pull her over. When they realized she's the state attorney they came up with ""machine error- we've never seen this before"". Black people have experienced this before and thats a common defensive tactic when cops pull over a black person they had no business bothering... 

Try again..."
"Nobody cares, unfortunately.  Leftists, including at the Globe, are the true elitist racists.  They love blacks as a writing prop, but not as real people."
"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/racism Something else to consider, many of the comments here seem to follow this. If you admit you're a racist it is easier to change it, assuming you want to change. The problems in the black community are the problems of all americans. United we stand and divided we fall, something to think about."
"Indira Gandhi was not related to Mahatma Gandhi. As for being elected due to her family name, that was probably true in her first election in 1967, which she almost lost. The next three elections she fought were on her name. She won two, and lost one.

He father, Jawarharlal Nehru, won all his elections. It was due to him that India was the only Asian/African colony to remain a democracy from the time of independence."

"When you create a narrative, you determine, one way or another, how best to interest the reader in that narrative, what kinds of characters work, and would be realistic. If I feel writing in the voice of a female or a black person is the best way to do things, then that's what I'll choose to do. I want my story realistic after all.  Do I know what it's like to be a female? I mean, as well as an actual female? No. But I can make it seem realistic, and that's what's important. I don't know what it's like to be a soldier or police officer or lawyer or doctor, either, but I can still do research and write realistically."
The Charlotte-Mecklenburg police chief said the victim had a gun which was found at the scene. The officer who shot the victim was a black man. There will no doubt be an outside (federal) investigation. Let's see what comes of it before kneeling and looting eh?

"You don't need to be a climatologist to do research on global warming.  I've been researching it for over 20 years and he is spot on.  We are headed for a world where scarcity of food and water, ecosystem collapse and mass species extinction will be the norm.  As I write this approx. 20 million people are dying of starvation in three countries in the horn of Africa due to drought which brought on famine.  This is real and it's going to get real ugly.  There are climate refugees all over the planet that are having to leave their homelands as they no longer can support communities.   Wake up, folks!  Denial is decreasing our chances of having a decent way of life for humans and all other life on this small planet possible.  ALL of the Academy of Sciences are in agreement that this is happening and human caused. What can we do?  Encourage birth control, living and buying local & organic, call/write your legislators to pass laws where it's mandatory to live sustainably."
"Maybe it would make more sense to stop talking from the lens, from the perspective, of ""some people in society are privileged because of their parents' good childrearing and organizational choices""...

.... and start talking about this instead from the narrative of ""some people in society are being damaged because their parents are making the choice to be badly organized and to use incompetent childrearing approaches"".

See, thing is, in medicine the goal is to correctly identify the DISEASE and then to seek treatment for the DISEASE. Which is to say that it would be kind of useless if medical doctors spent all day long talking about nothing but how well the body works when it is free of disease (and perhaps implying that those out there who have diseases, they ought to be envious and resentful and bitter toward those in good health).

I think there is a profound lesson in that medical vignette for all the social justice warriors out there..."
"I am not defending anyone, I believe that misfortune is averted when all parties who could have prevented a situation in whole or in part assume responsibility for their actions.  I don't know how the sex transpired as in when the young woman blacked out.  Do you?  All we know is that when the witnesses showed up she was passed out.  Have you ever drunk to black out stage?  We simply do not know what transpired between the young man and women before the witnesses showed up.

In my opinion your comments about drugs are completely irrelevant.  

Ask yourself how we are going to prevent this drunk on drunk misadventure.  Are you unrealistically going to say that drunk boys should be lucid and make reasonable decisions when black out level drunk?  That is not going to happen.  Are you also going to say that females can drink out of control and have no responsibility?  Of course, we will get recitals of don't blame the victim.  In drunk on drunk cases, who is the actual victim?"

"Some people will complain regardless of any idea of what it is they are complaining about.  Let's see, Mr. Trump said he had learned something and Mr. Blow rails against him.  What exactly is his issue?
Diversity is divisive.  When I grew up we were told we are all Americans and we bring our history and culture and experience to a Melting Pot of American Culture.  Black America has historically not been recognized and Negro  History Week was begun to educate all of America about many of the contributions to our culture.
All these many years later people have no working knowledge of important people in American History and Black history is taught as though anything a black person accomplishes is special due to their oppression. 
Black America has been strong and vibrant regardless of their historical difficulties.  It is time for Black America to look to that history and ask why they aren't achieving those standards today.  Then again, New York Times columnists know no history."
"Trump is more in touch than the far left and media

Results of the new NPR/PBS Marist poll are pretty surprising for we who have relied on the media to accurately report on the mindset of the country.

•The only group with a majority favoring removal (57 percent) are “Strong Democrats”

Among self-described Moderates, 67 percent favor leaving the statues standing. 

44 percent of African-Americans polled believe in keeping the statues standing. Of Latinos, 65 percent believe the statues should remain."

"Liu Xiaobo is too famous. If he was able to travel abroad his bad treatment in a Chinese jail would be a black eye for the Chinese government. He can and will speak out against China.

Reporters of any stripes will be barred from seeing him. China likes to keep their political dissidents quiet."
"So, who are Hawaii's homeless?  Perhaps mainland homeless scraping up enough for a one-way ticket to paradise's streets.  But, really, they are the born and bred goodly locals who cannot even afford one-way tickets to Las Vegas, California, Oregon, or Washington.  Of course this growing dark population will trend to crime.  Certainly, frustrated politicians will contain them in camps far away from upsetting tourists, schools, businesses, and soccer moms.  Camps will be parceled apart to avoid risk of a competing united society (like prisons) having its own governance, enforcement, and social culture.  While we publicly emote and wail over the homeless plight, we financially ignore this inevitable future as we do global warming.  Instead, we continue relentless risks and zero-sum games like throwing tax dollars at Rail.  We drive up property values and their taxes, export more locals to Vegas, and import rich outsiders to fill vacancies.  We settle on legalizing homeless camps."
"Once, a number of years ago, First National Bank of St. Louis (which exists no more) challenged a shareholder resolution calling on them to stop selling Krugerrands. The resolution noted that South Africa discriminates against blacks in every walk of life and the bank said no, it didn't. The SEC sided with the proponents that, yes, South Africa did discriminate against blacks in every walk of life. This is the same sort of case. Part of the reason for black unemployment is the lack of educational opportunity for blacks. Part of it is the lack of health care. Part of it is the lack of housing and public transportation. But all of these are public policy that buttress societal racism. Unions until recently have been explicitly racist, for example, in their refusal to admit blacks into apprenticeship programs. In short, I think objective assessors like the SEC would agree with my original statement -- and the single piece of evidence I gave you was a paried study, one of many."
"Michael,

Many perceive that restitution is essential to forgiveness, if not a prerequisite, but that is not the scriptural model. God forgives us because we need to be forgiven so that reconciliation can take place and there is no possible way for us to pay Him restitution for what He suffered because of our sins. Sometimes restitution plays an instructive role and is good, but it is not mandatory and in the current social context the demands by Blacks in America to continue receiving benefits and advantages not enjoyed by the rest of society is increasingly being viewed as an odious offense making reconciliation more difficult. Instead of demanding restitution, what if we just loved people and let God's transforming power change them? Doing that takes restitution out of the picture and builds unity in Him as we become citizens of the Kingdom of God."
"And you don't see the clear confound in your analysis?  

OF COURSE the average 80 year old man is healthier than an 80 year old woman, because the unhealthy men died in their 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s and never made it to 80, so the pool of remaining men gets statistically healthier, on average, with each early death.  A five year gap in life expectancy goes right hand in hand with the effect you note."
"Wait a minute, they charged a 71 year old lady with feeding wildlife because a bear got into her trash can? Are you sure? There must be more to that story.
Her trash removal company should have provided her with a bear proof container. That's what happens in Glennallen. If a bear starts showing interest in our trash can we call our local trash company, C B S, and within the blink of an eye they are there replacing it with a new can. I mean, they are right on it, FAST!  
I once watched a black bear return to his favored can only to find it had been replaced by a bear proof one. He got up on top and jumped up and down, tried to pry the lid up, pushed down on it, smacked the sides of the can, and sat down looking at the thing perplexedly Oh man, it was SO HILARIOUS!."
"That person's testimony would be challenged, just as you are doing now, the accused would swear  that it never happened, and everyone could believe who they wanted. Thus the need to encourage people to get proof in the form of a recording.

I am on vacation for the winter I Caif. and read the Toronto news since I live in Toronto born and raised I am a 78 year old gay man  and coming out I the 1960's was living two lives undercover so we would not lose our jobs - families - friends -brothers and sisters etc.   We have paved the way where we stand today  free  accepted and live our own lives the way we choose not the way someone wants us to live as it is our life -  - Canada is my home and best country I the world in my beliefs.  I was appalled that BLM won over Pride Committee giving In like they did - I was disgusted - as many of these kids are just that and know nothing about how we struggled to live our lives over 60 years I can live my life...normally.

ESS: this is true but offers nothing to it's practicality. Not that long ago society's standards also deemed it ok for one man to be the possession of another.

"Ms. Hill, History deniers? REALLY, like climate change deniers. If there are any deniers in all this, they are on the left. The South lost, blacks today in the South, East, West, and the North are free people, because America fought a war to set them free. Those statues represent a period a time in American History. And that period doesn't exist any more, however many want to believe it still does. This is being done as a means of delegitimizing the History in order to rewrite it. The reshaping of America by the left."

"Other significant differences that mitigate against a Mugabe style ""coup"" in South Africa has to do with historical roots.  

1. Zimbabwe has only one major urban conurbation; Harare ( population: 1.5m).  
South Africa has Cape Town (3.7m), Port Elizabeth/George (1.5m), Durban/Pinetown (3.4m), Johannesburg (4.4m), Tshwane (2.9m) and Ekurhuleni (3.2m).   
And 4 of these major South African metro areas are NOT ruled by the SACPanc.

2. The Shonas are dominant and make up 70% of the Zimbabwe population.  In South Africa 23% speak Zulu, 16% Xhosa, 14% Afrikaans and 10% English as their ""home"" language, in total only 63%; this represents a very diverse tribal/cultural landscape, in comparison to Zimbabwe. These tribal/cultural groups are also concentrated along historical lines across 9 provinces (one of which is not ruled by the SACPanc) and the 4 major urban conurbations."
"""Canada must try to lead the world’s response. ""

That seems to be the only reference to Canada leading in the entire article despite the article title of "" African famine should be Canada’s moment to lead""

Most of the article, of course, is slamming Trump and the U.S. for not continuing to provide the bulk of the relief as if there are no other options.

And all of these frequent ""Canada's chance to lead"" or ""Canada should be leading"" are nothing more than a slightly disguised way of self-esteem building. Canada is not doing anything in the particular area being discussed, but it so naturally qualified that its surprising.  But not just participating. Canada is so good that if it did participate, it would be as the leader. This just contributes to a delusional self-image because this theme is repeated for what seems like multiple times a week."

"Keep the statues;  add the context. Add new statues to  honor the  large  numbers were denied their human rights and more than 50% were denied their civil rights.  Some people still are. Change came from hard work, endurance, and putting their life on the line. More change is needed.

Give memorials special consideration. Every person in the war, soldier  and civilian, free or slave, was someone's family. People are not infallible. Honor the dead person; learn from his choices.  Historical figures had imperfect lives. For scientists, it it's easier to honor the science even when the person was not always honorable.

"Glen,

Practical.  Practice.   I had men working in Gary, Ind. who were robbed at lunch time. Mexicans, robbed by Blacks.  The robbers told the Mexicans if they told the police, they would come back and kill them. As we had an obligation to finish the contract, we did the right thing. We shut up and went back to work.

That is practical.  The police couldn't reasonably be expected to protect the men and neither could I their employer.  Neither could the power company we were working for do anything to protect them.  They had to protect themselves.

Obviously, work assignments like this in Gary, Ind. have to be temporary.  Who would want to move in and live there permanently? 

 The answer to all this is the 'shine' girl's answer. ""Me? I am a good child""
Until and unless the robbers repent and reform, their town (fellow man and woman) will suffer under their exploitation.  There are no institutional solutions, apart from the institution of the family."

"Qatar is the key US ally in the Arabian Peninsula & the US has a major base there on which it relies for much of its efforts against ISIL & other like-minded Sunni fundamentalist factions in Syria/Iraq. Turkey, a NATO ally of the US & the US's somewhat unreliable ally on the Syria/Iraq scene, also supports Qatar. Egypt (its domestic stability being key to US regional policy) relies significantly on the remittances by Egyptian nationals who work in Qatar.

It is true that, while Qatar in several ways plays a modernizing & moderating role in the region, it also serves unofficially as a conduit for funds for ISI, but so does Saudi Arabia and its allies in making these demands.

The Saudis made these demands shortly after Trump's visit & the US remains very silent throughout.

Why shouldn't we see all this together as further evidence of confusion & incoherence to a dangerous & destabilizing extent in US Middle East policy, especially whenever Trump becomes directly involved?"

Mosqueda, like Grant, is solidly progressive, as the Weekly freely admits (as does the Stranger).  Therefore, for me, in this context, she is the clear choice. In the Obama era this race would not have been as easy a call, but those days are sadly over for now. Vote Mosqueda for Position 8."

"I think Mr. Card was right on target with the word 'mawkish'--sentimental in a feeble or sickly way. Instead of engaging in a thoughtful discussion with her students about Dr. Tweedy's book she dons an Afro and puts black paint on her hands and face? She WAS being sentimental--patronizingly so to both Tweedy's memoir and especially her Black students experiences of racism. Mawkish captures it all- feeble, sickly, sentimental. Yuk. I don't care if she meant well, seriously, get a clue."

"Maybe if these ""professionals"" found the time to march with BLM (which I don't agree with) or did rides with police officers (I will never refer to them as cops) in places like Chicago, St. Louis, etc., then maybe they will understand what these men and women go through every time they roll.  Disrespecting the flag and anthem is NOT the way to do it.  Until they act like men and stand with their hand over their heart and sing the anthem (presuming they even know the lyrics), I have no use for these wannabes.  I'm waiting for one of them to say, ""You wouldn't understand, its a black thing!"""
"When a developer wants a tax break, they need to be specific.  They also need to quantify the ROI for the taxpayer so a win-win can be reasonably concluded.  There should also be a reconciliation clause that would put the developer on the hook for lost tax revenue if it turns out they exaggerated the benefits.  Do you remember the claims made to gain approval for the construction of the Dena'ina Convention Center including moving the Sportsmans' Show and attracting oodles of national conventions?  We don't hear much about that anymore..."

In this context, more media myth and insult: ""The Apartheid Museum, as a concept, was conceived by Abe and Solly Krok"" Brij Maharaj will have us believe that KPMG/GUPTA captured the state. Kroks, Gold Reef City Casino, in evidence under oath, over a period of 16 years, clearly establish the fact that they pioneered control over ALL THREE SPHERES OF GOVERNMENT.  amaBhungane, among others, are still sitting tight on that PWC/KROK dossier we delivered.

"Again, personal attacks to stifle the discussion because your view is questioned.  But I will check out the black population in CA and WA from 1845 until 1940 and compare it to OR's.  Of course this will require more than just cursory numbers (whatever they may be).  My initial assumption will be that if large black populations are found in this time period it will be in the cities and probably due to a war boom but I could be wrong and that is the fun of research.  Since Oregon only has one city that would could even possibly compare to the defense heavy areas of CA and WA that will also be problematic but it should be interesting."
Now maybe Congress can work together on a bipartisan effort to fix ACA instead of repealing and replacing.  And get rid of Mitch Mcconnell.  He's worked to quash every initiative that Obama promoted the day  Obama became President...even refused to considered Obama's pick for SC vacancy.  Was it because he was black or a had Muslim name?  And thank the 3 repub who used common sense and voted against the repeal.

"Soaring economy is continuation of the trend established under Obama. I'm sure you gave the black guy credit for that like you're giving it all to Trump now, right?

Solutions:

1. Single payer healthcare to bring us up to par with countries results and cost per capita.
2. Tax the wealthy their fair share to reverse the cost-shifting onto the middle class that has happened for the past three decades, thus stimulating the economy by increasing aggregate demand.
3. Policies that allow wage earners to keep more of the profits from their labor, again, aggregate demand, and improvement of social problems that come with poverty.
4. Continue the historic deficit reduction that happened under Obama.
5. Invest in education and infrastructure.
6. Invest in occupational retraining for workers displaced by the new economy.
7. Reduce defense spending waste.
8. Enforce environmental protections so that companies can't cost-shift the effects of their production onto the public.

Just to name a few."
"How much contraband beer selling is going on? With good beer at $2-3 per bottle, how can black market beer make any money?

This is the appropriate comparison to weed. Tobacco is highly addictive and carcinogenic so the taxes are multiples of the cost of production and distribution. . Beer and pot - taxes should be a fraction of the cost of production and distribution. Why? Because they are relatively safe."
"Well, we have very different ideas about how life works. First of all, America's ""poor"" enjoy a higher standard of living than many people in Europe's middle class. Second, central/government control has failed wherever, however and whenever it has ever been tried (see Venezuela for an ongoing very current tragedy). I believe that with the exception of civil rights, Black Americans are worse off today than they were when Democrats first decided to ""help"" them with what has become in too many cases, generational welfare. I believe that having to work in order to eat is an essential part of the human experience. Whether it's the children of the rich or unemployed welfare recipients who have never had a job and who have no intention of ever getting a job, the results are the same. Actual accomplishment is the only path to genuine self-esteem. As for Snopes, they have been repeatedly found to be more interested in promoting the (failed) progressive agenda than in accurately evaluating fact"
"The use of Japanese-Americans causes a cringe.  To be historically correct, Japanese-Americans are the Issei's, the first generation Japanese who came from Japan and adopted the United States as their Country.  All who followed are Americans of Japanese ancestry.  The Nisei and on, as I a Yonsei.  The WWII Nisei veterans were AJA's, or Americans of Japanese ancestry.  Those WWII Nisei veterans were in combat as Americans and excelled.  There were another group, the Kibei's, or AJA's sent back to Japan as children for their education and returned to the United States prior to the War.  Had to post the correction.  Go For Broke."
"Exactly.  The #1 performer in the S&P is the Financial sector - Banks.  And why are they doing well?  Because they are forecasting rising inflation and rising interest rates due to the Trump Administration doing a whole bunch of deficit spending.  I'm no economist, but it seems to me that these trends don't bode well for most Americans.

Where ARE those TEA Party guys anyway?  Massive deficits no longer matter now that the black guy isn't in office?"
"Is Trump hostile towards Muslims? He said at the National Prayer Breakfast, ""We have seen peace-loving Muslims brutalized, victimized, murdered, and oppressed by ISIS killers."" He said his tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture “was a meaningful reminder of why we have to fight bigotry, intolerance and hatred in all of its very ugly forms.”
The campaign statements Trump made can be interpreted differently than the way the State presented it, and in any case, may not represent the current intentions.
In his ruling, Judge Watson said, ""It is undisputed that the Executive Order does not facially discriminate for or against any particular religion, or for or against religion versus non-religion. "" Then he goes on to invalidate it based on Trump's implied intention. Such a ruling could have unintended consequences. Can the courts now halt drone strikes against ISIS because of what someone thinks is the implied intention of Trump against Muslims?"

"You are exactly correct. The original demonstrators had a permit to demonstrate, the foreigner soros' funded anarchists and professional agitators caused all the problems while the media twisted this to state only the original demonstrators were violent. I saw a photo of a black guy using an improvised flame thrower to attack a demonstrator, the media claimed he was ""defending himself"". Typical of the MSM. All while the cops busted heads of the original demonstrators while doing NOTHING to stop the soros funded professional anarchists."

Perhaps we just have to accept that South Africa is an African nation and can be expected to behave as such.
"DeVos said that historically black colleges and universities are “real pioneers when it comes to school choice.” That's like saying that baseball's Negro Leagues were real pioneers of affirmative action.

"Many times you have accused people here of not being faithful Catholics; of not being 'orthodox'. 
And yet your own disagreements with the Church of Rome are well-known.
The inconsistency is noted - except by you, it seems.
A day or two ago, I wrote that you preferred the SSPX. Someone then proceeded to accuse me of 'calumny' (because he wrongly thought that the SSPX were 'in schism').
I was actually making the point that - albeit at different ends of the spectrum - we were both in the one Church. 
Yesterday, on another site, you wrote: ""The SSPX is likely to be eventually recognised as the true Church whilst the false Church occupies the Vatican, the Cathedrals and Basilicas."" You also wrote: ""I do not attend SSPX churches, mostly on account of its geographic availability... I am not a sedevacantist so, the SSPX is the last hope for orthodox Catholics who wish to continue following their religion. ""
And today, I see that the SSPX is close to returning to full communion. What then?"
Globalist governance you mean. Don't worry he may be cryogenically stored until he can be revived.
"Sounds like confirmation bias - You found exactly what you were looking for. In reality, Eugene provides FAR more low income housing for the general public than they do for formerly incarcerated citizens who have turned their lives around but are discriminated against through baseless fears.

No woman should be judged by the actions of some women. No black citizen should be judged by the actions of some black citizens. And no one with a criminal record should be judged by the actions of some people with a criminal record.

One in four Americans have been incarcerated. 25%. Our neighborhoods are already PACKED with individuals who moved right into a decent living situation while this group just happens to also be struggling with poverty. Unless opponents are advocating to purge our neighborhoods of a quarter of their residents, it's completely reasonable to understand that the opposition is thoroughly uninformed or intentionally discriminatory - and some are both."

This is the guy who took on the Conservative Black Belt street fighter, and whupped him in about a minute, without breaking a sweat. I still remember all the braying and ""he's going to be beaten to a pulp"" from all the angry right wing commenters here. They were salivating at the pain they were expecting to see Trudeau suffer.

And of course the ladies love Trudeau. Why? Because he's disciplined, fit, cares about kids and is not fearful and afraid. Nearly all these attempts to ""feminize"" Trudeau come from angry men, who mostly seem to dislike independent and smart women who can think for themselves.

Sorry to burst your bubble here ""therock"" but you're telling us more about yourself than you realise when you make comments like this. I've never voted Liberal in my life, in case you're wondering, but I can spot a grown up, confident guy when I see one.

"Especially since that was back before the Legislature really abdicated any financial responsibility for the U of O and my income taxes were paying for more of it than they do today, that question tended to make me a little cranky as well.  My children weren't black or native American minorities or financially disadvantaged because both I and my wife worked, so maybe all the scholarship money went to affirmative action.   The non-minority middle class are the payers, not the recipients of governmental largesse, even that doled out by Duck U.  I've always commented on the fact that the Asian minorities in this country aren't treated any better than the Caucasians, however.  Wonder why that is; and why so many of them seem to excel in the difficult and therefore high-paying fields like math and science.  The phrase 'work ethic' keeps running through my mind, though."
"But that's just it:
No baker, not even Mr. Phillips, would ask a straight couple about their sex life or drinking habits or whether the couple gambles. It would be considered rude, an invasion of privacy. The baker would soon be out of business.
But, bakers such as Mr. Phillips don't need to ask rude questions of a gay couple. The evidence of the couple's ""sin"" is standing right in front of the offended baker. Two men. Asking about a wedding cake.
Years ago, I saw a TV news story about racial discrimination. A young woman called an apartment building manager about an apartment for rent. The landlord said he had a unit available. The young woman said the moment she opened the manager's door and walked in, the manager's whole demeanor changed. The manager no longer cared about the woman's income or previous rental history, etc. All the manager cared was that the woman was black. The manager told the woman the apartment was rented. Days later, the ""for rent"" sign was still out front."

"Again, but one last time respectfully Q HALL, then I am done. Everything you have stated about Mr. Trump was well known and discussed prior to the election, just as Ms. Clinton, we had 2 real choices, and America decided on Mr. Trump. I believe that is more a reflection on how the nation felt about Ms. Clinton, and that hopefully the Democrats can find a better candidate next time. 
Yes, I voted Mr. Trump, the Supreme Court was the reason.
Then you bring forward George Wallace and Dixiecrats, which is fine, I bring forward the 60's, Muhammad Ali, Lyndon Johnson, Nation of Islam's association with the NAZI George Lincoln Rockwell, Eledridge Cleaver who boasted of rape as a Black Activist, and explain a bit more about the 1960's, it was a different, more bitter era, in America.
What ended my discussion with you, was the personal attacks you leveled, even on having civility and being respectful of others in discussions where differences are discussed. Thus I ended any further discussions."
And all they have to show for it is a bunch of welfare-dependent Muslims and Africans. It is truly sad.
"As always Sheema an excellent piece.  The world is a better place with you in it.  Know Thyself is one of the greatest maxims out there and you always appear to be doing just that.   

Let's all recall racism and intolerance has been here since day one with humankind.  In Canada, the French, the Catholic, the Irish were held in low regard for decades and decades, after that the Italians, the eastern Europeans were looked down upon, black people came next, Jewish people (esp Montreal); after many years they became a part of the national fabric (despite what BLM says), I am forgetting some I know but things take time, and immigration should be made slow to reflect this.  And almost most importantly all our children should attend the same schools.  There should be no religious based schools during the week and that schooling should be kept for the evening and weekends.  Only way we will integrate is through our children."
The President should not be calling for an execution before the trial has taken place.  Trump is the same guy who called for the execution of the Central Park 5 likely because they were black.  The Central Park 5 were later exonerated by DNA evidence.

"ACA was taken from the Republicans who all of a sudden did not like it because Americas first black president pushed it. The party of no is racist and small minded, just like the dixiecrats who took over the Republican party my grampa was in, and turned it from a working persons party, to a racist corrupt and corporate stooge party that in turn was taken over by the tea baggers and then the Trumpsters who rode to power on a platform of lies, mistruth, racism and corruption, off the colluding with a known enemy power to commit espionage and treason."
"Ahh, prohibition! Isn't it great?
This is so much better than legalizing heroin, cocaine, and so on, and regulating their production and distribution via licensed dispensaries.
What's the fun if drug use doesn't involve a little high stakes Russian Roulette?
Plus, under prohibition, we get all the exciting news about drug-related gang turf wars, and the property crime that goes toward paying for drugs...
And society gets to pay through the nose so that first responders can whizz around all day long to fentanyl overdose after carfentanil overdose!
Government is so smart. It just does the best, most smartest thing all the time.
After all, we don't want to ""send the wrong message"" by legalizing and regulating drugs, do we?
That would be awful. It's far better that people who use do so in full risk of their lives, some as prolific property criminals, each contributing financially to the growth of violent black markets that negatively affect entire communities.
Like I said: Smart!"
"So I will clean up my previous post. I as an Alaska outdoorsman must judge a moose to be 50"" or greater or suffer a fine and penalties, just rcd. notice that a course must be passed prior to hunting moose in units 7 and 15 to properly identify! You almost need a lawyer to decipher all laws required by the same people responsible for this shoot first fiasco. Now we have supposed professional staff that have the id of a black faced bear ALREADY shot and they shoot 3 others prior to hopefully getting the right one. Sounds like the old poachers ""ground checking"" to me. The race was over a young man lost his life and now for pure political gotta show em we are in control this happens. How many of you hailing this activity are anti hunters? We live in Alaska this is a wild place and things happen that we all feel terrible about, animal attacks, drownings and the list goes on, we CHOOSE to be here! It doesn't make it right to let these hired ""experts"" go about things this way."
"Agreed, you are what your record says you are. Since June this has been a losing team lead by a manager with a career losing record. Until Buddy Black can prove he can lead a team to a postseason winning run, he will remain a good ""player's manager"", not a ""winning manager"". In the end, the record will tell us about Black and the players. As of today, this group does not look to have what it takes. If they miss the postseason, they will have done the complete opposite of the 2007 team. They will have chocked and lost a lead of over 10+ games to another team that did not make any big moves at the trade deadline. This one win hurt and cost several good players a place on this team. In a few seasons, it might cost Buddy his job too!"

"Ok... I hear you. But! The presidential campaign is only one item on your ballot. No you won't be able to go in a pop one button and be done. You will have to move through the whole ballot and choose those you can vote for. I have been where you are.  I remember weeping in the polling booth.But not for the reasons you describe.
I saw that I had lived to see every oppressed minority make it on to a presidential ballot. An African American - A Woman - A Catholic - A POW/Veteran.... I felt like a Mom asked to choose between her children as to which ones she loved best. I voted the rest of the ballot, contest by contest. 
Staying home and not voting really isn't an option because it dishonors all those who gave so much that I may vote. Even if you only vote for one contest on your entire ballot.... you can do that! I've been pained by the voting against rather than the voting for style of voting. So if there is only 1 vote for situation I can find -- then that's the only contest I vote in."
"And you feel the same about Black Lives Matter, right?"
"Yeah, except they forgot to pick an aboriginal anchor, but I'm sure Justin Trudeau will be apologizing for this before the end of the week.  Wanna place a bet?  Also, I see no black anchors, so what's Black Lives Matter going to say about this?"

"Thoughtful article which made me think. Hadiya is quite proud of her gifted intelligence but that does bring along some challenges. Being a couple of years younger than my classmates made it difficult for me to develop social skills and 60 years later I still see that in how I interact with others. I also have a gifted grandson who was reading at age 4 and was helping kids 2 grades ahead of him with their math. But he had real problems fitting in. For me, it was not until I was at the Masters level when I learned to keep scholastic achievements very quiet in order to fit in.

I can see that Hadiya has experienced subtle discrimination, both real and perceived. I would encourage her however not to spend too much time playing the poor little me card while other people of colour succeed. That has happened to blacks in the US where Latinos have caught and passed blacks in average income."

"The British Black and Tans were comprised of veterans of Wirld War I. Not all had the personal and family resources to help them cope with life after a horrorific war. Many were causing trouble and the British government thought they had found a solution for them and ""the Catholic ""

Also there never arose a great advocate like Ghanaian out of Ireland. I always wondered though ""The Informer"" may partially explain why.

"""can a hate message be peaceful?""
This is an excellent moral/ethical dilemma which I don't think I can truly answer. For the purposes of the First Amendment and the purposes of ""protesting"" I think the answer is yes. When BLM was protesting, several of their chants were ""hateful"", even threatening towards police.
One of their worst was ""Pigs in a blanket, fry em' like bacon""
That chant meets your argument of ""hate message"" but was considered acceptable by the left. (Even defended) Only one of the racist chants I heard on the news hold a candle to that imo. (Much of the crap spewing out of their mouths as individuals was worse though.)
.
If we silence these people now, where does it stop? I think next on the list would be religious organizations that are against homosexuality. Laws need to be applied to everyone equally and shouldn't be revocable when its convenient to a majority.
.
We should condemn their ideology through starvation of attention, not silencing them."
"""Hindu and Muslim attitudes to women are actually very similar"". Did I say or imply that? Nope, because I don't usually bring my religion into a discussion.

India has been a lot more progressive about democratic rights for women than other countries.AlI Indian women could vote in 1947 (as soon as India became independent), whereas Swiss women could vote in 1971 (note, that was less than 70 years ago). Black women in the US South could vote in 1965 (a change within your lifetime). Native women in Canada could vote starting in 1960.British ruled Hong Kong Chinese women could vote in 1994. 

India had a female PM in 1966. When asked by Nixon if she would prefer to be called Mrs Gandhi or Madam Prime Minister, she replied Madam Prime Minister. She added that her cabinet colleagues called her ""Sir"".

Now I won't say women in India are equal. There is a long way to go.But a low caste woman can be a premier of a province there. A minority woman has never ruled a province in the US or Canada."

He was sentenced to one year of probation. A probation discharge report filed in June 2015 shows that Greene received a mental health evaluation and “complied with the medication recommendations,” according to the newspaper.

He sounds like he should have access to firearms."
"Excuse me...."" perfectly legal herb "" ?  No it's not. It's still against federal law. Many safety sensitive jobs require employees to be drug free---and pot is rightly considered a drug .Over time many will lose their jobs because they foolishly thought because pot was claimed to be "" legal "" they could use it when they couldn't. One of the problems that was pointed out in the debate over if pot should be made legal or not was how it was harder to prove if a person was impaired with pot.  Pot supporters didn't care in the least about public safety in their quest to legalize the drug. Even in comments to this story they boast in how it will be hard to prove . Last week we read in the Dispatch how the black market isn't going away as pot supporters claimed it would. Every claim pot supporters made to get votes is turning out to be false.   Do you want your bus driver or pilot flying stoned when your own safety is in their hands ? Sadly , pot supporters would scream sure , no problem man."

Require reinforced concrete fronts perhaps vehicle stop stones or concrete blocks out front , like at any secure building Target has them in shape of Red Balls , this might be fighting for Gun Stores as well ..

They need to be a bit more secure than a Clothing Consignment store they do deal in death after all be it for furry Animals, birds and or "" Bad Gun Owners""  .. They are Local Gun depots not convenience stores.. we have to treat them as such . This is a place of business that sells weapons that can be used in a wide variety of ways . Some legal others not . It's my theory that many not all smash and grabs are insurance scams and the guns stolen are then sold on the Black Market . A win , win for everybody in the Gun business and the straw buyer then is bypassed entirely . Big Money for everyone"
"""Too little too late"" we are reactionaries not actionaries. The problems faced by the South African Airways should have been dealt with a long time ago and the Airline problems could have been solved or averted. The word of God says ""Wore unto a body that is on a mad head."" Most of the difficulties and problems we face as a country are man made. We tend to blame foreign governments, foreign people or others within ourselves forgetting that the enemy is ourselves. We do not have a government but a bunch of looters who are after their own interest not serving the Nation. Our Mozambiquean Neighbors have a saying or word ""POVO"" meaning a person who believes anything. Our Nation believes in anything without putting it to test and that is the reason we are where we are and it is going to be far worse unless the Almighty God intervenes. Fellow South Africans we are our own liberators lets stand up and fight to give ourselves real freedom. Africa is very rich it is us Africans that are poor."
"But Santa is Christ-centered, whether people know it or not. Although it may seem Santa is secular, it's the principle of his character -- to be a giving, generous person -- that is based on what the bible instructs us to do in life. Be good neighbors, give to the poor, be kind to one another, bless people, share and give generously, etc. Santa represents goodness and kindness, what is wrong with that? No need to traumatize a child at a mall. by age 10 or so, they find out that Santa isn't real, but the concept of Santa plays out in their parents, family, friends, etc who give gifts out of love. This guy is creating a battle when there's really no need to fight the belief of Santa in our culture. Black Friday, well, that's another something horrible that could be rallied against, but not Santa."

I used to agree that it would be better for her to just let it go, but round about when the first commentators starting comparing Zille to Zuma, when real hatespeech by black people (Velaphi Khumalo), and real racism by black people (like Fikele's rant on Mmusi's wife) has no consequence what so ever, when I realised this is about a trend in South Africa that will lead down a dark path. 
Zille is definitely not a racist yet you expect her to plead guilty to it.

"Kaepernick wasn't blacklisted for expressing his first amendment rights, he was let go for being distracted on the job. 

Football players are paid to do their job, which is to play football at the highest level. How do you think Exxon would feel if their CEO took a knee for Black Lives Matter before every board meeting? Or how would you feel if your plumber made a speech about LGBTQ rights before fixing your toilet?

Professionals are hired to be professionals, and focus on the job at hand. Kaepernick clearly so many interests outside of the NFL, that being a pro-level QB was no longer his #1 priority. And you can't pay some one millions of dollars to be unfocused. That's just the way the world works."

I felt like I must have missed a good 30 minutes of the movie to be so far behind. The movie just seemed to go on forever. But I had to admit  it was thrilling.   I had to see it a second time to  realize i had missed about one minute.
Your argument is that the Pride event should take up every marginalized group's cause. A show of solidarity perhaps but to regress on the progress made between the LGBTQ community and police should not be the desired outcome. BLMTO was out of line and Pride organizers allowed themselves to be bullied.  Does every group that holds up the parade get their way?
"You are correct.However, communism is a western ideology, invented by Germans like Marx and Engels. 

Yes, I am going to blame Apartheid on the British. It was implemented while they were in power. Unless you think that the blacks had equal rights under them?

And if the Hong Kong Chinese can't vote now, that only proves my point that the |british and the Chinese Communists are equally democratic. At least the Chinese communists don't prevent other Chinese from holding senior position in the Hong Kong government.

The UK is the birthplace of the industrialized world, because it looted Asia and Africa thoroughly. When the British first came to India in the 17th century, they had 2 percent of the world economy, and India had 23 percent. In the 20th century, after ruling India for 200 years, the UK had 9 percent of the world economy, and India fell to 2 percent."

Evangelical Protestants are high, too, with 58% going weekly compared to 55% high school grads. Black Protestants are similar -- with 59% of college grads going weekly to 52% high school grads doing likewise. Among Catholics, 45% Catholic college grads go to church weekly compared to 39% high school grads. This suggests -- all the more -- that Christians should be for universal education of some sort."

"I failed to mention in my comment, former heavy weight boxing champion of the world, Joe Louis.  When World War II started, he donated thousands of dollars to the Army and Navy Relief Funds, and when that was not enough, he enlisted in the Army in late 1942.  He travelled thousands of miles worldwide during World War II performing almost 100 boxing exhibitions as a morale-booster for the fighting men and women.  Ali could have done the same.  Unlike Muhammed Ali, Joe Louis was a true patriot, soldier and a black-American of great character."
"That is a very isolated Wilderness area.  It has some rugged terrain.   It is also an area with dense cougar and black bear populations.

One really should not hike such remote places by yourself.  Especially if you are elderly.  It is much safer to hike in a group of people when visiting Wilderness areas.  That way if a person gets injured, others can help him, and also go to get help.   Maybe even bring some kind of weapon with you. 

Here is a link below to a real good in-depth, follow-up story that the Oregonian newspaper did about this subject after U of O mathematics professor Daming Xu disappeared while Wilderness hiking in 2007, and Eugene hiker James Dutton disappeared in 2012.   Shockingly, the Oregonian noted that between 1997 and 2013, 189 men, and 51 women have disappeared in Oregon Wilderness areas, never to be seen again.  That is 240 people lost in just 17 years!!

"Gleaned from the article:  the institutional Church does not know how to minister to black people and/or to young people and is struggling to even listen when representatives tell it what's lacking.  

Does the institutional Church really know how to minister effectively to women, the very poor, single people, the LGBT community, immigrants, divorced/remarried people, to those who have been (permanently) alienated by the child sexual abuse nightmare...etc. 

I know in many, maybe even most, parishes people are ministered to, and they do their own ministering to their community in turn.  But, I have to wonder given the creeping numbers of former Catholics now ""nones,"" exactly who really is the focus of parish outreach and service?"

The claim that Lincoln wanted to send all blacks to Central America is a ""NEO CONFEDERATE"", claim.  The link to the article provided repudiates that claim.  Mr. Harris, the author of this RG printed opinion piece bases his thinking, beliefs, and opinion piece on what could be called a racist (NEO CONFEDERATE) attempt to have Lincoln support their racist views.  The RG in its desire to publish anything ""racial"", didn't even bother to check out Harris' ""facts"".  This is what our current trend of shoddy racial academics and journalism has come to.

It's legal. Don't like the price? Don't worry, there'll be tons of black market stuff available . . . this IS Canada after all.

So what do we have to look forward to, other than Liberals getting very wealthy as they quickly jump into the pot investment markets? (oops, my mistake, many Liberals are already investing)

People will die on our roads from drivers carrying legal or even not-so-legal pot in their shirt pockets (who can tell the difference?). We're going to have more medical issues - lungs, memory, ""accidental"" injuries. There will be increased performance issues in the workplace. Many, many more young developing brains are going to be affected and parents will have another huge challenge in combating pot that's really, really easy to get."
"While I do yoga and was a Girl Scout (and leader), my far greater concern is the silence of everyday Catholics on the administration's rhetoric and treatment of immigrants and the poor, especially people of color. Jesus is clear on what is expected of us in the familiar Matthew 25. We have become a country of exclusion, gated communities, and mass incarceration. As Catholics, we know a God of mercy, who came only for sinners, and is the ultimate giver of second chances. Jesus said we would see Him in the poor, the unwanted, the strangers in our midst. Have we become too frightened to meet Him?"

"I have lived in the upper Hillside in the same house since 1983, about a 1/4 mile from the Upper Huffman entrance to Chugach Park. Until about 2011, we rarely saw any bears in the yard and never brown bears. 

Since then, we have had an explosion of bears, both black and brown in the neighborhood and I have the pictures to prove it, including pictures of two grizzly cubs. Those bears are now full grown and I have great pictures of them as adults trying to climb up on my neighbor's deck after I chased them out of my yard. 

We are a pretty bear aware neighborhood but for whatever reason, the bears are here in much greater numbers than in the past and they are hanging out much closer than they ever have. The novelty has worn off a bit and we are now my much more cautious than we have ever been just because we seem them much more frequently. 

I don't think we need a hunt now but if the numbers keep increasing, the option will have to be on the table."

"key words of this rags story:

Homeowner shot black naked man in fountain.  The statement mentioned nothing about what the guy did to be accused of breaking and entering.

One's car broke down and the other was just sitting in his car and the cop thought he was a threat and killed him.

Left unsaid of course, is what you would have to do in teaching, nursing, and other well-paying professions to balance it the other way....not that that would ever be on the agenda, or course...

Saul Alinsky first act of rebellion was scamming free lunch in collage cafeterias and organizing other students to do the same. The left does not know their history. Democrat’s strategy was making blacks as dependent as possible on government to secure their votes. Then they began a cynical smear campaign to label anyone who opposes their devious strategy as greedy racists. Democrats fought to keep slavery alive where Republicans fought against it i.e. Abraham Lincoln the Democrats are responsible for the Jim Crow laws, The Republican Party was founded primarily to oppose slavery, Republicans eventually abolished slavery. The Democratic Party tried to maintain and expand slavery. The 13th Amendment, abolishing slavery, passed in 1865 with 100% Republican support but only 23% Democrat support in congress. The Ku Klux Klan was originally and primarily an arm of the Southern Democratic Party."

 2. After the publication of the post-synodal exhortation Amoris Laetitia (304), does one still need to regard as valid the teaching of St. John Paul II’s encyclical Veritatis Splendor, 79, based on sacred Scripture and on the Tradition of the Church, on the existence of absolute moral norms that prohibit intrinsically evil acts and that are binding without exceptions?
 
3. After Amoris Laetitia (301) is it still possible to affirm that a person who habitually lives in contradiction to a commandment of God’s law, as for instance the one that prohibits adultery (Matthew 19:3-9), finds him or herself in an objective situation of grave habitual sin (Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts, “Declaration,” June 24, 2000)?

"The shootings in Kent State may not  have the same impact today as it did during the Vietnam era. The frequency of police shooting unarmed African Americans, and the daily incidents of mass murder, many of which go unreported by national media, overshadow the shooting of four university students.  And it is always important to remember that shortly after Kent there was another shooting in Jackson State, which killed two African Americans who were inside their dorm room at the time, and frequently that shooting has never been given the same scrutiny as the Ohio shooting. However, its true that for many middle class university students  in the 70s the shootings at Kent State became a defining moment in their political beliefs and commitment to social justice causes for the next fifty years. I have known many union activists  and life long NDP supporters  who cite the outrage they felt over the events of  May 4, 1970 as influencing them to this day."

They do call out the antifa folks when they are looting, they did call out the BLM folks when they were rioting in Baltimore, maybe not as strongly as you would like, but it did happen.  The problem is that when the violence comes from the right, people tend to die, the church shooter, the planned parenthood shooter, the OKC bombing, all with body counts.  Yes, it happens from the left as well, the VA Congress shooting, the Dallas cops, but it tends to be less common, no matter how you try to spin it."

""... people who have been cast aside by the cruelty of corporate capitalism, have embraced holy war. Their lives, battered by economic misery and social marginalization, have suddenly been filled with meaning. They hold themselves up as the vanguard of the oppressed. They arrogate to themselves the right to use force to silence those they define as the enemy. They sanctify anger. They're infected with the dark, adrenaline-driven urge for confrontation that arises among the disenfranchised when a democracy ceases to function. They're separated, as Sigmund Freud wrote of those who engage in fratricide, by the “narcissism of minor differences.” They mirror each other, not only ideologically but also physically—armed and dressed in black, the color of fascism and the color of death.""

There was the grusome beating of the Emancipation Park lawn by the feet of counter-protesters fleeing Richard Preston as he shot at them.

There was the despicable damage done to James Field's beautiful car by Heather Heyer's body and the bodies of 19 other vicious counter-protesters as he mowed them down in it.

And of course there is the impending dismantling of Robert E Lee's gorgeous metallic horsey-riding likeness, ending it's all too brief 93 year run of intimidating the black citizens of Charlottesville and celebrating Lee's unsuccessful attempt to destroy America and perpetuate slavery with a war that killed close to 1 million people.

We must stop these liberals from abusing our lawns with their feet as they flee gun violence, wrecking our cars with their bodies as we run them over and destroying our horsey-riding statues to our enemies' slavery-championing war heros!"
Nonsense. Stalin and Mao were atheists. Hitler was agnostic. The pursuit of power is by far the greatest cause of all conflict.
"Blacks have been marginalized for centuries in the US, arguably our own indiginous people have been as well - yet neither descended into the murderous cult that radicalized Muslims represent.  Many radicals are in fact - not destitute or marginalized. The difference is Islam itself - because of it's many interpretations, it is the ""enabler"" that provides the twisted justification for heinous acts. To what end? Who cares! The solution is starting to form but doesn't seem to get much play in the media - the solution is with the Imams. A cohesive organization of ALL Imams in Canada that publicly and continually  shoot down the notion of Jihad and terrorism - and to publicly accuse all terrorists of apostacy - of sullying the name of Allah.  Canadian Imams should have leadership that has the authority to monitor mosques, Imams and their teachings - in a helpful and respectful way. Can't speak for the rest of the world but it would seem that Canadian Muslims can fix things here."
"There feelings cloud logic. They are willing to vote for someone as long as they say nice things. That's all they care about, and since the media doesn't talk anymore about Hillary calling black men ""super predators"" they don't know she has said racist, sexist things."
Anthony Lamar Smith needed to be killed. Did you see how he slammed his car into other cars with danger for live for bystanders? And then bent down to retrieve an item from a box when ordered out of the car? He could have reached for  a gun. The Blacks rioting are on the criminal's side - as too often .
"""Black activists have raised the call for an end to violence, not an escalation of it. Yesterday’s attack was the result of the actions of a lone gunman. To assign the actions of one person to an entire movement is dangerous and irresponsible. We continue our efforts to bring about a better world for all of us.""  #BLM"
"Linda seems to be a bit clueless about what racial terminology is. Yes, slants is not a very common name for Asians but Orientals is. And anachronistic racial terms, or any racial terms, for that matter, should not be used as mascots. We don't have trams like the Negroes or the Orientals for a good reason. Pirates are not a race nor is it derogstory to an entire continent of people."
So Hitler was anti jew because he left alone 50 percent of the Jewish people in the world? The KKK isn't racist because they leave black people in Africa alone? You have a high bar for discrimination.
Please re-read his post.   'Many people' heard and ran. Not just one black man.  And I don't recall him saying there were any witnessess who said it was a black man that fired the gun shots.   Per Charles Hern - it's Vegas.  Everything is video-taped.
"Dear bishops.   FYI:  we are not the people shooting black people by the score, every day.

PS:  Thanks for caving to the PC mob."
"To my knowledge not once has BLM marched in protest of the daily, weekly mulitple killing of Blacks shooting other Blacks in Chicago or anywhere else. The question becomes is Black Lives Matter really about the individual lives of Black Americans being lost or is it really a cover for something else?

IMHO Black Lives Matter is a farce and is becoming a very destructive force in America today. I for one have noticed the rhetoric their leadership displays, in general, more interest in promoting racism then working to end racism. And as I point out the multiple black on black killings that take place each and everyday you never hear a peep of outrage from Black Lives Matter becomes rather self evident.

People should wake up and realize ALL lives matter regardless of skin color."
"Ok smart one.  How many other black Muslim candidates were running for a House seat this past election in the district that Mr. Jones happen to be in?  Nada.  Just because Demboski didn't state Mr. Jones' name doesn't mean she wasn't referring to him specifically.  And let's not forget that Demboski denied saying that Mayor Berkowitz supported incest.  Demboski has a rotten habit of lighting the fuse of a stick of political dynamite, but once lit she back peddles and puts on her Pinocchio liar face.  I'd drag her to court."
"It is true that more black are killed by blacks than blues.  This report is on Police brutality and violation of CIVIL rights.  Rights against civilians.  BLM arose because of issues such as those raised in this report. 
I'm not ignoring the other statistics, nor do I condone the shooting of police officers, at all.
But is you are a law abiding citizen, you have rights or at least you should."

"The way I remember Bill Curtis narrate the drug history in the USA is that prohibition of MJ targeted Latinos, not Blacks; and that ""crazed Negro"" was the fig leaf behind cocaine prohibition.

 This being said, the tide really turned on drugs after an epic epidemic of opioid abuse after Civil War in US, and at the turn of the 20th century - worldwide."
"Hate crimes perpetrated by blacks are VERY rarely reported or charged as such. It's so common, it's become a case of ""dog bites man."""
"Being as we live in his fiefdom now, the first thing I noticed was that Granpa Comment Section sounds like he’s sundowning again. 

But seriously — why is Sudan in, and Chad out? 

Apart from “gotta have some bunch of black Africans to kick around”, which is I assume Steven Miller’s advice?"
"Being black is tough. Being a woman is also tough. Two strikes  there. In the early 80's, as a petite blonde woman who chose veterinary medicine as a career, I can tell you that getting a job there wasn't an easy slog either. It didn't take me long to get over my my hopes to have a career in the dairy industry. It's funny how women can take a major role in the drudge work of farming, but that was only ok if you weren't being paid for professional services. Things have changed. I think a lot. ..... But I don't agree that there is a preference for people to choose associates who look like themselves. They  choose people who look like the people they grew up with and saw in those positions they are hiring for. After all I never met a Golden Retriever who much cared that the dog next door was a black lab. Afterall, you don't really see yourself. You see what's around you. Put another way, the more black female lawyers there are today, the more there will be tomorrow."
"It has nothing to do with how much money someone makes. People in the military and vets all have a whole different level of commitment and value system. Not standing for the National Anthem and the flag is about as derogatory as a racial slur. It's like calling a black man the ""N"" word. You hear nothing after that. Your whole message is lost and now you have pissed off a whole segment of the fan base. We come to games to get away from all of this B.S. I myself served 8 years in the Army and when I saw this it was and is a spit in the face. I also am a season ticket holder that will not be there this Sunday for the first time in 15 years. This is about as offensive as it gets and I won't be apart of such nonsense. People who have never served really don't understand the dedication we have for our country. And we don't expect them to, just don't make a mockery of our service and sacrifice."
"Barry may be intelligent, but he's also a condescending, opinionated, pansy who, in my opinion, was ill qualified to be president, was elected because he was a black man who could speak well, and has taken this country in the wrong direction in several ways. The most notable being the ill conceived Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act that is currently crumbling due to its inherent faults.
That doesn't mean that Trump will do better. A Trump administration will offer many significant challenges. I can only hope that those leaders in Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, will hold the line on any legislation Trump may propose that is inimical to the good health of our nation.
As to the ridiculousness of my statement, it's true and accurate. When Barry was elected and re-elected, I was depressed for weeks. I know what Friedman and many Clinton supporters are going through and they have my sincere sympathy."
"A terrorist group may not be protected...but an individual citizen who may sympathize with a terrorist group could be. He doesn't have to be a member of the KKK. Just a guy who likes the KKK and takes delight in screwing with this black business owners because he resents the fact that he is a business owner and not a janitor or a share cropper. I am making it complicated because I see the law as protecting ONE group of people and saying ""screw you"" to all other minority groups. In this example the Baker in the case has stopped making wedding cakes. It would be a shame if a Jewish or Black or Latino or Asian baker had to make the same type of decision when they harbor no ill will towards anyone other than those who harbor ill will towards them.

"Hey Charles, sounds like some good advice, so, if you really care about all black lives and not just the extremely small amount killed by police, (usually due to their own decisions) why don't you use that 40 years of experience and go into the inner cities where bad choices are getting so many black lives killed daily and try and help? Or do you find it easier to just spew your racism here and bemoan the results of 50 years of dems ruling the inner cities? Do you really care about all black lives Charles?  Do you really want change? Or are you content being used and keeping up the racism? If you don't care about all lives then it's okay to continue with your hate, just please quit blaming others for the bad decisions you support that have failed so 
 many so miserably."
"So let me get this straight, Republicans will vote for a corporate shill reality show star bigot who has insulted every walk of life including a gold star family, but chastise a man practicing his freedom of speech because he's half black and not a patriot? Hmm."

"""It gives the message that the primary purpose of marriage is sexual satisfaction...""  Wrong.  Such a judgmental statement is in ignorance of how anyone and everyone chooses to marry: it is out of love, and one way that love is expressed is through the intimacy of sexual union.  Terms like ""Divine Will"" and ""attempts to overturn the long-held Judeo-Christian concepts of marriage..."" are smokescreens for the oppression of others.  The concept of marriage changes a number of times before Jesus was born, so which ""long held"" concepts are you referring to?  And is not the Church's traditional view of marriage as being for procreation?  That involves having sex, does it not?  So, once again, you reveal for us quite well the inconsistent, and discriminating position of the Church in its outmoded and self-serving approach to marriage, to partnership, and to love and union.  We've heard it all before, and it still makes little sense, just like celibacy and creeping infallibility."
"This has nothing to do with Canada.

Muslims import their sectarian violence into Canada. It was a born-Muslim Moroccan and a new convert attacked the Mosque.

"" ... Suspects identified as Mohamed El Khadir and Alexandre Bissonnette, according to court officials ..""

Islam, once a religion of peace, has become a mental sickness today. It has descended into sectarianism where the majority sect is excommunicating  anyone who does not agree with it, leading into senseless violence and terror.

Trump may not have any solutions, he has identified the problem alright. This attack is one more reason to keep them out. There are too many of them already. Do we want more of these guys here?"
"Crutcher  was another loser with a record. While I believe there are cases where LEO abuse their power towards black people, this particular case is not about race. Cops ran his plates and knew who he was which is why they approached him the way they did. The fact he was photographed wearing an ankle holster with a pulled up pant leg and he had a gun is proof. 

The disturbing part in this case is the wife who KNEW he was violent and had a gun. She KNEW he had a gun, and all does is yell that ""he does NOT have a gun, he does NOT have a gun!"" She claimed he had a TBI. 

WHY? Was she hoping to convince cops he was mentally unstable so they wouldn't follow protocol? Was she hoping they let their guard down so he could shoot them? Why would she LIE? 

God forbid someone who doesn't have a gun does have a TBI is in this situation. No wonder cops have to treat people as if they are truly a threat and a danger at all times. She should be charged. She knowingly put all LEO in danger. Charges!!"
"They should all be given long sentences and thrown in prison like they did during the crack epidemic, but of course  that situation involved  a bunch o black and brown people, so now it's treatment, sympathy, and a public health emergency.

"While Mr. Obama was in office, you wrote relentlessly racist comments here every day about both Mr. & Mrs. Obama.  References to jungles and such.  Every day.  You didn't like Mr. Obama because he's black.  The written evidence created by your own hand was grotesque and constant."
"""What do we want dead cops, when do we want them now!"" This chant are others of a similar nature have been heard and recorded at several BLM marches...five Dallas cops were killed at a BLM march, for BLM to then condemn someone for taking this very action they, at the very least failed to control, is hypocritical. For Obama to invite them to the White House was simply him, once again raising his middle finger to law enforcement, and law abiding Americans."
"One of my biggest pet peeves [as a beautiful, healthy WASP male] was a black friend of mine from high school who was given tutors for every class to help him succeed in college.

"You're lying about me of course, as you seem to do every day now.  I never think about you.  Not ever.  Don't you think it's weird that you think about me so often?  I sure do!

I'm happily married, by the way - so don't get any ideas.

I am a very proud member and volunteer attorney for the ACLU.  Since you have made it your life's work to remain absolutely and completely ignorant about the Constitution, nothing I write here will be absorbed by you.  But others may actually want to learn something.

With very few exceptions - like if Google said they would not host a web site because the owner is black, for instance - Google has no obligation to host any web site for anyone.  You (remarkably) keep making the same First Amendment mistakes you always make here.  The Constitution limits the power of government - not the power of private companies.  If the web site owner was arrested and jailed because of his loathsome views, the ACLU would defend him.  Enjoy marinating in your ignorance."

"As a fan of the Broncos for 47 years, I will no longer support them. I will no longer watch you or buy your jerseys, hats, shoelaces, what have you. You players and coaches and the entire NFL MISSED THE POINT! To protest about police brutality towards blacks in America could be a valid debate. HOWEVER, to kneel during the National Anthem, which has NOTHING to do with police brutality and EVERYTHING to do with the fallen soldiers of this country and the AMERICAN FLAG, is a blatant disrespect to those soldiers, their families (who have a flag folded and given to them by the Honor Guard), the USA, but also to the FANS and millions of everyday AMERICANS who honor these things. You used the wrong format for your protest. You brought politics into a sport. Our one chance to get away from the political mess. You used your platform to trash Trump.

"I could care a less if the good Doctor is a woman or not as long as they can act and wouldn't have commented as I don't know any fans of the Doctor who care either but Tabitha completely lost me with the whole rant on political correctness.  It's a cop out to say that the people who are against it really just want to beat up on blacks, women and gays with impunity.  While I'm sure there are a very small minority of people who feel that way, 95% of us are sick and tired of SJW's telling us how to feel and react to any situation full stop.  To trivialize it by saying we're all racists, bigots or fascists shows a total lack of understanding - which she continued to demonstrate through the rest of her rant on the subject.  It's clear she's not a real fan of the Doctor but used this simply to expound on her silly belief that many people actually mind in this day and age if women are put into positions of power."

"More deflection. Still you can't actually defend Trump. 

Your ""respectfully"" and ""politely"" niceties don't hold much water anymore after you voted for Trump, the racist segregationist sexual predator who has made a career out of disrespecting hard working people who were gullible enough to trust him. You weren't troubled by the fraud of Trump University? How many good people lost money to that crooked scam? You weren't troubled by the fact that small construction firms report that Trump doesn't pay them and either files BKY or tells them ""see you in court""? You weren't troubled by the fact that he uses his power to leer at UNDERAGE girls? You weren't troubled by the fact that he was busted by the DOJ for illegally refusing to rent to black Americans or  steering them to his predominantly black building (aka racial segregation)? You voted for the modern day George Wallace. Save your ""respectfully"" because Trump voters obviously don't understand what respect means."
You could care less whether or not a Black Lives Matter group lives here.  All you care about is stirring the racist pot.  Now crawl back under the rock from whence you came.
"Wait a minute.  Did you say binary?  Does that mean only male or female?  You don't seem to like America.  Most of your comments are negative.

Why do you always accuse people of not living here when we disagree?  Isn't that binary?  I do live here and this is the least racist state I have ever been in.  Unless of course you are a haole trying to return soda bottles for recycling to locals.  

I am frustrated with the state continuing to return the democratic office holders to office without holding them responsible for their actions.  We are ranked bottom third in education, transportation, and government transparency.  We are highest in taxes, cronyism, nepotism.  The middle class is disappearing on their 50 years watch.

I watched the older men drop the n word and 'boy' when talking about blacks.  I don't imagine things.  I witnessed them.  Today is nothing like back then.

Sad when you have to insult the speaker instead of countering his arguments.  BTW, your mom's ugly."

"Boycotted Kaepernick? Surely you have some evidence to support that, right? And presumably you have some other evidence showing that this is about Trump, right?

Obviously his conduct is worth protesting and no doubt some players, coaches, etc are supporting their colleagues precisely because of Trump's inappropriate words and position. But at the heart of it this is about the treatment of blacks in America. Something Trump isn't addressing despite how it's starting him in the face. It's further evidence actually of how uninformed and out of touch he is with his own country.

Trump may be delivering the kind of bombast and empty rhetoric that his supporters expect and feed on but it's a far cry from how a President should be conducting himself. And the irony of you trying to call out others for lying is rich indeed when Trump's record of lies is so easily apparent. And you call others hypocrites. Unbelievable."

"Let's see ABC/ESPN (owned by Disney) broadcast the1946 Disney classic ""Song of the South"" and watch them all go crazy!  These PC idiots will let black people say anything they want with no consequence and get rid of shows like ""Last Man Standing"" that was the 2nd highest rated comedy ABC had for no reason.

ABC should just play shows from the 1950s and 1960s like ""Maverick"", ""77 Sunset Strip"", ""Cheyenne"", ""Hawaiian Eye"", ""Surfside Six"", ""Combat"" and ""The Gallant Men"".  These shows were the blockbusters that made ABC network as popular as NBC and CBS.  Now days, Dancing with the Stars and Bachelor/Bachelorette shows are the best mind numbing waste of time that only idiots watch are broadcast on ABC.  I spend my time watching YouTube's old documentaries from PBS and the BBC during prime time hours, if at all.

"Hey Gerald, I literally posted the words of the guys that founded the KKK. Whatever crowdsourced knowledge you have of the subject means nothing compared to the people that founded it.

You can attempt to move goalposts or walk back what you said, or make it sound like we can't know what you know because reasons, but I have posted direct quotes by those that founded the KKK that refute your idea that it was a mostly anti-carpetbagger movement.

This is not about belief, you are making this an issue of personal choice. I will repost it so maybe you can understand....

"" Dressed up in scary costumes with hoods and masks, members rode about at night threatening and frightening blacks. They demanded that blacks either vote Democrat or not vote at all. They met defiance with beatings, whippings and sometimes murder. They burned blacks’ houses down and drove black farmers off their land....""

You assert they were not as racist as anti-northern. This refutes that. No more goalpost moving."
"For the next four years it will be comatose, but it will regain consciousness and will be passed in time.  Face it, the religious nuts are dying out.  Most young folks today think gay people should have the same rights as anyone else.  As more peop,e openly  declare themselves as nones, agnostics and atheists, they become more angry about the right to discriminate against other Americans using the name of religion.  Denying any person access to public goods or services is evil, even when done from supposedly ""religious"" reasons.  Remember, it wasn't all that long ago Catholics were discriminated against for religious reasons and these supposed ""religious freedom"" laws could bring those days back.  Be careful what you wish for, as these things can easily bite you in the butt."

Don't confuse license with liberty. The xenophobia encouraged by Trump and people like Kellie Leitch has led directly to an alarming increase in attacks on Muslims, Jews, Blacks, and other visible minorities. 

Angela Merkel is not a Leftist. And it seems you  suffer from sinistrophobia. It drives otherwise sane people to say silly things such as Alberta's PCs are ""socialists"" or accuse the G&M of having a leftwing agenda. Free speech is a fine thing, but you shouldn't speak if you're free of ideas."

"Trump's overview, especially the term ""carnage"" was bleak.  But, at least he is confronting the reality.  The city of Chicago for instance has as many murders as France, the latter with 20 times the population.  And, Chicago, while the worst of the horror of the American inner city tragedy is not an outlier.   Places like St. Louis, Baltimore, Detroit and on an on are in the same camp.  To think that America has had a black president who has really done so little for his own people, as he was not disposed to policing.  Trump's prescription is a solid push for law and order.  I sense he is right.  But, I do not see how he can bring this about on his won, as criminal law is a state matter, and policing is a city matter.  So, maybe that leaves him with just the bully pulpit."

"I guess the dead woman had a pregnancy that conservatives didn't think needed saving at any cost. I'm sure they will not complain about the cops conducting an abortion by gun shot. Off course, black lives don't matter to the folks that support the police, right or wrong. Don't take my word for it. Read their posts here. they can always rationalize killing black folks, even in the womb. So much for the morality of pro life movement. Most of them support police shootings of unarmed black people.

"You ignore the fundamental hypocrisy of NAACP that solely and exclusively advocate for blacks or ""colored people"" (the same 19th C. descriptor used in 1909 and continues). The organization has zero to do with any other Americans. The fundamental crux of ""inclusion"" is to embrace other people. Like Pacific-Islanders? Native Americans? Asian-Americans? Hispanic/Latinos? Bi-racial? Multi-racial? Undesignated? Get the picture? 

Are we talking about income inequality, access to education, job opportunities or the like? Oh, only for ""CP""? The U.S. has the lowest social mobility for people in the middle-and-lower economic classes since the first Gilded Age. When the NAACP or La Raza or the like show up for their ""exclusivity"" we all lose. Tens of millions of Americans are mired in poverty and transgenerational poverty. Good thing we only look at their skin tone. I guess that's why the NAACP has offices on NA Reservations or Guam/ASamoa/PR?"
"This is a left wing pipe dream that the blacks came up with years ago as a way to make their 13% of the population more powerful at the ballot box. Thankfully, our constitution is very hard to change and this kind of baloney won't fly."

They did not agree with what he said at all.  They pretty much nailed him as they should.  Doubly so because he nails the conservatives that screw up without question, and with glee.  What goes around, comes around. He violated his own ""PC"" rules, so he should get burned by it.  You can't say the ""House-N"" word without it being racist. There is no rationale that can be permitted on this term.  You know that, you are a smart guy, and I know you do.  It is not self-effacing in any way.  In fact I find that word hard to attach to his remark.  He used the word to get his laugh, at THEIR expense.  So that is why he had to crawl back to them on his show.  He deseved everything that he got, because he calls people all kinds of derogatory names on his show.  I give him no quarter here.  He blew it, 100%."
"The only dangerous part of Florida are the immigrant and black areas. Everywhere else is safe, it's very segregated down there so you know right away when you are in a safe area or a bad one, regardless in Florida the cops respond to any area when called, Belize, Mexico, the law will show up after you are mugged and dead."

"When Philip Rushton  also a psychologist-  published his research on the relationship between IQ  and race he was never forced from his job at Western.

For example  even though he claimed an inverse relationship  between penis size and intelligence - he  continued to publish and teach

 (And indeed conservatives and black people tend to do more poorly on IQ tests - read the Bell Curve for example))

"T-bone, almost everything you post is bleeding heart liberal so I'm not sure why you are scolding me about feeling.  As far as concealed/carry goes, it's good to see that someone has some sense in Chicago.  But that has nothing to do with the liberal policies that enhance the possibility for gang violence and black on black crime."
That report was retracted (probably because it included statistics about black people) but if you aren't willing to admit they're the largest percentage of homicides based on population in Alaska then you're the one who won't look at facts.
"There is a perception that black individuals are being shot without reason. While I am not convinced there is a systemic problem I have seen numerous videos where black men are shot to death and clearly should not have been. That is what the protest and the BLM movement are addressing. 

Regardless of color, lipping off to a cop, refusing to cooperate, being pulled over should not be ""rolling the dice"". If a police officer does something offensive I should not be shot to death for saying so. 

In the cases above, some the people killed were in complete compliance with the law and the demands of the officer and were still shot dead. NONE of them (in the videos I saw) were in any way threatening the life of the cop or anyone else."
"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.
Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.”
Ungrateful is the new uppity.
Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans.
Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of that week but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
13  Black congressmen boycotted Trump inauguration in no small part because he dared mention black  on black murder in Chicago during the election. Black leaders  keep say America needs a dialogue on race relations but run way when it happens.

What was the Vietnam War, the  escalation of the Vietnam War with a fake military incident, the draft of 18 year old kids into the military, police riots, CIA subversion of the peace movement, the police occupation of black ghettos, FBI  subversion of the civil rights movement, FBI infiltration of the Black Panthers, the Kent State shooting of protesters, the secret wars in Cambodia and Laos, the killing of some three million in Southeast Asia...?

"Charles, take that chip off your shoulder and do some research....start will Walter Williams, a very sharp black professor at Geo. Mason U.  Check ""blacks who fought for the confederacy"" (Yes, there were black slaves who fought, but there were also FREE southern blacks).  Slavery was an ""economic"" issue,  as there were free blacks who THEMSELVES owned slaves.  I'm just stating facts.  I'm not the one denying reality, or history.  Blacks fighting for the south did so for their homes, their families and their state.  Maryland, Delaware, Missouri,Kentucky, West VA, and NJ were all slave states and remained in the Union.  Northern slave sales were actually taxed by the IRS beginning (I believe) in 1862 to support the war effort.  It wasn't until 1863 AFTER the Emancipation Proc. that the Union army began accepting blacks.  The ONLY black who fought at Gettysburg was a confederate from Louisiana..who lost an arm at Cemetery Hill.  I KNOW what I'm talking about.  Do your own research!"
"The pot calling the kettle black...

"yes because being the butt of racial jokes from a so-called respected member of your faculty -  a person in a power position, likely having the ability to affect one's life- when one is already constantly beleaguered by racial animus inside and outside that enclave is no big deal.  If its not, then I assume there wont be any more whining on these sites from the privileged class about being described as racists.  We should all just get over it, 'act like adults and move on'-odd definition of 'adult' btw. Do you have a clue how humiliating such a comment might be for that young person? Sessions talked recently about how humiliated he was by his boss and a former colleague pointed out that he should remember that feeling because that's how black people have felt with his treatment them.  I make the same point to you and others making snowflake comments; the next time you experience humiliation/is robbed of your dignity, remind yourself that's how being butt or racial jokes feel."

"Richard, people from ALL over the country came to Obama's inauguration, not just blacks living in DC. The fact that Obama won a second term and left office with a 60% approval rating is an indication of how good a president he was.  Trump is off to a very bad start with only 40% approval, no other president has come into office with numbers so low. We'll see if he even finishes his first term, let alone gets a second.

Not only does he lie, but his press secretary and all the sycophants surrounding him do too. This morning on Meet the Press, Kellyanne Conway tried to spin the low inauguration turnout, by saying the Trump administration has ""alternative facts.""  Chuck Todd was having none of it saying, 

""Alternative facts are not facts. They are falsehoods.""

Maybe so that Cal has been pushing his faith but the problem is that you lumped all Christians into a single sentence of ridicule. If you would have used lets say all people of color would that opinion be a fair judgment in the same context that you judged Christians ?
"""If we compare that to civilian society that I can see, it appears that the motivated ones went into the military and the the rest went into the gangs or the prison population.""

BTW, no quarterback ever sucked more than Colin Kaepernick.  13% of this nation is black.  Of that tiny fraction only a fraction of the 13% are responsible for over 50% of this nations homicides.  Are they protesting that?  Can you imagine if any other ethnicity was responsible for such a statistic?   Fire them all."

Many Black people like Mr. Farrakan, a extremely educated man, one who was immersed early on in the refined areas of society, also an accomplished violinist among many talents, knew this as he sought to free his people from those chains, give them the pride of liberty over their own destiny and future. Mr. Farrakan is a racist in the view of many, but even as a charismatic anti-Semitic, he saw the psychological chains of slavery being put on his people. 
Many Blacks who are not racists arealso now realizing looking at their own people, especially the high murder rate which constitutes the majority of murders in America, the chains of poverty has become not only a means of generational enslavement, but a genocide of their own people, as they speak out."
"As tragic and difficult as this issue is, ostensibly impossible to resolve as the fronts concerned with justice for victims and those concerned with justice for the falsely accused seem unable to even acknowledge the concerns of the other side, I find it intellectually dishonest and simplistic to paint a picture of the old days as a big free for all for rapists. It was anything but; sexual assault has always been disproportionately punished. Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan are the least countries in which you would like to find yourself accused. 

But justice was even more than now tied to your social class. A low status man had no chance against the accusation of a higher status woman - see the black lynchings - and the other way around. And one of the easiest ways for women to lose status was to be ""loose"". Inequality, not misogyny, explains most of the blatant miscarriages of justice in the past."
"Trump isn't putting democracy at risk. You, however, would put republicanism at risk. It was republicanism that the Framers wrote into the constitution, not democracy. The ACA is opposed my most Americans, and was not even understood by the Democrats who pushed it through. Equal rights for the marginalized? In this country, a homeless man is equal before the law to a billionaire, except that if the homeless man is black, he gets affirmative action. Affordable college tuition? Obama promised free college tuition --- on the backs of our children, who'll be paying outrageous tax bills until they die.  What?  Someone told you things like college were free?  You really do believe in Santa Claus. LGBT rights?  Like what? To marry? Use of that word to apply to two men or two women solidifying their union around the act of sahdamy is obscene.  Voting rights? Like the Obama Justice Department refusing to enforce Section 8 of the Voting Rights Act if it didn't impact blacks? And I hate Trump!"
"Wavemaker.....from the video, the two officers definitely didn't have the suspect in any sort of detainment, they were still fighting him when they realized that he was going for a gun.

"Musician Ted Nugent said... that Trump was not unambiguous in his remarks.

“We condemn all violence. That’s what President Trump said. And all lives matter. If you don’t agree with that you’re a racist,” he said.

This position is of course entirely correct. In terms of accuracy, succinctness, spirit and intent, righteousness and morality...

But these fundamentals of course will never do for the left, in terms of actual substance- only in terms of mindless form and blathering. Their newest bobble-headed buzz phrase is ""false equivalence"": translation- ""our thugs are better than theirs"". These hapless progressive boobs see no difference, for example, between the unfortunate embracing of an organization founded by Margaret Sanger and one founded by Adolph Hitler. Look up ""eugenics""- especially as applied to black people. False equivalence indeed. Being low-information individuals is bad enough. Being no-information- and no real principles of integrity- can only lead us to disaster."

"""We do not want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population,"" she said, ""if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."" Woman's Body, Woman's Right: A Social History of Birth Control in America, by Linda Gordon

In an interview with Mike Wallace in 1957, Sanger said, “I think the greatest sin in the world is bringing children into the world, that have disease from their parents, that have no chance in the world to be a human being practically.”

“Delinquents, prisoners, all sorts of things just marked when they’re born. That to me is the greatest sin—that people can—can commit,” she said.  

On blacks, immigrants and indigents:
""...human weeds,' 'reckless breeders,' 'spawning... human beings who never should have been born.""  Margaret Sanger, Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants and poor people.

The purpose in promoting birth control was ""to create a race of thoroughbreds,"" she wrote in the Birth Control Review, Nov. 1921 (p. 2)"
"It's unprofessional. You are not at home on your couch. You are meeting with the Congressional Black Caucus. You are a Senior Advisor for the President and it is an official meeting.

"The NFL will lose a portion of their fan base and a significant portion of potential fans. The NFL players decided that anyone who isn't African-American is just a racist bigot. The NFL players are protesting solely for African-Americans. Oh wait, then it was people of ""color"". Oh wait, then there was blood in the streets and this wasn't their country. NFL players' median salary exceeds $900K but lets protest income inequality?

The NFL has stifled any other free speech because the racist message reflects the ""values"" of the NFL. The NFL allows A-A players to raise fists for ""Black Power"" in the workplace. The A-A NFL players create a racially hostile work environment. Kiz and DP crew are down with institutional bigotry and discrimination that violates the Civil Rights Act. The double-standard and hypocrisy are equally laughable and pathetic."
"Ms. Nussbaum,  I hope that you are aware that it is people like you who chose not to vote for President are the ones who helped elect this terrible man to the presidency.  You are the ones who have permitted the current atmosphere to exist in which people feel empowered to be openly racist and bigoted and to openly threaten people that are perceived as less worthy.  Already there has been a documented number of open verbal attacks and treats on black people, on Mulsims and Latinos.  
I hope that you feel very good in your insulated superiority."

"I'm well aware. In the 1990s, during the Oslo Peace accords, most Israelis bought into the premise of a new world order that accepted them irreversibly as part and parcel of the west. 
When the media campaign of lies began in Oct. 2000, the Israelis were so caught off guard at both the severity and malice and they just weren't prepared to respond to that kind of slander and choreographed propaganda. They wanted to be like Canada and the USA who apologize constantly to Natives and Blacks etc and everything will be OK and they just didn't have a good narrative prepared for themselves; they didn't expect to need it!
Hopefully they will have reckoned with the facts and moved past shallow western constructs into something more genuine.

How could the health outcomes of legalization possibly be any worse than the 2500+ deaths from street opiate/opioid overdoses in 2016? (And nevermind the awful state of many addicts who nonetheless didn't die...)
We now have decades of proof: prohibition is a failed model.
It creates and encourages violent black markets, costs us untold millions in law enforcement and first response expenses, and .. oh yeah .. hasn't done _a thing_ to reduce the rate of drug use or accessibility in North America or anywhere else not run by a homicidal dictator named Duterte.

"Without actually acknowledging the foundation on which laws are based; is racism the reason people use the American flag as crutch? In order to answer my own question, I believe politicians can't handle the truth. Are you Black or African American?  Administrative action questions used on governmental forms describes whitewash with a hidden agenda to target an entire ethnic group. Although the U.S. Constitution relays our rights and privileges as American Citizens; the U.S. Constitution was implemented during  a period where colors lingo were mostly used by Supremacists.

I blame him for his actions.  Not the BLM movement.  Not the police who killed the black men in LA, MN, or any other state.  Not the people who have been talking on social media.  No this is his fault.  I don't care how smart he may have been, he reacted stupidly & put people in danger.  

There's nothing to understand about why he committed these crimes.  It doesn't matter why because the answer is simple ""he believed he was right"". he wasn't.  If officials can't figure that out they aren't any smarter than the avg sheep.

New York - liberal and ignorant... 'Current' numbers have Hillary ahead in Popular vote by less than 50K votes - a joke at best... The Democrats tried hard to rig the campaign - do it every year, do NOT want to have people prove they are citizens - do some checking instead of crying... P.S. Thanks for showing everyone posting here that YOU are a bigot and the 'racist'!"
"I hearing talking and more talking all of the time from our elected officials, but their actions are all together different. Kap talks about fairness and equal justice while wearing ""cops are pigs"" socks, and others raise their black power fist in the air. Bottom line they are racial racists and I have no time for the agenda nor their disrespect for our flag."
"People claiming to be offended by words they don't understand should be laughed out of the place.  This reminds me of the time someone used the word 'niggardly' and some black people complained.
Sane people must reject the idea that offended ignorance should be coddled."
BLM is trying to jump-start the black victim industry in Canada.  This is just another step in that direction.
"You are paranoid, Media focuses on his blackness (race) articles from National Post focus on Jewish donors not happy with Obama regarding UN resolution on Israel.
Jewish donors very angry in the Chicago area. Therefore complain about media giving attention to his racial make up and also take it up with NP and Chicago donors complaining.
Thought Police at work!"
"I'm not gay - or black, or of a religious minority, or any other identifiable target group.
But I do think that the union is trying to stir up trouble."
I understand the history Jefferson davis.  but would somebody please tell me what the hail Obama did for blacks except stoke more racism. .  Even Louis farrakhan in his constant praise for Obama states basically Obama didn't didn't do grass digested  by a cow !!!! but the reason he didn't do anything is because there's nothing to do.  blacka just like everybody else in this country are not living under Jefferson davis law.
Obama most certainly did court BLM and the Black power movement through BOTH campaigns.
Don't you think the Republican party lights up with delight to have a black person to bash and satisfy their base?  its been tough on them not having Obama to run against.  Sooo hard to be accountable.   This sad story is shameful but the Republicans are going to drag it out..... because it fits their schtick.
Promoting blacks in the HPD is brutalizing? How so? You against affirmative action for some reason?
"... who did you vote for Pres?  ""Grab 'em by the p**sy"" ... likely with support of the Russians!

Thanks for proving our point!!  Republicans have ZERO moral compass, only CLAIMS to it.  Rubber ain't hitting the ground AT ALL with Republicans!!!

All you guys do now is boot lick the rich ... drive up the deficit, that only matters when a black man is in office.  Lol ... we're back to 'deficits don't matter' fantasy land."
"Yes, 2016, including tRump the rapist and groper.  At least a dozen women have come forward with credible stories of tRump groping them or attempting to use sex for hire favors in some cases.  A federal prosecutor should grab tRump by his short hairs and nail him to the wall, or toss him back into the deep, dark, black weasel cave that he came from."
"Before jumping to conclusions, do some research on Ian Eisenberg and Omari Tahir-Garrett, both of whom have colorful histories. Eisenberg has a long history of what might be called sleazy capitalist stunts (i.e. ripping off people). He's the stereotypical money-grubbing Jew.

Omari has long represented the black community as an outspoken activist and Seattle School Board candidate. He earned notoriety when he clobbered Mayor Paul Schell with a bullhorn, something I think Omari deserves a gold medal for.

In the meantime, stop using that stupid, meaningless word ""anti-semitism."" When I ran for Governor last year, the first work in my Voters Pamphlet statement was ""Jewarchy.""  Google it."
"My guess(educated)... the young black man/men sometimes have trouble assimilating into the island way of things. A gang banger won't get much respect on the street from local types especially south pacific islanders with the same skin tone. I'm thinking the young black man was disrespected recently, and was forced to retreat because numbers were not on his side. He returns to the scene, with an AR, and randomly fires into a crowd, most of which probably had nothing to do with the shooter's current mood. Typical behavior of an east coast city cretin. Cowardly weasel move. Some people should not be allowed to breed."
"NFL = disrespectful, mostly black men airing their contempt for the USA by kneeling during our National Anthem. Personally, I stand for the flag but kneel for the cross."
"yep, they just hated that the black guy and the Democrats passed something."
"Xenophobia? 

We're not afraid of the Chinese, we are not afraid of the Japanese, we're not afraid of the Romanians, we're not afraid of the Pomeranians, we're not afraid of the Irish, English, German, or Africans. We're afraid of fundamentalist Muslims."
"This sickening beating is definitely a hate crime and since the victim is mentally disabled, he was kidnapped. Whoever is involved sure need to be charged with attempted murder, and from what the article said, yes the perpetrators were black. It doesn't matter what color skin we have or what race we belong to, a beating is a beating and a hate crime is a hate crime."
"Granny Mao's plans are coming down. Obama is now exposed, and to save the legacy of the first black POTUS, Hillary will be sacrificed!"
"""an extradition treaty would commit Canada to transferring fugitive Chinese officials to a country known for biased courts and harsh interrogation methods – and where the death penalty can be imposed even for non-violent crimes.""
Translation:  Canada aspires to become a safe haven for any and all criminals from any country we don't like, depending on the flavour of government we have in Ottawa.
But if 'prejudicial treatment' is such a big no-no, why are we extraditing anybody to the US? They have the death penalty, they use 'harsh interrogation methods', operate 'black sites' commit extrajudicial killings, still they snap their fingers and we jump.
Hypocrisy is at its best."
"What has Trump done to help black people?

You can't accuse the Clintons unless your guy beats them.  So please share what he's done that's so much better."
"Yes we should be free to criticize Robert Mugabe, and I would be one of the first to do so, but that criticism should be based on his appalling record not the fact that he is black."
"The irony is stunning.
99% of the posters think BLM has no business making themselves heard. 

This from a society where your largest minority has to appeal to the United Nations to have their human rights respected by their own government.

Where hate crimes against minorities are committed at a rate twice as high as in the U.S.

Where the group making up only 4% of the general population makes up 25% of the prison population, a rate far in excess of blacks in the U.S.

Where kids are killing themselves by overdosing on drugs at a rate twice the murder rate of NY.

The only reason to have this post deleted or even give thumbs down is because you don't like reading it."
"I replied to all the nonsense in your Slate post.  I am not real crazy about Josh Marquis, overall, but I agree with his position quoted in Slate.  Here is a re-print of my response in case you missed it.

""I have to agree with most of the decisions and positions of those prosecutors cited in the article.
The US Supreme Court has upheld our Jury system numerous times and our death penalty standards as well.
The number of convicted black people is pretty much equal to the number of black people committing the crimes. And most of those crimes are against other black people, from drive-bys where six year old girls are killed, multiple murders and assaults outside strip joints and gang fights over drugs and prostitution. to just cover this year's Portland crime scene."""
"So in this case, ""compromise"" means liberty for the baker, not for the customer. In other words, as I said, liberty for me, not for thee.

Given that the baker's idea of ""religious liberty"" means ""the liberty to discriminate against gays""; I would say that the Christian religion, which does NOT say ""love your neighbor, unless that neighbor is LGBT"", would call on him to serve the customer.

I believe that to practice arbitrary discrimination is a far greater sin than being homosexual. I see no difference whatsoever between a baker who would not bake for blacks and one who would not bake for gays. Both are perverting the Christian religion by claiming that their ""religious liberty"" would be damaged by doing so. Both bakers are bigots, ""justifying"" their bigotry in the name of religion."
"Comparing LGBTQ rights to what blacks went through 60 years ago is way beyond laughable. Please show me a LGBTQ public water-fountain, restaurant table, bus seat, playground equipment and so on."
"And, so it seems from my readings from the Jewish Bible, which Catholics fondly refer to as the Old Testament;  prophet's prophesies are 'doomsday' warnings if God's ways are not adhered to, disobedience to his commands persist, following disasters will fall upon you.  Now, is Trump on the list of forecasted warnings...is there such a specie as a 'Catholic prophet'...that I would like to know about."
"There are too many errors in your assertions to address them all individually, and the war ended over 152 years ago.  You might want to reread the article with a heart for reconciliation rather than so much hatred for a society vastly different from ours today who had to survive and who believed that slavery would end in God's good time.  

New York (named after the most prosperous slave owner and trader in American history) was the last Northern state to end slavery, but slave ships sailed from Northern ports and continued to do so even after the Civil War ended, hauling slaves sold by blacks and Muslims in Africa all over the world.  Do a bit of research and find out when Grant finally was forced to free his slaves after slavery was outlawed.  He excused his delay by saying, ""I kept them because good help is hard to find.""

Having been raised by a wonderful black lady who looked just like Aunt Jemima while my parents both worked, I was blessed to learn that history from her side."
South Africa had a huge fear of communism. Calvinism vs communism. But did the blacks really have a fear for communism as well? I don't believe that.
"You will get no argument from me, other than a request to apply perspective. Those that died on both sides of the SA colonialist project opposed each other in their objectives - an internecine warfare, no different to the 20000 who died in the Zimbabwe altercation between Mugabe and Nkomo in the 1980's, or the equivalent death toll in KZN between the Zulu's aligned to either the IFP or ANC leading up to 1994. 
The perspective to be applied is the scale and depth of the massacre of European Jews - a people who were unarmed and at war with no-one at the time. 
If anything, black South Africans should identify more strongly with the Jews, as we were once the 'kaffirs' of Europe, more closely aligned to their own vile treatment by the colonialist enterprise."
"If Colorado would allow school vouchers, which is a real possibility now thanks to Trump voters, a school that focuses on the needs of black students could be formed and the parents of black students could use a voucher to send their kids to that school, or they could choose to send their kids to a school for mathematically gifted children or any number of other choices. Right now, the choices are VERY limited thanks to Democrats and teacher unions wanting to maintain the status quo."
""" black entrepreneurs, who will take 14%, employees, 8%, and communities, 8%""
Does this mean black employees and black communities?
For once I agree with the corrupt ANC . The minerals belong to all South Africans, for this reason the mining industry is a special case for regulation, the mining companies should only receive a profit on the act of extraction of our property. For stability in the industry the charter should included the time period over which this rules will apply."
"""Black man"" is a poor description. Why is the name of the race forbidden? There is more traits to a race than color of the skin. And racial differences in the murder rate are huge."
"Maybe the flag represents a country that disrespects black lives. How's that? 

In that case, we all should be taking a knee during ""The Star Spangled Banner.""

That's why we have free speech; to help our nation become a ""more perfect union""."
"Update: Deleted and updated to include the following:  what's important to ask is who the *heroes* are.  Look at the Clinton/Soros-funded BLM movement. They're a hate group that terrorizes innocent lives, businesses, and communities.  Why does the black community have a 71% single mother rate? Why do they commit a staggeringly-disproportionate amount of crime?  At a time when integration and desegregation have made such great strides, why is this community still so ravaged by war with itself and with others?  *'Black_Dude'* is clearly a model and a hero for his family.  That should be the point: I ""lump him together"" with those who are making their communities *better,* not worse."
"Trump may very well be changed by the responsibilities of the office of President, and he will grow into the job.  Maybe his ego will make him want to be loved by everyone, and he will act accordingly, although that is unlikely with the advisors he is gathering around himself.  But it is absolutely certain that the hatred he sowed among his supporters during the campaign will continue to grow.  It has already begun with the celebrations in many rural areas, the attacks on Blacks and Latinos, and the rhetoric shouted on the street."
"-  -  -  -  or the Men in Blue,  or the Black population in Chicago,  or the 'bitter clingers', or the Little Sisters of the Poor -  ???"
Need a citation about how they were brainwashed. Or do you think they exalt when cops kill unarmed blacks?
"In the picture of the children's Mass, there is a black boy right in the center."
"What racism?   

Surely if there is so much racism toward Blacks in American, you can give me a specific example.

What is it?

After you fail to do so, maybe you can reflect that you have no need to feel saddened."
No mention of 750 murdered  black males in Chicago alone  in  2016.
"I subscribe to NCR primarily to learn about Catholic or Christian-related events.  This is especially so for international events.  However, all but 3 of the articles listed have no obvious connection to Christian events and provide information I can easily get elsewhere.  I would really like to see the international briefing focus on church-related events such as the persecution of Christians abroad or positive developments in the African, Asian and Latin American churches."
"It's not difficult to figure out: a production in 2017 will seek relevance in 2017, not in 1962 or 1992.

I understand that what Trump ""mutters"" is minor stuff for you.  It's not minor for women.  Especially given the fact that Trump is currently the most powerful person in the world, and the fact that so many people, especially men, make excuses for him and what he says.

Of course what he says and does isn't the same thing as the sexual slavery Atwood wrote about.  Neither was the United States in 1985 when Atwood wrote it.  It was a warning then . . .  and it's a warning now."
"Sigh. Still missing the point, eh bav? They aren't protesting Trump's behaviour. They are protesting the treatment of black Americans.

And Trumps bahaviour is far worse than not politically correct. It's juvenile, narrow minded, and completely misses the point of the protests. There are far more appropriate ways of responding. Even Paul Ryan looks better than Trump does on this issue."
"""On election night in 2008, like many Americans, I was overjoyed that our nation had overcome its historic racism sufficiently to elect our first black president.""

Barack Obama was elected because George W. Bush was the worst president in American history.  It is no surprise that deep seated racism slithered out of the sewer of American history to oppose him.  Now it has elected its own president."
"Bravo to a 13-year-old writer brave and talented enough to submit her thoughts to the scrutiny of these boards....

... but I will comment on her framing the matter of racism as somehow a matter that one might not understand due to living in a ""privileged environment"" such as a particular neighbourhood in Seattle.

A child invoking the term ""privilege"" so early on in the framing of her argument is troubling. It appears clear (and saddening) that those who have educated her, at this young age, have managed to instill the mindset that privilege is the key to the ethnic/racial tensions in society. And surely applauding that perspective would be Black Lives Matter, who invoke it routinely.

I doubt young children are armed to say back to a teacher, ""I reject your focus on privilege because your privilege-focus overlooks much and is damagingly maladaptive to those embracing it"". And so they embrace the new scripture, young, and a new proselytization replaces religion in education."
"How would like to be a cop right now? 
Isn't it odd how the press talks about the poor black man who was in the middle of changing his life around got shot and killed by a cop after robbing a liquor store?

I like it when the parents get on camera and talk how their kid was a perfect angle, wouldn't hurt a fly,
even though they have a rap sheet longer than your arm. 

Have any idea how many cops were killed this year, don't know do you. CNN won't talk about it because it doesn't generate ratings. Look how much revenue they got out of the Trayvon Martin story, they made bank! Trayvon was over 6' tall with gang tats all over his arms and chest, won't hear that on CNN.."
"OMG...You are so far off! Racism is Not the reason Trump was Elected. Would you say Racism elected Obama? Of course not-it was the open generous heart of the American people saying: ""Hmmm... well let's give him a chance""... Having a Black President may help bring us all together"". It was based on his (professed) policies and statements of ""inclusion"" and ""Openness and Transparency."" None of what we got."
Could it be that it is Segal who should be the one under scrutiny if he is given the title Master and then sits down with black students. If one of the black students addressed him with that title can you imagine the outrage.
I'm not the one boasting of going to confession.
"Why, wasn't that your folk's major objection to President Obama? He committed the crime of Presidency while black?"
"GBA:  new poster or new moniker?   the statement you reference is in a different post than the one I responded to.......The issue of ""Black racism"" is complex and, IMO, i results from years of feeling personally impacted by racism and discrimination based on one's race.....I feel it's a reaction.  I don't offer this as a ""justification"" but as a explanation helpful to undersanding the feelings of many African Americans.

I think we'd all benefit from a civil conversation regarding this topic...a face-to-face conversation involving persons of all different races.  Wouldn't likely be a ""walk in the park"", but it could really help us understand each other."
Are you saying that Shurtz's action didn't offend any young black young people???
"Free speech protects protests from Nazis and from black lives matters not just one political agenda.  All nuts are covered!  I didn't mention anything about the ones screaming fire or threatening to bomb someone, i am talking about free speech and if someone has the right to say they hate police and that it is okay to kill police then it is alright for a crazy group like the KKK to voice their opinions."
"Oh Geraldine, would that the Founding Fathers had conceived of such a group as ""business owners"" and understood their need for protection!

Civil rights protect IMMUTABLE characteristics. Choosing to become a business owner is the choice to accept public accommodation. You can't choose to be black. You can't choose to be female. But you have all the choice in the world whether you wish to engage in the grubbiness of public commerce. 

(What an insult to those who have suffered -- even died -- for the right to worship according to their own conscience to sully their memory with some cockamamie insistence that worshiping Mammon is worshiping God! Blasphemy.)

BTW - there is no ""gay wedding cake"" anything. There's just a wedding cake. Mr. Phillips has a right to withhold ""expressive intent"" (that's inherently a very narrow matter) but he cannot just refuse to sell wedding cakes to whole classes of people."
"The obamas and clintons have as their preceding democrats, promised the blacks  and the Hispanics the moon. They are in the same boat they have been for a 100 years, gained nothing. The republicans promise nothing and expect those people to
Sieze the same opportunities that everyone else does. You don't see anyone pandering to the Asians and the phillipinos, nor the other imigrants. Wonder why? You should. No, it's a tired demo line that needs to go, these people getting promised all that free stuff need to wake up. YOU HAVE BEEN PLAYED."
"Read it in the same sociology class at about the same time, I believe.  

Of course, by then, I had already left honky Oregon and spent four years in the Air Force with diverse members of US society who were, even then, judged mainly on results instead of primarily on ethnicity.

Had black peers, subordinates and superiors.  

Meritocracy was the stated goal; even if it didn't succeed 100%.  Nothing ever does."
Destroying the Alaskan economy at the onset of what will be the largest recession in state history.......that's not a plan.....that's intentional debt slavery for this state.  taking anything from the PFD is taxation.  Making new income tax is taxation.  These will accelrate the disaster to come and compound its damage which will be substantial.  Hang on for the ride..
"After the 30th with the requirement to have 60 votes to break a democratic filibuster the congress will have to actually work together to FIX the ACA, rather than this partisan circus of anti-Obama efforts that have achieved nothing and costs millions. The republicans have had everything in their favor to repeal or replace and they have produced nothing that even their majority can agree on, it is a travesty of greed, self-service and vitriol against a black president; if the plan was good they could have passed it by virtue of majority and the special rule they made for themselves. This is how poorly the republicans design, and execute their policies. The ACA is a good change, it could have been better if the republicans hadn't messed it up and luckily we have senators like Michael Bennet, who actually seek what is best for the American people."
"Well telling the truth isn't racist, deportation for illegals is following the law... Building a wall keeps us safe....refusing to rent to blacks is a new one... Your probably not a person who pays taxes, have to keep that obummer phone."
Non violent. BLM false. They are very violent and are responsible for numerous attacks on police officers as well as non black citizens.
"(cont.)

I think Brown stands, for many of us, as a great achievement. We like to think that the moment those children made it through the mobs and into the school, something was set right. The actual fallout of Brown, with respect to primary and secondary education for Black children, has not been good. ""Separate and unequal"" describes the conditions of education for a large proportion of Black children, and so the means to prepare for college are significantly lacking, and so while avenues of advancement are nominally open, they are not open effectively, except, for the most part, for those Black people who were comparatively privileged to begin with. After a brief bubble of increased Black presence in higher education, the numbers have been tapering off for decades. Again, I'd refer you to Anderson's book, where the matter is dealt with in some detail."
"@Sphere Music.  You assume there was qualified black individuals out of the 39% of the population? You have to first be a working lawyer to qualify to be appointed to the federal courts.  You are saying Sessions should appoint a black person with no qualifications over anyone else?  If you don't know the numbers, you should not be criticizing. 3 Black people over what time constituting how many positions? How many qualified candidates were considered?  Were the appointees that were picked qualified for the job.  Was there even any blacks in the running each time?  Can you answer all these questions? Otherwise your statement means nothing."
"Yup, pretty much like various defacement of MLK statues and black churches around the country, presumably by right extremists who's ends also justify their means"
"In the negative stereotyping of blacks, the media are complicit. They mostly show us blacks in conflict with the law. There's more to black lives than that, but it's invisible in the media. Being wrongly suspected hurts, especially when it is the actions of a few which cause that suspicion. Instead of blaming the police for trying to do their job, blame the people whose behaviour damages the community's reputation. 
No one has proven a significant rate of false convictions. So the solution to disproportionate incarceration rates for some minorities is not less policing but less lawbreaking. Community activists should explore what is needed to help their brothers obey the laws."
The only good thing about Trump is that university students studying political science will  end up with a bonus degree in psychiatry................
"Agreed. Why the Honolulu Star-Advertiser and other news media are turning a blind eye to the glaring weakness in UH football is a head-scratcher. Someone needs to have the guts to just straight up ask Rolo the million dollar question: Is the defensive coordinator qualified for the job? Norm Chow was fired mid-season — and he was the HEAD coach. Chris Naeole may be the one who resigned, but offense is NOT the main problem!"
"Good thing nobody relies on you for accurate information, macadoo.  People like you that hate our classy president because he's black don't have any reason to say something ethical or polite.  You chose to turn your listening ears off when our classy president:  saved the nation from going over the Republicans fiscal cliff, saved the auto industry and millions of families from going bankrupt and losing their jobs, gave the order to kill Bin Laden, signed into law the Affordable Care Act while you Republicans sat on your butts mounting a Just Say No against our president because he's black and classy."
"As many have pointed out, Congressional Republicans wanted to abandon the auto industry and opposed all stimulus. Without congressional Democrats and Obama's leadership we would have entered a prolonged, deepening recession. The only reason we didn't  have a quick recovery is that for the first time since the Great Depression Congress didn't allow or enact direct stimulus to create jobs, which would also have left us, at this time, with a far lower national debt.

The ACA did in fact stop the previous annual double-digit inflation in insurance premiums, and the gradual and increasing inflation has only happened recently. ACA could not have passed Congress without removal of bargaining rights for pharmaceuticals as part of the regulations.

You are right, it was time for the US to have a Black president, or a woman president, or an Hispanic president, or in fact, any decent president."
"Rogers and Hammerstein works aren't hundreds of years  old, representing ancient traditions now obsolete. My point isn't that we need to live and die by our traditions, simply that this role isn't predicated on the Asianness of the performer; most companies have seemed to simply put in some ""ethnic"" performer. To my mind its almost worse, to act like just any Asian or black or latina will do to replace an ethnicity and its unique experiences in that time, place and social context. Some notable productions have gender swapped with a firm intention to subvert expectation, but to cast a Korean or a Japanese in a Philipino or Vietnamese role and declare it to be an adequate representation of a specific ethnic experience is somewhat distasteful all on its own. If we must be so specific as to cast the right ethnicity, I welcome you to point out the large quantity of Tonkinese-Canadian opera singers that must surely exist in this country."
"Regarding your schadenfreude at people who ""don't comply with police instructions . . . "", what can I possibly say?   Good for you?   I have no idea how to respond to that.   Nothing like superficial framing lacking any measurable context loaded with emotional value-laden BS, is there?

I find the entire practice of overbooking to be more than questionable.  I agree with black dude, and the people at United took zero responsibility for the fact they created a situation that routinely requires someone's travel, and very likely someone's work, and possibly someone's life to be disrupted, sometimes quite seriously disrupted, even damaged.   They took zero responsibility for creating the mess in the first place, and I find the fact that they were indifferent to the individual's own professional and personal needs to be morally reprehensible.  

But we aren't where we are - having trashed the entire planet - because human beings are so good and so smart."
"First off it is not true that the country disrespects black lives.  It might have been true in the past, but it is not currently true.     Second, why are there so many that are willingly fighting and have so willingly fought for this country."
"In this context, of course it is. Kaepernick's own statements reflect his intent... that he would not stand to honor a country that treats blacks the way this country does. If it wasn't intended as calculated disrespect, it wouldn't be much of a protest, now would it?"
What does BLM have to do with this? BLM does not condone violence. They NEVER have. How about the cops the shoot minorities for no apparent reason. Like the recent shooting of a black man in Georgia.  That cop has been charged with murder. There are many more that should have been charged.
"Stuff and nonsense - ""as always.""

I am not the one continuously indicating that the vast majority of ""uneducated"" voters voted for Mr. Trump.  I am not the one who continuously says the black and Latino persons in our country are not afforded educational opportunities.  Both statements come from ""your"" side of the aisle.  But we are used to double-speak from there.....

I AM the one who says the Democrats ignored their base in this election - I guess figuring they were in the bag.  Guess they got quite an education, don't you think?"

"He clearly is living in his own world and knows nothing of what ""progressives"" drink. Chardonnay, really? 


As to black-on-black violence (or any other group-on-group), that is a different subject than police-on-people violence. If that distinction can't be seen, it's really hard to stay on topic, as the guidelines for this site recommend. There is a difference between dissing a topic and trying to stay on one topic at a time, yes?"
"""The New Jim Crow"" by Michelle Alexander would enlighten the unaware readers regarding why BLM has these planks in their platform.  The book outlines how zero tolerance policies, ""check the box"" requirements and emphasis on law and order are selectively applied to African Americans, and have devastated employment prospects and economic enfranchisement of the black community."
"And if the mother left with the man incapacitated and unaware of his assigned responsibility, it makes great sense that he is charged and she gets off scot free."
"I understand that respectfully CADE. We as Americans no longer are to believe ""Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country"", as John Kennedy put it during his inaugural address. Today, it's all about ""What has my country done for me lately?""! Seems for these millionaire NFL players, and the NFL, which makes billions and which receives huge breaks and exceptions from our government that most corporations could only envy, apparently not enough!



Unlike Joe Louis, a man who an entire nation looked up as he took on Hitler's finest, a black man who endure much more racism that these NFL players will ever see, we won't have to worry about these NFL players being buried in Arlington Cemetery, they gave nothing even close to what Mr. Louis gave and believed when it came to America."
"Rookie posters forget, ""All told, at least 12 chief executives—over a quarter of all American presidents—were slave owners during their lifetimes. Of these, eight held slaves while in office.""

"Believe it or not I think you're partly right.  If you'd left out ""And black privilege is very evident in UO athletics, is it not?"" you'd have been all right.  But with your last baiting of your ideological opponents you push things so far that you lose all validity."
How do black people age so well?  With a bit of hair dye OJ could pass for 50.

"Let me assist you. It was by Karl Rahner, given in his address at an American University on the occasion of his 72nd (I think) birthday. His speech was entitled ""A courageous, new, worldwide theology."" It is set out in full at the end of Richard P McBrien's book, 'Catholicism.'

"Eddy Black.  There is a much easier solution.  If people stop buying illegal opioids/heroin the dealers will go somewhere else.

"I'm worried about:
1. Teachers and management at private schools being vulnerable to inappropriate meddling by wealthy parents.
2. Due process being brushed aside by opportunistic policitians.
3. A punitive approach to racists, who need re-education in the spirit of Nation Building, rather than isolation and rejection.
4. Second class education, especially maths education, that's still dished up to black children by the Gauteng Education department which is far more damaging to black advancement than racist language or ideation by a very small minority of teachers, and which doesn't get anywhere near the same attention by the social and formal media."

"The rationale I'm reading from this author and commenters is truly astounding. 

Gays and blacks feel the need to protest their historically documented abusive and non-constitutional  treatment at the hands of police. That is their democratic and constitutionally protected right.

And these commenters are saying, they have no right to protest, and police should now react with retribution by violating their oath to the constitution...again....by withholding policing services, for being excluded from the parade in  protest against this protest move.

All police have to do is, acknowledge their on-going legacy in this regard, apologize for their violations of the constitution, make retribution, and present a go -forward plan to drop the bigotry against gays, blacks and women.

"_""Paul, when you post such hostile statements as 'We have a completely deaf mayor” you lose credibility with a lot of us.'""_ - Douglas Card

Therein lies the problem. 

I've had a good window into Piercy's behavior; and as we're all familiar with, she consistently expresses concepts such as ""inclusive,"" ""consensus,"" etc.

But the bounds around how she will act are very narrow. If you don't mostly agree with her intuitive, usually fact-free, opinion, she will ignore you. Worse, she'll run over you, as she has done repeatedly, most egregiously with the Olive Plaza folks.
 
You may prefer not to hear the bad news that we have a ""progressive"" mayor who would act  so badly, because ""deaf"" is _such_ a ""hostile"" term.

But there are hundreds of people I've worked with who've seen the real Piercy and would express much more ""hostile"" (but accurate) terms for her. My credibility is well enough established that I don't worry much if expressing the unvarnished truth puts off a few folks.

"The reason for targetting black drivers was obvious: they are less likely to have lawyers (that this led to it having racist outcomes is a definitely true fact, even if it's unlikely the motivation was race-hatred [the main enforcer of the scheme was himself black]). 

There is an on-going court case over that, and it seems likely that the town will be be slapped severely enough to stop this method of revenue generation - but it took many years to get this far.

So yes, we should move police authority to the local (or possibly provincial) government level, but in doing so we must take care to preserve critical oversight systems - and possibly even avoid localising them at all. It may actually make sense with local-run police to keep IPID as a national-level organisation - which all of them are accountable to."

"Is Alaska and are Alaska Natives better off as part of the United States?  If the answer to that question is yes, then a statue honoring the man who made it possible seems fitting. And while Natives undoubtedly suffered from racial discrimination over the years, and in some instances still do, they have also benefitted from laws that recognize their rights (ANCSA) and programs enacted to meet their needs -- Native hospitals and investments in village schools, water and sewer systems.   Bennie Benson, a Native, designed the state flag. It should also be noted that the Alaska purchase was a small part of Seward's career which is distinguished by his lifelong efforts to eradicate the oppression of blacks (slavery) and his major role in preserving the nation during the Civil War.  On balance, I think he deserves a statute. But if denied, the next time I visit Alaska I can travel to Seward on July 4."

My daughter uses black crayons at home (because sometimes you just need to draw a black cat or a spider!) and reads chapter books (she's 8 years old). She has celebrated Rosh Hashanah before because a couple students in her class are Jewish and the parents wanted to bring in latkes for everyone, and it's really a very multicultural and tolerant place where all the world's faith traditions are learned about. In my experience it is very forward-thinking in that regard. Our daughter is happy there and learning lots—intellectually, socially, physically. It's a good place :)"

Black issues are not the same now as they were in the late 50's.   That doesn't mean that racism has disappeared.  Black American's still face daily prejudice in all social/economic strata.

Women were not allowed full voting rights at the end of WWI.

Were US troops sent to Vietnam so that Americans could be free to send letters to the editor?

Is protecting freedom of speech even part of training scenarios?

Im sure the same argument about why choose to eat somewhere where the people there dont want to serve you was used for when Blacks were trying to gain equal rights as well.  The point was not that they did not have access to the same types of things elsewhere - it was that they should not need to go to another store to buy the exact same product just because of the color of their skin.  Choosing not to serve someone because of the fact they are gay, is not really any differnet."

I hope the leaders of the Roman Catholic Church are listening.  It is really difficult for those indoctrinated with the Adam and Eve story, where woman is an accessory to a man from the beginning, to unlearn that myth and see the wholeness of God's Redemptive Plan, by accepting the more likely scenario as also found in the Book of Genesis, where God created woman and man at the same time and as EQUALS IN GOD'S IMAGE!

"It's important to remember that Spanish treatment of American native laborers was so bad that one early 16th-century observer,   Bartolomeo De Las Casas, argued for the importation of African slaves as a REFORM! Read his treatise ""A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies"" to get an idea of why Columbus seems so repulsive to us now. The destruction of America, both its peoples and biome, BEGINS w/him.

Conversely, Las Casas later recanted his support for ALL forms of slavery and can be called the first modern human rights activist. In other words, it can be said that the modern concept of human rights advocacy--advocacy grounded in a critique of inequitable power relations--begins as a reaction AGAINST Columbus and his ""discovery"" of America.

"No, it doesn't. Take the sentence apart. If it stopped at ""I'm sorry"" then fine. Adding the ""you"" makes the person expressing a position the subject, removing the actual content of the complaint from consideration and placing the onus back on the one doing the expressing. In popular vernacular it's called a fauxpology. It's derogatory and disingenuous.  It's especially so, like in this case, where a black man is being told his experience isn't his experience rather just a way he feels about his experience (and isn't that too bad for him) and therefore totally discounts and disrespects his humanity. Empathy is when you can feel what the other person feels and is often mistaken for sympathy which is having a sense of compassion for the other person's experience."

"Denise Balkisoon seems to think it more significant that a distant ancestor of Harry’s mom supported the African slave trade than that Harry’s mom walked through an Angolan minefield to draw attention to the horrible loss of life to mines in that wartorn African country. Her column seems to be based on the precept: “the apple doesn’t fall far from the tree” but doesn’t that mean Harry should be a lot more like Princess Diana than like Charles the whatever? Not sure why so many writers of South Asian extraction in the Anglosphere seem to be so heavily involved in identity politics, but it certainly is noticeable, and tiresome. La Balkisoon should find better things to write about."
"I am not addressing this specific point directly but I can say, being from the deep south with memories of the Jim Crow days that in Catholic areas African Americans were treated much better than in the  Protestant areas. Still are.

The Washington DC area (Georgetown)  was southern pre-Civil war. Slavery had a place for and could usually carry the marginal non-productive people before the welfare state. This issue is not as one-dimensional as you are lead to believe."
"Here is something from black history, a black man by the name of William Ellison was the largest plantation owner in South Carolina in 1860 and owned 40 slaves.  Did you know that there were blacks fighting with the South against the North before the blacks join the north in 1864 and Lee and southern troops from beginning of the war till the end said they were not fighting to keep slavery they were fighting for there own countries that left the north, so that plaque is right the southern soldiers were not fighting to keep slavery."
"The columnist is unhelpfully vague when she uses the word ""telling"", where she writes:

""British actor Mark Rylance made a few telling comments about the ways in which supporting actors actually often play in opposition to main characters and that OPPOSING WITHOUT HATING seems to be something women are particularly good at.""

I dunno, could the good Mr. Rylance's words not equally well be applied to many of the loud men in the Toronto and Vancouver chapters of ""Black Lives Matter"" and their ongoing crusades against the police?

In other words, is it really that ""telling"", the assumed boundaries of Mr. Rylance's verbal applicability?"

"I fear that he and many bishops think that once the abuse stops....""

But which church will be affected by this breach? The European Church? The Latin American? The African? The Asian? What part of Europe? Which segment? What dioceses in the US? Which segment of the US church? I think the receptivity/degree of receptivity of these different churches/regions/dioceses/ cultures/constituencies of the church (to the clergy abuse crisis) will differ as their solutions or ""solution-ism"" will differ. The crisis has less weight (or more) in some countries than in others. Then you have the polity, as it were, of the CC incarnated in national conferences of bishops, dioceses, canon law, the Holy See, individual bishops (almost 6,000 of them), etc. In all this, it is hard to ascribe one particular view or position or solution to Francis, especially as he looks at the church through the prism of the church's shortcomings and leadership failures. I pray for him and just focus on the US church."
"Forgive them Lord for they know not what they do.

Video of the protests showed very few blacks and no dress noticeable muslims.
Clinton got 95 % of the black female vote and 68 % of the latino.

Its telling that these two groups were not significant participants in these protest marches.
Visual parsing shows that these were predominantly upper class females who could afford to travel to Washington where Trump only got 4 % of the vote.

Another very telling statistic.
Trump got  42 % of the female vote compared to Clinton at 54 %.

This is a typical gender based expectation.
But, among while female votes, Trump got 58 %.

These stats show that these protests were exclusively from the Democrat/ liberal elites.
This group has done very well under Obama,( doubling their share of national wealth )  with the lower 50 % being left with most of the debt .

Which is why Trump got elected"

I believe we should be targeting our assistance where it will really help those who are willing to help themselves.  Additionally, there is, I believe, a population of folks among the homeless who need supportive living placement.  I refer here to the mentally-ill, developmentally disabled, physically disabled, vets with PTSD , etc.    The substance addicted and chronic alcoholics do need support...usually a residential treatment program....if they're to change their lives.

Who are those who you refer to as not getting help?  What kinds of help would you propose? and how do you feel about those other sub-sets of the homeless?

"Excuse me but is not the fact of the Obama administration--the first black President--who choose and presided over the most diverse administration in US history--was this phenomenon not the result of ""influence by the left"" on the Democratic party? I can prove the party has been historically influenced by the left in many instances whereas you would not be able to support your claim that it never has been. 
To the extent the Clintons have embraced conservative economic policies it is a function of their utility--that is--getting elected. In an political atmosphere such as currently prevails in the US congress--where Republicans have tried time and again to eliminate food stamps, eliminate the earned-income tax credit and various other attacks on the poor and middle class--where is the space for Bernie-style socialism? We barely got Obamacare. Would you be willing to bet your worldly possessions on Sanders' ability to accomplish what he claims he will?  I doubt it."
"Salman Abedi, Khalid Masood, and Khuram each speak to the necessity of implementing the Prevention of Terrorism Act when a person exhibits radical Islamic tendencies.

Abedi was filmed worshipping a large black Daesh flag in Regent's Park and like Masood and Khuram was known to spout radical Islamic propaganda and attend services at radical Islamic mosques.

When persons behave like this, then they need to be taken into custody, investigated interrogated intensively;  if there is probable cause, then they need to have a hearing to determine whether or not to jail and/or deport them.

The security services must act forcefully because there is simply not enough manpower to watch closely all of the suspected radical Islamists.  If there are reasonable grounds, as noted above, to suspect that a person has been radicalized then he/she needs to be taken into custody forthwith.  It is not a perfect solution.  But it is the best solution.

Do you have solutions to this problem?

Thanks, Nigel."

"There have been those who actually looked at facts, rather than simply writing articles, and found that many of the tired old Republican ideas such as taxes, regulations and foreign policy actually matter to most people.  You are correct that the Republican Party was given a black eye in the form of Donald Trump but only time will tell what will actually be accomplished.
Washington and the Media are pretty much the only ones who actually care about gender, race, color and creed.  In the real world men and women work together and either earn their stripes or not.  Economic opportunity often is blocked by restrictive education requirements that can only be obtained from expensive colleges and provide little of value.
Once you have obtained that education and get to work you are blocked by quotas and regulations.  Look at the Pot Stores in Anchorage that are still waiting for approval.  In the meantime they are investing cold cash into rent, renovations, etc."

She said it was ""all about jobs and Trump even though he was a real estate businessman in New York took the time to come to Michigan and address that"".  She further said that the Democrats neglected to listen to the concerns of the average voter.  Van Jones' ""whitelash"" racial biased meltdown on election night, Lewis' illegitimate president statement and op-eds like this do little to bring Americans together, something this woman in Michigan told Holt is needed.....and jobs."

"No internet or shared public information on criminal backgrounds, but vocation directors in the 1980's did ask probing questions about personal history, faith formation, sacraments, church attendance, family, schooling, sexual history, dating, employment etc. during the interview process.  These also came up during the course of hours and hours of spiritual direction in seminary.  If he simply chose to withhold this information from those charged with his admission to seminary and formation, there is a problem because those who called him to holy orders were grossly deceived. To put it another way, his past might well have proven to be an insurmountable impediment to ordination which raises the question: Did his ordaining bishop know about his past and elect to ordain him anyway?"

President Barack Obama is a gentleman in the truest sense of the word.  Gracious and intelligent in a country where the uncompromising, spiteful, neo-con right wing, have tried to curtain his every positive move.  Against all odds he has prevailed.

"BOSTON — The Associated Press reports that hundreds of students walked out of their classes on Oct. 18 in protest of recent incidents of racism at Boston College.

Despite what it may look like at Boston College, “The Lord remembers his covenant for ever” (Psalm 105:8a).  “`I tell you, everyone who acknowledges me (as did the walkouts at Boston College) before others the Son of Man will acknowledge before the angels of God” (Luke 12:8).

"Your argument that the military should wait until a group of people are widely accepted before ""allowing"" them to serve is...well...bad and not particularly grounded in reality.

Military integration for African-Americans happened in 1948 (read:before the civil rights act). Women had been fighting in America's wars since the beginning, but were ultimately integrated into combat roles out of necessity during the World Wars and in fact, were treated equally until the 1994 combat exclusionary policy was enacted, which by the way, I can't find any justification for. But think about that, women were serving combat roles until they were just arbitrarily banned in 1994 and that didn't get lifted until 2015. Just before that, 40,000 women served in the Gulf War, which included engaging with the enemy. And to reiterate, were just arbitrarily banned afterwards. Did the acceptance of women decline after they fought and bled for their country?"
I always find it so interesting to see how the print media is always trying to manipulate us.

This is to except in photographs in the print media.  This one here is a pleasant blue; I've photographs of pink ones and even one that had a multi-coloured pattern.   These colours would never be allowed with the modestly dressed muslim.    So people just be aware you are being manipulated!!!!!

One of them was in the journal of the John Birch Society(!).

Frederick Douglass would have had ample reason to make fallacious claims about black Confederates: his thinking--I've read a lot by and about him--was that combat service by African American troops in the Union Army would substantiate black folks' claims to full citizenship. 

So he may have been lying simply to make Lincoln think that there was a need for the Union to mobilize black troops. Same about the newspaper article (singular) saying two companies of black Confederates marched through Augusta; in war the first casualty is truth, as someone said.

No real historian would make such an outlandish claim based on such problematic evidence. And none has."

Perhaps you aren't aware of the role that public protest demonstrations played in advancing civil rights for black people in the US, in ending the US involvement in the Vietnam War, that helped bring women the right to vote, that pushed the awarding to gays of equal civil rights with heterosexuals, and brought justice and resolution to many other issues.

"Ordinary Chinese do care about free speech, but there is a lot at stake. In the past there have been political cleansing campaigns where police drag you away and put you in hidden jails, called ""black jails"", where no one, including your family and friends, knows you are there. There is a lot more at stake when unknown police can detain you this way. Would you take the chance?

So you post your opinion, get on the radar of the CCP. The next time you might be detained instead of having your writing deleted. After this you might disappear for a couple of weeks or years, tried in a secret court, found guilty and sent away to some cold place for hard labour. Would you so easily speak up?

There is the North American way to voice dissent and there are other ways in other countries. I try not to judge too harshly until I walk in the cotton shoes of the Chinese. I did, and did not like what I saw."

Thank you coach Courtney. Reading the story gave me the chills. I have always wanted to ask a hater why they hated my black self. The answer the hater gave was understandable to me. Maybe now the hater can see himself in a person that looks like me. Thank you Mr Furniss for opening your heart. Even if only for a moment.Peace man.
"Charles a few fact checks, Hickel was voted in with the black line ballot, put in place by Bill Egan.
Wally was picked by a central committee and had to meet the three year Republican party member requirement.
 This black line ballot (Egan's), had the stipulation that your vote was discarded if you crossed the black line running down center of ballot.
 Republicans on one side of ballot, Democrats on other.
Wally immediately removed that ballot, to align with the 47 ballot initiative, which wanted all candidates on same ballot."
"This is a sentiment I hear frequently from folks (mostly seminarians and priests) who have a fondness for the Extraordinary Form.  Then again, I see those same folks adding features of the Extraordinary Form to the Ordinary Form Mass, even though, at least in my reading, the indult Quattuor Abhinc Annos (cf. condition ""d.""), would seem to prohibit it.

"All errors are not on one side.    Outright resentment of higher levels of education is not unusual in any society.

An educated black man could only be protrayed with a bone in his nose by at least some of those who's 'real' lives include high levels of bigotry.  (please note, I'm not saying race was a factor for all Obama haters, maybe they just didn't like him being so smart and uppity.)

We would not have a United States of America without the leadership of elite men, (wealthy and educated), men who understood the challenges, the gifts, the weaknesses of those wtih elite power worldwide.  Jefferson would be the poster boy for the 'elite' although he was hardly alone as a cornerstone of the developing political movement in the American colonies.

"@Alceste -- feel free to research this point on your own.  The CBC/The National coverage of the swearing-in ceremony captures this (at 2:29 in the video if you want to fast-forward) and there are multiple other screen captures from different media at the time.

"I read McElroy's remarks and saw the playback (where there was audio).  It is wrong to characterize this as an anti-Trump event as it would have happened anyway.  Sadly, there was no audience participation, which may have broadened the opinions expressed.  There is a place for liberty in Catholic thought - without human freedom we are moral automatons.  That is not virtue, it is moral tyranny.

Carson does not have the self-respect to realize that he is getting the ""black seat"" at the cabinet table.  That lack of self-awareness disqualifies them (as well as the lack of experience in housing).  He should be at HHS, not HUD, except that he is fringe either way.

"Depending upon what era film-makers need, not far from Vancouver there is...Victoria.

""Old Town"" Victoria, has streets full of one, two and three-storey brick buildings, circa 1870s-1890s, complete with cast-iron Bay windows (shipped direct from 'frisco.)  These streets were used for a little-known 1982 Canadian western (what other kind is there?) originally titled, Harry Tracy, Desperado (new title: ""Last of the Wild Bunch"")  Bruce Dern as Tracy, and, as one of the lawmen on the hunt for him--Gordon Lightfoot.  (True!)

Some scenes were shot in Cariboo Goldrush town of Barkerville, near Quesnel, BC.  Victoria (with earth-covered asphalt) stood in for 1900 Portland, Oregon.  Some of the chase scenes, through hip-deep water, in and out of overgrowth, were shot on Victoria's Gorge waterway, near Esquimalt's Banfield Park.

There's an entire downtown, virtually untouched since it was rebuilt after a catastrophic 1900s fire) in the Kootenays, near the BC/Alberta border, at ...Fernie BC..."

"I don't think anyone who understand what the actual message is (a protest of police killing of unarmed black people, mostly men and boys) has lost the message. Those who think the black players kneeling shows disrespect to our flag or to our military, also haven't lost the message, they never had it right in the first place.

The players hurt no one with their protest. When the anthem is over, they go out and play the same as always. Trump is making a big deal of this in order to distract attention from how he is screwing up absolutely everything he can lay his hands on. We're lucky to have this little controversy; otherwise, like the last Republican president, Trump might need a very expensive war to take everyone's minds off his screwups."

"A year and so ago, Naila Keleta-Mae was praising the art of the spectacle.

https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/black-lives-matter-is-dramatic-unsettling-and-inconvenient-thats-the-point/article30758467/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&

Politics as spectacle is destructive. It inflames emotion rather than stimulates reason.  One time moments of superficial drama as opposed to the construction of a long term process of engagement and dialogue.

So while I agree Trump is the sad stuff of spectacle, I suggest Naila Keleta-Mae reflect on the spectacle of those she praised. When one promotes the environment of spectacle, don't be surprised when that becomes the operating motif for all. You too become just another symptom of a deeper disease in civil society."
"Whirligig,
No apology was asked for. It was already given along with monetary compensation and the man whose case had gone all the way to the Supreme Court was presented with a Freedom medal by the President of the United States years later.
This to me is fascinating history! 
The point is that we can learn from mistakes made in the past. Reading through documents written by officials at the time I read some illuminating information about the mind sets at the time.
One of the questions was why they were singled out and why Germans and Italians were not rounded up and sent to camps too.  Questions about violating their civil rights as most of them had lbeen born here. 
Recognizing the contributions made by people who served or aided our troops at a time when they were treated very unfairly is important because it reminds us to to not repeat it and it's never too late to say Thank you !  The Hmong, Black Americans and Japanese-Americans all made significant contributions to our country."
"President Trump has been proven truthful again!! As the smoke has cleared in Charlottesville there were no less than three groups who were at fault. On Friday the Klan, with a permit, was the only group there marching peacefully. The first 24 hours were so peaceful that the police in the town issued a stand down order. The next day the busses arrived with the Antifar group and Black Lives Matters who then taunted the supremacist group. This is were the riots began so Trump was correct in stating that all sides were at fault...
 
The Democrats have seized on the monument issue to cover the fact that Russian narrative has fallen flat and Mueller is about to be out of a job. If the Democrats want to remove a statue why don't they make a move to get rid of General Albert Pike in Washington. The Left and the Democrats will not touch this statue!  

 It is sad that in all areas of protest led by the Democrats someone is hurt and someone's property is destroyed. This is what they do."
"The American version is self-interest rationalized by Biblical interpretation.

"You'll notice there is no ideological agenda to pursue on the back of tragedy, so the deaths of these people are of no concern.  And hence the usual suspects aren't commenting.

"See comments below re: Jorge Borjas and Adam Davidson.

The Chamber of Commerce, mainly Republican, is a main player in corporate cronyism.  

Opposed to corporate cronyism --- and to illegal immigration --- is Cornell University labor economist Vernon Briggs, Jr., who, in his briefing to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights regarding ""The Impact of Illegal Immigration on the Wages and Employment Opportunities of Black Workers,"" stated that ""no issue has negatively-affected the economic well-being of African Americans more‖ than immigration. * * *  Dr. Briggs viewed such losses as a denial of basic civil rights and economic opportunity.""

"One and a half stars?

Really, Professor Semley?

I see that over on the huge, accumulated averages of reviews over at the Tomato website, this movie has about a 90 percent favorable rating, in the same league for very high ratings as ""Wonder Woman"" and ""Dunkirk""...

... and is totally smashing, in scores, the low-star rated films such as Valerian, Kidnap, and The Dark Tower, which got scores in low ranges there that one would EXPECT ""Detroit"" to be rated if reviewers out there had tastes or outlooks such as yours.

Sorry, good professor, but your rating for this movie is WILDLY out of synch with the vast pool of reviews out there. Surely you will forgive readers for wondering why this might be? Might it have something to do with the fact that the political hyperventilation there at the University of Toronto, in areas such as Black Lives Matter and political correctness and a complete and total detachment from American urban realities, is skewing your worldview out of tilt with others?"
"Symbol of hate, targeted at African Americans, the manager really is not addressing this problem that creates fear.

Pfleger's parishioners are not necessarily Catholic or even church-going Protestants.  They are manly Blacks, but also members of  other minorities in a poverty-infested, drug-infested, gang-infested area.  Speaking like the 'law and order' High Priests of Israel at Christ's Trial---won't do anything to turn anybody around.  As far as your ""dogeared Alinsksy playbook"" goes---those ideas are as dated as last week's bread.  It's easy to condemn a Cardinal who won't sit in his chancery like a Baron [too many of our bishops do], but who is  trying to get people together to talk, to plan something that might work FOR THEM.   Are you re-resurrecting yourself with a new alias?"
"""Companies in the highest quartile of racial or ethnic diversity are 35 per cent more likely to outperform those in the bottom quartile"" Anybody know where she got this? I don't believe her unless ""outperform"" is measured by self-reports rather than the bottom line.      
Ironic how she prefers a product made in relatively homogenous environment: ""I like German engineering"". German and Japanese companies are far less racially diverse and have stronger emphasis on ""fitting in"" yet are more efficient, competitive, and cohesive than more diverse organizations elsewhere.
I wonder how well she would fit in at a law-firm of mostly blacks or south-asians, epecially when it came time to leave work early for ulitimate frisbee.
 The author argues for more objective selection procedures based on merit, which I agree with, but she contradicts herself when she then praises BMO's affirmative action hiring, which is ultimately a form of discrimination that leads to unjust outcomes for everyone."

She is very cunning uses this women thing so it seems she is fighting for something to draw attention and backup but it has nothing to do with it!!

"Yes, this was a game I won't be replaying with my DVR even as the Blazers win a playoff series.  There was no building to a crescendo, nothing even close; but more like the ending of the French Connection and a fade to black.  Gritty and Grimy but nowhere as memorable as the French Connection."
"""we should not waste a good crisis""  Abedian & Mantell have certainly not wasted the crisis, using it to write trite inanities.

KPMG were, as the authors say, merely the hitmen.  What about the Zumafia paymasters instructing them?   KPMG wrote k@k but didn't force SARS, Mashiane Moodley & Monama or Adv Sikhakhane to lie.  Their report was trashed in J van Loggerenberg's book; SARS & the media didn't need the GuptaEmails. And the v Loggerenberg/Walters/Tobacco/SARS thang remains murky.

Why, too, was ANC SCOPA whip, Nyami Booi at a SARS press conference?

The new President Protector unlawfully and incompetently assaulted the Constitution and banks for doing what the New Vigilantes want KPMG to have done: refuse to condone Zupta illegalities.  But the rageratti are silent on this, leaving it to the DA.

Why should KPMG's audits go to (um) ""empowerment firms"" unless they offer best value (KPMG had a black boss, so what?).   The basis of Corruptheid is to undermine appointment on merit."
"I respect what you said ANTHEIA, we are all different, and the beauty is we are all Americans, and we have many things that also brings us unity, one was the flag. I have 3 Hispanic sons, they are Americans first, even when someone treats them with disrespect, whether it be racially or otherwise. They faced it before, I certainly did in prison where this issue is magnified many times. 

When I was young, I remember the race riots, the assassinations, the war protests and it was probably the closest this nation every came to breaking.

The PD's in the US need to get rid of the racist cops - at any given time it's determined they have shown they are racist - while on the job or otherwise.

"Greetings from Dearborn MI

Past is just a prologue. Seeds of American Civil War were laid during the Revolution itself. Civil War was the worst of times. Tenth of military age died during it, never since.

Civil Wars renew social contracts. American Founding Fathers were agrarian slave owners. Within 4 generations their Constitution was already out of date as the rapidly industrializing North needed cheap labour free from land. The Civil War was between Washington and Lincoln that the latter won.

As China leads Globalization and Free Trade integrating the world breaking borders, America is still mired in land based Agrarian Slave Owning age Constitution modified by 26 Amendments. But there comes a time when dress is so worn out than no amount of stitches suffice.

America needs a new Social Contract aligned with the emerging world order. China and Mexico hating Trump is the New South. But my last 20 years on East and West fail to locate where is the New North with the New Lincoln?"

"While gerrymandering is an ancient practice, it has been turned into an artform in recent times. the gerrymander in Wisconsin is so great that even in 2012,  a year where Obama won the state by 7 points, Republicans still won 60 seats. It favors Republicans by 14 points, which is a margin so large even a huge national Democratic wave wouldn't overcome it. Wisconsin isn't the only state to be greatly gerrymandered, Michigan, Ohio and North Carolina are as well. In the South, party is historically tied to race, blacks almost always vote Democrat, thus any change to limit African American political power, by extension is also a change to limit Democratic political power.  The Voting rights Act requiring pre-clearance was a good idea, but it did not go far enough. it needed to address all states with a history of  denying minorities the right to vote. Wisconsin would have not qualified under the original rules, but its actions since 2010 mean it would qualify now. Gerrymanders need to go."
"""Caught between the fearful underground economy of yesterday and the optimistic, free-market opportunity of tomorrow..."" Wow, Mintz, keep repeating those media scare tropes and you'll continue to alienate your readers. Generating a moral panic over black market MJ is reprehensible, but so is reinforcing one.

Peer-reviewed research has shown that black market MJ does not, in fact, involve organized crime (see Boyd & Carter, 2014; McCann 2014). Boyd and Carter went so far as to examine years of Crown Porsecutor files and RCMP case history files only to find that 5% of said cases revealed links to organized crime, and 6% were associated with firearms---barely higher than the national average of licensed firearm owners. 

But research HAS revealed that the ""free-market opportunity of tomorrow"" (Licensed Producers), is poisoning Canadian consumers of medical marijuana.

"We do have converts who are married men & are priests because they, in theory, were not able to discern their vocation properly outside our church.   

I disagree with this argument because if God wanted these men to be Catholic Priests, God is more than capable of making certain they don't find Mrs. Right before coming to Catholicism.  

However, as long as women are being ordained equally to men in our church FIRST, I have no problem with our church doing away with celibacy, later on or simultaneously.  

The difference is a human justice issue compared to a mere custom issue.  Denying someone a sacrament based on how they are born is discrimination against someone's flesh without cause in Christ to do so, which diminishes that person's value from birth.  So keeping blacks, women, Spanish, etc. from priesthood is sin.  The married men in our church chose to marry & not become celibate priests.  They were not discriminated against from birth.  There is no injustice done to these men."
"Where do you get that from the article?  There is no where that I see that Michelle Obama said that it was a horrible 8 years.  She did say that comments about her that ridiculed her based on the color of her skin or her body shape hurt her.  Tell you what, you post a picture of your wife, girlfriend, mom or sister; I will ridicule a physical characteristic that she has and then get a couple of hundred people (not 10s of millions like Michelle Obama) to discuss it ad nauseam on just the internet (not every major news outlet in the country like Michelle Obama's situation) and then you can tell me how she feels about it."

"What I've found with most of the partisan sites, including the one you posted, is that they generally let you know only part of the truth, the parts that support their bias.  What they say may be factually correct, but hardly ever the full story.  Ex.  How many blacks were lifted the middle class through affirmative action, including men like Colin Powel.  How many children didn't starve because of poverty programs.   I'm not ignoring the dismal failure of leadership in some cities, but it's not the whole story.  

What partisan writing leaves out is more telling, than what they put in the article.     

*Being an ex Democrat, I can tell you that I become an independent after I started looking at the Democratic party with the same critical eye I used for Republicans.  There's a list of party policy that disappoints.   

In fairness, Republicans are even weaker in most of the areas's that are important to me.   That doesn't let Democrats off the hook.  

It's bad policy vs no policy."
"‘Yes, they screwed up when they compromised on Reconstruction, over the vote on a presidential election, eased off and let the southern apologists institute Jim Crow.’ There was indeed Jim Crow and then came the Civil Rights Act in 1964. The civil rights movement triggered massive rioting by the blacks, followed by urban blight and rampant drug use all across the US during the 60s and 70s. Guess that was a lot better than Jim Crow."
"""Beyond this, though, what the massive turnout on Saturday suggests is a degree of hopelessness among South Africans.

This is a cutting statement and a great insight. Except I do think it implies the other side of the coin that's a problem: that politics is supposed to save us. It can't. It never has. It will continue to disappoint. 

Politics has its place but it's not everything. I wonder if in a post-liberation context like ours if we haven't placed too much stock in it; too much stock in the political process. Which is why people make our nation-building to be either up to God alone or the government alone, but by-and-large don't want to make themselves uncomfortable to get it done. Meanwhile, Jesus says YOU (and *I*) must love our neighbour. He does already."

"Trudeau and the Liberals for as an yet unknown reason desperately want a seat on the U.N.'s Security Council. To that end they have done everything possible to gain the attention of the U.N. with suitable gestures and of course large sums of money to be spread around on various U.N. sanctioned causes.  The mission to Mali or some other African country is one of those gestures. There is a very real likelihood that some of our troops will either be injured or die, as this will be peacekeeping. When the unfortunate does happen, I hope that enough people will remind Trudeau of the price that was paid in order to get  the dubious seat on a U.N. Council."

I couldn't agree more. Our nation has never been perfect. If we are to continue our uneven progress towards our ideals, we simply must protest our failings, as we have done for generations - Civil War, unionization/worker rights, women's suffrage, civil rights, Stonewall/gay rights, free speech movement, anti-war movements, environmental movements and, lately, black lives matter. Sadly, most of these movements and protests are repeats of attempts to rectify our American Original Sin of slavery and racism. We're slowly, unevenly moving forward, but only because of people like these fine SEHS students. 

Bravo, and excellent response from the principal."
"""Your country? How came it yours? Before the Pilgrims landed we were here. Here we have brought our...gifts and mingled them with yours: a gift of story and song--soft, stirring melody in an ill-harmonized and unmelodious land; the gift of sweat and brawn to beat back the wilderness, conquer the soil, and lay the foundations of this vast economic empire two hundred years earlier than your weak hands could have done it...""

"Again, just to remain factual, the woman in this case is not African American--although race is not really material to this situation anyway."
"The LGBT ""community"" should get together with African Americans - you just can't win with either. The writer of this piece should take into account that the folks posting on Twitter are not exactly a representative cross section of gays - and a ""reporter"" for the Daily Beast has all the journalistic integrity and weight of the neighborhood gossip. 

Kudos to Spacey for owning up to his past behavior."
"So, it's quite obvious that we should treat people according to their skin colour, in the absence of DNA testing which can confirm ones victimhood status. The other lesson for the children is to be very careful when you interact with black people lest you accidentally offend. It might be safest to just stay away."
"It is black people that experience this kind of structural violence on a daily basis because of the many failures of our government.

Then change your government.."
"“Black” market means what exactly?

Clandestine? Illegal? 

So then “black” people? What does that mean?

So that’s my point."
"Clearly you don't understand the use of examples .   The American flag is supposed to be something we can all take pride in and despite our differences on issues--the flag brought us all together .  Football games were meant to let us escape our daily lives for a few hours and enjoy time together---again--despite the differences we may share.  Then these over priced punks decided they wanted to invade our time with this miss-guided nonsense .  Kappernick clearly got what he deserves--as will the NFL if they don't stop using games to push they're issues.  Will you support my right to use the N word to the same level you support these players rights to disrespect America ?   As for All in the Family , I never liked that show .  Look how far we have come since then--electing a black president .  Now rich blacks want to move us backwards. What a shame ."
"Except Bill Clinton and the black guy................. 
.............. who individually left office with approvals higher than Bush and Trump combined"
"""It is hard to see the Trump Presidency as anything other than a direct repudiation of the racial rapprochement, and comity, that the previous election of Barack Obama once promised.

I fail to see anything but complete failure on Obama's part to fulfill the promise referred to. What I saw was the rise of BLM and a spike in the temperature of the racial conversation. I believe the black community at large and its well respected leaders across America also failed, miserably, by not standing up and demanding more from Obama.

America voted for change. Real change. Not a repeat of failure by Hillary and Bill and Barack. And if the black community wants to share in that change they should be working with Trump vs. the ridiculous references to the KKK which hold as much water as a resurgence of the Black Panthers or the SLA.

Lastly, I worry about the state of education is this is the level of insight and knowledge being delivered."
"Yeah, that's it. 

That's why they handcuffed him and left him in the middle of the road because, ""they were concerned for his safety"". 

Just admit it, this is just another story of a trigger happy cop, who is probably more then a little racist, shooting an unarmed black man."
Prog:   I don't hear protests about black on black violence.   But that's none of my business (takes sip of Chardonnay).

Our apathy about you has nothing to do with your race (assuming you are actually black). There are many other reasons to not care about you.
"You do understand that ""protesting"" as you put it, is protected speech under the Constitution, right?  If you don't like black folks, or them speaking out makes you uncomfortable, or whatever, that is your baggage, not a legal or criminal issue."
"EE: Indeed, ""racism"" is not a crime...it is not illegal.  When it becomes manifested in actions which discriminate  or cause others to fear for their personal safety, it may, indeed, ""become"" a crime.  

We saw millions of racists come ""out from the shadows"" when President Obama was elected.  Suddenly, it because ""fashionable"" to post racist comments on the internet...entire websites were created just for such posts....Indeed, it is protected ""free speech.""  Disgusting, deplorable, dispicable perhaps, but certainly protected free speech.  Sure, it's legal for folks to wear 'blackface"" and mock AfricanAmericans.  Sure, it's legal for kids to tell Latino kids ""hey, get ready to be deported""...""hey, pack your bag.""  Indeed, with the election of Donald Trump and with the racist and xenophobic comments he made during his campaign, we will now see increased ""license"" to emulate those comments.  Racism is ""alive and well"" in America today.  I find that very, very sad......Gary Crum"
"The Progressive Marxists HATE America.

Thats why there are so many participants at black lives matter riots during the middle of the work day.
"People once chose to believe ""black"" humans were property. They minimized it in their minds to conceal and deal with the legal crime of their time."
and where did the father go? I'm willing to bet he flew the koop like many black men in his situation
"Such as murdering and maiming people by running your car into the crowd, or promoting hatred against Jews, or just being part of a terrorist organization like the KKK with a long history of murdering Black People? You're talking nonsense. Fighting back against right-wing hate is not Left-wing hate and intolerance, it's standing up for what's right."
"Maybe they're busy holding marches for all the murdered black people in Chicago.

Oh wait, they don't care about them."
"That doesn't address the question of why so many black, completely unarmed suspects, suspects running away, and so on, are shot, except in terms of a lack of training and professionalism by the police. Police, who are supposed to be equipped to deal with dangerous situations, confess to being scared to death. They are especially scared of black people, which could perhaps be excused on the part of an untrained lay person. Do you think military police and members of the clandestine services respond to danger by emptying their weapons into the subject? I don't think 5% is a very impressive number. But it's about the money. Police mostly handle routine social scut work and most are not really emotionally and physically trained to the level necessary to deal with dangerous situations, and policing is not even in the top ten of dangerous occupations. The public simply doesn't want to assume the cost of training police to the level it would take. And, no, I'm not going to swap studies."
"Yes, and if you're black and walk into a restaurant and they say ""we don't want to serve you, get out,"" you should just leave and find a place that will serve you. Simple, just like the south in the 1950s."
"Thanks. I will watch it. Doe's that prove the ""state sponsored violence""? In summary, how did FW do it? Did he pay black people to kill their brothers?"
"Actually, Joe, what they stated was not racist.

What you stated was.

They were making a comparison, whereas you were fully buying into the racist agenda of the Black Lives Matter rhetoric, which is racist.

Black lives do indeed matter, just as any individual of any other ""group"" matters.

How about this, Joe?

ALL individual lives matter, no matter their demographic, as those of your own ilk, define them?

I am sick of racists and bigots such as our own Government, sick of racists such as the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement, and sick of racists and bigots such as yourself.

Why?

Because all they, and you, concentrate upon is the demographic that an individual belongs unto, within theirs, and your own view, rather than simply the individual, AS an individual, themselves

They, and you, Joe, disregard and disrespect the individual, because of your own racist, bigoted, and misogynist ideology.

But you just keep on keeping on.

But you cannot justify it.

Ever. ."
"Awww, I thought we were having a conversation about race, I didn't know saying black was now taboo.  It gets a little warm and you get uncomfortable?  Grow up and have the conversation instead of hiding behind racism to mask your hypocrisy.  You made a statement about the anthem, expect a reply or don't post."
"But, boy, those black guys, can they ever run and play basketball..."
"Because immigration laws are rules of exclusion, and progressives go crazy when you mention any exclusion (except ""black safe zones"" or black-only student centers) or any rule that runs in favor of traditional America.  They would even tolerate Sharia law here, because it goes against the American grain.  Anything that goes against the American grain, they like."
"The fact that he and BHO have personal/professional ties, and also that they may have met prior to Watson rendering his terribly prejudiced decision should make him ""faulty"" and his decision should be nullified.  This is similar to what former POTUS Clinton did talking to AG prior to HRDs email scandal.  Watson is a damn fool if he had discussed this matter with his buddy BHO (black panther, extremist muslim operative).  So sorry folks the show should end here.  CONSPIRACY written all over his decision!!!"
"GBA:  If Charles is about our age (70-75) and lived his life as a black man in America, he has experienced a very, very different America than did you and I.  Would it do you any harm to acknowledge that.  He, I'm sure, could tell you anecdotes of institutional discrimination and personal discrimination and racial insults he experienced over his life.  Would it do you any harm to muster just a little empathy for him.  From all I gather, he's a very bright, competent man who succeeded in life through a) his talents, b) his perserverence and c) his ability to, somehow, tolerate the mistreatment he received and ""bounce back"".  Today, I think his attitude reflects all those experiences he's had...just as our lives reflect our experiences.  Does he sound angry? Yes, indeed, he does.  I don't know about you, but, I'm guessing if I had received the treatment Mr. Dalton has received because he's Black over his lifetime, I'd be on very angry man myself.  BTW: why are you so nasty and angry?"

"Germany does NOT have statues celebrating the Nazi Party, the genocide of Jews and other racial, ethnic and cultural groups and promoting the maintenance and revival of racism.  You can acknowledge and study the dark chapters of your history without celebrating them.....there is a very important difference.  I fully understand that the Civil War is part of our history.  I fully understand that slavery is part of our history.  I fully understand that racism is part of our history......and, unfortunately still part of our ""present.""  Some of the statues in question were erected to celebrate racism and the Jim Crow era and created in the early 20th century; others were erected in opposition to the Civil Rights Movement......in both eras, they were clear manifestations of racism designed to intimidate Black Americans.  Those wish to retain them overwhelmingly support that same racism.  Gary Crum"
Trump is back in Houston. Another do-over to masquerade as a descent human being. I saw him lift and 'air kiss' a small black child. He can't even fake empathy.
"I think most Republicans still support Trump, but it must not be a very happy experience for them. The Republican party is in a way a fake party, cobbled together mostly by a common hatred of a black president but otherwise not able to work together. Their steadfast inability and unwillingness to appeal to Latino voters will cause more and more problems for them going forward."
"I understand the DM narrative is that all farmers is racist - even a small dairy farmer in the Swiss Alps. But please
"" it has been unable to protect them from neighbourhood racists."" Without balanced reporting this may just be someone enforcing a legal right to water, water reticulation or land legally purchased.
Example.
We bought a water right from our local scheme for a few R100,000. But we do allow some of the community to collect water and wash laundry in the canal. These people live on a plot owned by a black man - and he does not provide any water for all the tenants, but collects the rent. Yes the fountain belongs to the people (viva communism), but only some of the people maintains the infrastructure to get the water 3km closer. We can charge them money, because we are racist farmers you know. But we do not."
"I was comparing the African culture of the 18th century with  that of American culture of the same time period.   No, I do not assume all black people are genetically pre-disposed to tribal violence.   It is however what has been going on in much of Africa for eons.    There are some areas in Africa that have gotten away from it, but it is still common."
"You remind me of a guy who used to call himself ""Proud Surrey"" at the National Post.  (He was also known as ""Proudly Surly"".)  Your claim misses out on right-wing violence in Europe, burnings of black churches, economic violence (which I imagine you don't believe in) as perpetuated by the Chicago School, the occasional murder of a doctor who provides abortions, and the fact that in North America, there is little for the right to protest; they are largely running the show.
The car-burning crowd generally consists of the Black Bloc thugs, who are anarchists, not leftists.  The overwhelming majority of people involved in recent protests have behaved well.  I know -- I've been in some."
But they should if they are going to imprison black men. It's their RIGHT! How dare they even incarcerate a black man!
"Black person: Sesssion's bankrupted the KKK in his prosecution of them in Alabama

   i don't enjoy responding to your posts, i feel like i'm taking advantage of a child in many ways.   
  i've come to realize you really have no idea how to actually communicate with others -  your go- to response is always something nasty .. often unrelated to anything. what you think are slickly ""hidden and coded ""  in your posts are well known, degrading  terms regarding blacks, women, gays ""druggies"", etc . terms an insecure person would use to feel better about themselves. the fact that you throw them in totally unrelated places is just desperate.  i do feel bad for you"
"One of the many reasons that people have protested Mr. Trump is the terrible choices in his cabinet.  For instance, in an example of ignorance so remarkable that it seems impossible, Ms. DeVos remarked that historically black colleges were established for school choice, and not because institutional racism prevented black students from attending other colleges.  The prideful and willful ignorance of Ms. DeVos - obvious during her incredible confirmation hearings - isn't recognized by Mr. Trump because he also knows nothing.

The entire administration is a hot mess."
"Because existing as a black president is ""race baiting""....

"I wish everyone who called himself a Christian would actually go back and read about the kind of person, assuming he was real, that Jesus is thought to have been.  When did He EVER discriminate against anyone?   Was his life all about fomenting hate against anyone?  I have not met many modern Christians who seem to even know who Jesus was and what Jesus was about.  And, if you read the Bible, the Torah, the Qu'ran, they all have one overriding principle in common.  They all say that God NEVER gave the right to man to judge each other.  In fact, that is a right God held back only for Himself.  And God NEVER says anywhere in any of the religious texts that there is anything wrong with homosexuality.  What there is, however, is room for people with their own prejudices and reasons for fomenting hate to interpret or misinterpret scripture toward their own hateful agenda.  They've used it to justify the subjegation of women, children, and people of color since it was written."
"Precedent Dotard's attacks on black athletes who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality and police brutality inadvertently prompted more awareness to the cause as more people began taking a knee.
Like, Meghan Linsey, a country singer who took a knee in protest at the Titans-Seahawks game earlier this week after performing the Star-Spangled Banner.
It was a bold move for a country singer to show solidarity with African-Americans who have endured injustices.
Since she took a knee, death threats poured in but she says she has no regrets, even though she received hate mail from ‘people' telling her she was anti-military and they hoped she would get cancer.
Yep.

Supremacist terrorists are all they are."

"Funny how multi millionaire sportsmen are on this bandwagon, while literally thousands of Black Americans are being gunned down by other Black Americans compared to a few shot by police - the supposed root of this protest. Seems like not all life is sacred. It just depends on who shoots you. Beats me."
"This issue is ultimately about legally creating a third gender or class of human beings. Males, Females and Transgender-gay. Federal signs concretizing this law for bathrooms have already been created. The man, the woman (skirt) and the transgender half-skirt. This illusion has been achieved by making gender synonymous with race. Gay equals black-brown or the minority of your choice-they are the same legal identity-victims of oppression. Gays/transgender are now allegedly a race of people. Therefore as a legal recognized race of people they are liberally entitled to special privileges and Laws protecting them-special financing-affirmative action-job preference and so on. I personally do not believe sex or sexual identity should be elevated to the level of race. I have no issues with anyone's sexual proclivities, identities or desires. The same laws protect all of us. I prefer that we are all Americans and not hyphenated-Americans. 
There is nothing exceptional about sexual identity."
"Do you live in a cave?  If you don't understand the legacy of slavery and the continued disadvantage of black and brown minorities, then​ nothing I can add will be of value."
"Of course it was about protecting the institution of slavery!  ""States' rights"" concerned the right to keep humans in perpetual bondage, to buy and sell them, to torture and rape them.

Not framed in those terms.  Southern politicians claimed that holding blacks as slaves created conditions for all members of their society, including the slaves, superior to the inequities and strife of northern and European society.  But the large body of slave narratives shows this lie for what it was.  See, for instance, Frederick Douglass' autobiography, or Solomon Northrup's TWELVE YEARS A SLAVE, lately adapted into a movie.

If you doubt southern motives as they existed before the Civil War, please have a look at speeches by leaders of  the southern states before their secession.  You can find some of those speeches at http://www.confederatepastpresent.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&layout=blog&id=41&Itemid=54&limitstart=10 .  ""States' rights"" is post-war whitewashing."
"Like all pro illegal immigrant orgs, the bishops refuse to say just how many illegal immigrants America should take in every year.

And the bishops also fail to mention that it used to be African Americans who held the jobs that illegal immigrants have taken.    This loss of employment has had a huge effect on Black culture in the U.S., and for the worse.    Nope, no mention of that in their bromides about the value of family.

What a coincidence that the majority of illegals are Catholic or come from a Catholic culture.   Not a coincidence really.   The bishops are just putting parochial issues over that of America's best interests, and quoting the bible to try to give it moral weight."
"Yup, cause black men never deal with stereo types about having too many children."
"I am 65 years old and of mixed racial heritage. Even on the reservation we called criminals thugs. No blacks lived on the reservation back then. 
I now live in Alaska for 44 years, we call bums who steal, beat up people, and make threats to little old ladies THUGS. THUGS come in all colors, shapes, and sizes. 
Thugs are bullies, they are usually not very smart and depend on their muscles not brains to get them through life. 
Ruffians, hooligans, and vandals were names that my grandparents called the neighborhood THUGS.  Villains and gangsters were 70's words for THUGS.
These days people throw around ""RACIST"" so much that they take away from what a real racist is. A THUG can be a racist and a RACIST can be a THUG. 
Look at it this way, in the US we call a bathroom by many terms, latrines, toilet, head, powder room, bathroom, restroom, crapper, out-house. In England and other former British colonies, they call them water closets, loos, John's, lavatory, the Ladies and the Gentleman's."
"IRT Karen Howell, have the people who kneel in protest to our National Anthem given some thought to the fact that although most African- American football players are descendants of slaves, they are much better off socially, economical and professionally in the United Sates than people of African origin living in Africa or anywhere else in the world?  If they know of such place, I urge them to move there immediately, if not sooner."

"You are a slow learner. How many times do I need to tell you that millions of adults are dependents for tax purposes? Clearly, you think only those who are not tax dependents should have the right to vote. Which political party did you say you were from? Who else should not have the right to vote? Clearly, ""convicted felons"" (scary language alert) should not be allowed to vote. How about those on welfare? They don't even pay taxes! Strip them of their right to vote. How about renters. They don't own land, so they shouldn't be allowed to vote. Clearly, negroes should not be allowed to vote, right?"
"214.

What about the shooting of black men in the United States? You tell us about Chinese  and Cuban human rights. Better still tell that to Trump and his friends at the NRA."
"Like Mike Brown? The maority of police shootings have been justified. Not all, but so many that calling them all murders and pointing the wrong fingers does nothing to realize the situation 

The problem isn't why so many young blacks are getting shot by police, but why are so many young blacks engaging in crime.  And in the clear case of Michael Brown, violently resisting arrest?  Michael Brown tried to kill a cop and has been martyred by the black community. This in itself is divisive."
If you gave a speech and nobody listened did you really say anything?  If people march down the street and you turn your back on them did they show you anything?  I can think of so many ways to confront these pot bellied bozos that does not involve violence.  Time to channel Mahatma Gandhi and not the lunatics like Black Lives Matter or Antifa!
"What exactly are you appalled about? Afghanistan's Taliban government  provided material support for Al Qaeda to invade the US and to kill thousands of people in New York. The Taliban was breaching every human rights law on the planet at the time (you may recall the Taliban blowing up ancient Buddhist statues and stoning women to death in football stadiums). What exactly is it about Afghanistan in 2001 that inspired your better democratic modern sensibilities? Or are you a fan or proponent of austere medieval religious death cults ruling countries. 

Afghanistan deserved to be invaded. Iraq did not. This was Bush's mistake. And Canada, as a signatory to Article 5 of NATO, had to join the US invasion of Afghanistan. It is a requirement under the mutual defence provisions of NATO's Charter. The problem with Afghanistan is that it is hopelessly mired in the ancient superstition of Islam. It will take hundreds of years to shed this black death cult."
"You must live in a very sheltered world, indeed, Sr. Maureen, if you do not know any Trump voters.  Most of us meet them at the Post Office, at work, in the grocery store.
One thing that they all have in common is that they do not believe that homophobia or racism, or assault of women are unacceptable.  If they did, they would not have voted for the man.    
I tried to speak with some Trump voters before the election, but was told that Hillary is a liar, baby-killer, national security threat, etc.  They insisted that their statements were fact, not opinion, and there was no way to reason.
Talking with racists about racism is usually difficult, because many make racist statements and then insist that what they said was not racist.  
I do agree that if the Republican candidates were to stop scapegoating immigrants and non-whites for the plight of the middle class, we would all be better off."
"The irony is that Kim Jong Orange and his merry band of soulless GOP buddies are trying to kick their own supporters square in the jimmy.

But you won't change your behavior so you blame racism for the differences between your relations with police and the rest of society. Even though this is abhorrent to you it would be worth a  try."
"That is the west society reality, people can't afford to have more kids for the prompted life style.

"Except no cops got punched, so there's that. What about the Black therapist in Miami who laid down on the street, with his hands up, telling that cop he was not armed, and STILL got shot?  Did he deserve it too?"
"Well, then, they'd better begin to wear out their shoes on some black arses."
"Still drawing his full benefits from General status as retired military despite longtime treasonous acts against the nation.  The poster child for the modern, privatized military made up of officers' free education at West Point, Naval, and Air Force academies cranking out those fundamentalist christians as one requirement for promotion along with schemes to add to income through Military Industrial Complex connections.  All paid by taxpayers.  The failures to finish transpose into Republican politics to get elected to the AK legislature to rage and rant against all of those Natives, black/brown people, and heretics not following jesus dogma.  This feudal system needs a real restructuring and house cleaning of the embedded rot since privatization."
"Black African Americans complaining is unjustified. There is no discrimination, only dealing with troublesome passengers of all denominations."
"Yeah, all the other years they weren't even close to the post season, so how would they be good examples.  Like I said, when Black makes the post season (maybe this year), I'll reconsider."
"Repeated below is a transcript of what the senator actually said (Huffington Post).
Teaching children that ""blamed black people for their health problems"" is a fair summary of this, and not an agenda-laden warped distortion, is not teaching them good citizenship.

""When you look at life expectancy, there are problems in the black race,” Marble said during a meeting of the legislature’s Economic Opportunity Poverty Reduction Task Force. “Sickle-cell anemia is something that comes up. Diabetes is something that’s prevalent in the genetic makeup, and you just can’t help it. Although I’ve got to say, I’ve never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it. Everybody loves it.”

Marble continued, “The Mexican diet in Mexico with all of the fresh vegetables, and you go down there and they are much thinner than they are up here. They’ve changed their diet. I’ve read studies on that.”"
"What?
It is the black Liberal MP Fergus who is against the decriminalization of marijuana possession, despite the fact that blacks are more likely to be charged with possession.

Fergus and his Liberal colleagues need to deal with that!"
"When I hear they are locking arms, my thoughts are:

1. They are locking their arms in unity, in defiance to the nation.
2. They don't have my values, they don't care about what I care about.
3. They are not sorry for what they've done. They regret the outcome -- a loss of future income - but they feel they are right. They are night. If Black people are oppressed in this nation, it is because they have oppressed themselves.
4. Watching again? Not anytime soon."
highly regarded by who?  The black lives matter folks I bet love him. Do not forget to tell me I am a racist as that is what most of the comments about this post will say. Time for some new material.
Black face Schill up for review?
"The Catholics used guns and acts of terrorism against their oppressors (why blow up innocent members of Lord Mountbatten's family?) However, they expect Blacks in America to turn the other cheek and be forgiving towards their oppressors here in the States. 

For some who say Blacks go back to Africa, why don't they tell the Catholics to move to the Republic, instead of trying to claim Northern Ireland all for themselves?"

"Note the updated story in ADN doesn't allow comments. The updated story in ADN even omit the facts that group of black males were even urinating in the isles as well as vandalizing the store, & state the reason for the confrontation between store employee & shooter is unknown. Enough coddling of violent criminals because they are minorities.  It's no secret anymore."
"It would be funny if it were true, but it's not.  The founders worked hard to ensure that a nobility couldn't be created here (see emoluments).  They envisioned a nation of yeoman farmers, without large disparities of wealth and incomes.

You are likely referring to the founders' definition of the body politic as excluding women, blacks, and various others.  Extending the franchise to these excluded groups is a defining feature of our national journey.  But this is a different issue."
"Well, the officer who was killed was black. Is that what you meant?"

"Yep, no one complained when a Black woman played Dorothy in the Wizard of Oz."
"Really, utilitas?  You show a Trump supporter's level of understanding or race in America.   That explains plenty.   It is so funny that you should be sticking up for immigrants since your history of posts here points to them as the cause of America's ills.

I work with both of these communities.  They came to this country under entirely different circumstances.  The African-American experience was that of over two centuries of slavery that destroyed the family and then a century of non-voting laboring poor.  The recent Asian groups you refer to weren't slaves or barred from voting when the became citizens.  There were also no laws baring them from attending school or learning to read."
Not saying that the black young adults aren't supporting black lives matter but most of this article revolves around quotes from a middle age woman. More quotes from young adults would be helpful
"It is always useful to remember that Jesus is just a mask that the Vatican wears in pursuit of secular power and influence.   This has been the case for centuries, and will continue to be the case as long as there are REAL CATHOLICS to maintain the Vatican's revenue stream.
We will know that the Vatican's revenue stream is in trouble when the first priceless painting hits the black market."
"That's utterly Orwellian. It's not ""cons"" who want to keep poor black kids in crappy schools or dependent on the welfare state, it's the Teddy Kennedys and the limousine leftists of the world. How's all that ""great society"" spending going for inner city Americans?"
"Good Grief! That's like calling Frederick Douglass a racist because he was interested only in freeing ""black"" slaves."
"The article mentions statues that were erected in 1890, so not sure why you're trying to change the narrative by suggesting otherwise?

I agree with the black mayor of Richmond's (Levar Stony's) compromise... keep the statues, but use them for education, not for glorification of a confederate past.

Unfortunately, a liberal mindset seems to think that removing statues somehow erases the sins of the past... somewhat like an ostrich sticking its head in the sand, if you ask me."
Sounds like racism and xenophobia to me. I personally am not afraid of brown and black people but I am completely nauseated by people like you.
"The comment I was responding to said, ""where they are forced to watch episodes of ""The Apprentice"" until their IQ has dropped sufficiently that they are enamored of Dear Leader.""

"Nuns used to wear a habit.  Nuns today, for the most part, do not.  The religion evolved. Can Islam not evolve as well?"
"No, it's that BLM is fixated on the police, and ignores the # of black on black murders that happen every year.

Among the roughly 6,000 cases in which the race of the victim and the offender were known, the number of blacks killed by blacks rose to 2,380 last year, an increase of about 8 percent from 2014.

That's the real problem Kurgan.   But if you listened to BLM and their rants against police, you'd never know it."
"Steven Forth lives in a bubble or fantasy world. I am not sure if he is real or not. BUT please learn to spell. Accent is not ""accident"" and hear is not ""here"". How that a person in an inter-racial relationship can be racist to others is beyond comprehension. What is ""Black Current""? This seems offensive! You appear to be extremely racist and I expect you are the one spitting on your wife. Very Sad."
"Smooth, when Obama got elected, not only black Americans hoped the change he offered might ease the racial tensions still evident in our country, but so did many others of us.  The first black president!  Wow.  But it appears Obama's view of America was not what our country needed.  He chose to think the problems minorities face in our country was due to discrimination, when in fact the disintegration of the family, generations subsisting on welfare/food stamps, unemployment due to illegal immigration, automation, lack of quality education, etc. are the causes of unequal outcomes in our country!  The event resulting in the  ""beer summit"", and similar reactions to what is perceived as unequal deadly force against black males, seeming lack of support of law enforcement and our military, has not lessened the division in our country but only increased it under his watch."
"So both sides of Zuma Inc are firmly of the view that independent-thinking, clever-blacks are anathema to the success of the ANC. In this of course they are correct, as an intelligent individual free to pursue and understand the murky currents of South African politics could fail to see the greedy, corrupt paws of the entire Zuma clan manipulating the political axis to keep them unaccountable and out of the courts and the money continuing to being shovelled into their ever-voracious maws.

How have they hoodwinked so many in the ANC is beyond comprehension and scary in it's incredulity."
"It was in the Nixon era that American imperialism became openly fascist. The genocide based on racism in Southeast Asia and the police state occupation of black ghettos in the US, the violent repression of anti-war protesters - it was all done based on racism, love of war, disregard for the poor, with Christianity, patriotism, racial superiority, love of homeland, fueled by historical mythology.
   There was little difference between fascism in the US and fascism in 1930's Germany, Italy and Spain. As in the 1930's, fear and hatred of communism justified all the hatred and excessive violence.
  And, by the way, don't forget Prescott Bush, George Bush's father, who did a roaring business with the 1930's Nazis."
"Richard, I ALMOST bought this because for a bit you actually came off as if you were sincere.  But as you slid downhill into your typical (and pointless) partisan drivel--and then I remembered how you reviled a frail black lady who talked back to you when Face Book ran the ADN comments--she was a widow of an Iraq war vet.  And you ranted about how you wanted to ""put her in her place"".

""We will never forget"" has a variety of applications, and some of us have a whole lot more to remember than you do.  Khalas."
"The Ottomans Empire had a population of 20 million, whereas the Mughal Empire was closer to 100 million. This is like saying that the UK and the USA are equally large economies.

Second, the Ottomans did not impoverish their colonies. They didn't even convert the entire population of their Christian provinces. There is a reason Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Georgia, Armenia, Crimea, etc remained overwhelmingly Christian. Whereas Latin America, sub saharan Africa, Spain, Portugal, Sicily, etc were forcibly converted to Christianity. Surely you don't think the Christian approach was better?

I understand that you have been taught that Europeans did the Asians and Africans a huge favour by robbing them. I hope one day Asians and Africans can return the favour. That they do exactly what was done to them. According to you, it was all very uplifting and pleasant, right?"
"The only sadness appears in the blind Republican faithful who continue to send the most disgusting people to government positions expecting different results.  The primary campaign consisted of a host of wannabes trying to be as disgusting as Don Young.  The winner reflects the most disgusting one of all extolling the virtues of all that the Republican party shows to be its basic tenets of anti-government, anti-human rights, christian fundamentalism over freedom, misogyny toward women, free-market criminality based in abject greed, one of the deadly sins of their preferred religion.  Those voting Republican reflect the basic ""values"" of their leaders.  Nice to see you are so happy to wallow in that cesspool of false dogma."
"CNN, July 23, 2009: Obama defended Gates on Wednesday night, while admitting that he may be ""a little biased,"" because Gates is a friend.

""But I think it's fair to say, No. 1, any of us would be pretty angry; No. 2, that the Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home; and, No. 3 ... that there's a long history in this country of African-Americans and Latinos being stopped by law enforcement disproportionately.""

The incident, Obama said, shows ""how race remains a factor in this society."""

"Lol those are your sources? How'd those guys do on the election polls or Brexit? Why not throw Nate silvers garbage polls in there too bud. I simply typed into google American support on immigration polls. The first page which is the most viewed is entirely majority supports trumps ban. I'll follow business insider and time well over CNN or he hill. Granted it is a close poll with the undecided voters being able to swing strongly in either direction. Here's a clear poll from the EU which has by far been the most impacted by refugees and immigrants from Muslim countries predominantly. Huge overwhelming majority want it stopped. No surprise really.  Not hard to read news and see videos of the new atrocities the citizens have faced. Of course it is never aired here. Wonder why?

"The left is slowly creating a problem when people with legitimate concerns or fears on the right (not alt right who are mostly racists) are incorrectly labelled as racist. It kills any sensible discussion.
From my experience in interacting with people of color and immigrants, people of color are not crying for any one to ""fight for them"" but requesting a system that is fair to them. You are not supporting any person of color where it matters most by donating to Black Lives Matter or the far left organizations.
Simple things such as:
1) Not giving that immigrant job applicant, with appropriate qualifications but little Canadian experience, a chance to work at your company
2) Not promoting that person of color because he/she has an accent even though that person is clearly competent
3) Junior employees clearly undermining an immigrant boss because of his color despite being competent without any consequences etc etc etc
are equally as oppressive to them as those carrying racist placards."
"America has a president who encourages violence and denies the obvious reality of climate change.  To teach students to think, you have to teach them how to differentiate between truth and lies and that's no simple task when the President and governing party habitually embrace falsehood under the banner of 'alternative facts,' and 'fake news'.  I do congratulate the author on managing to  avoid using the world ""fascist' until the last line ... alas, that last line is just the kettle calling the pot black.  I tend to think attacking people for their religion is fascist ... demonizing an entire nation by calling them 'muggers and rapists' is fascist ... urging that innocent family members of terrorists be killed is fascist ... the list could go on, and on, and on.  The educational process would have a lot more success teaching students to think if the country's leaders would set an example ..."
"You insult African Americans when you act as if a few rudimentary checks on voter eligibility is somehow a barrier to them. Let me point out to you that they are just as intelligent as you are and can join the rest of us in protecting the integrity of our electoral system.
But that's really not the goal of the left is it."
"Strange, no one out on the street protesting the shooting as would be the case of a black victim."
BLM was started when a Hispanic shot a Black?  Are Hispanics one of the peoples of color?
"When is the protests against black violence? It maims, kills and terrorizes infinitely more blacks then anything else."
"I will keep saying there is nothing in the bible that says so called Christians can't bake cakes, gays can't marry or insist so called Christians should discriminate. These Bible literalist, literally can't find one passage that they can use to defend their actions. They conveniently ignore passages that cover all kinds equal sin's that is what makes this whole thing baloney. Mean while, here is the deal we live in a secular nation, annd this man can practice his religion all he wants but he cannot discriminate. Where does it end, no cakes for muslims? Blacks? Latinos? No, it is going backwards."
A big part of the problem is that liberals view these men or boys as victims not criminals. That was obvious when Obama repeatedly blamed the police in all the confrontations involving black men.
"The terrorist group BLM represents the black community today- they have allowed that, with the help of George Soros, this President, and his Justice Department. Another dark footnote in this nation's history.  Single mothers make up over 70% of black households.  Black on black murders and blacks currently incarcerated infinitely exceed other races.  Any time someone asks what the black community is doing about this, they are deemed a ""racist"" by Leftists and made to apologize.  The ""safe Space"", ""Micro-aggression"" crowd wins again- and we all lose."
"If the demands of Ndifuna Ukwazi don't make sense, it's because they don't make sense. This organization is an ANC front, serving a dual agenda: - 1) embarrass the DA administration of the W. Cape (which is open to embarrassment because of its socialist agenda + futile efforts to persuade black voters in the province) and 2) appease the Muslims in Cape Town by frustrating the efforts of a Jewish educational institution willing to pay top dollar for a property in Sea Point to operate as a school and cultural centre.

Whatever efforts the City makes towards affordable housing will never satisfy the agenda of the venomous Ndifuna Ukwazi. Best treat them as the facists that they are."
You hit the nail on the head with your concluding sentence.  To me her ignoring the important black leaders in the room is a far more egregious lack of decorum than putting her feet on the sofa.
"Not what my Sheikh says.  And he's black himself.  That whole ""black Americans cannot be racist"" slogan has been pretty much discredited."

"You use black people as a shield.
You use black people to hide behind and defend yourself.
Your attitude is ""I'm more righteous because I talk about black people"".
You use black people to build yourself up.
How patronizing and condescending of you."
"This is good spin, Larry, but it doesn't work. If racists in the South (admittedly, probably Democrats at the time) systematically kept blacks from voting (and lots of other things) for a century -- without perhaps being so stupid as to say that that's what they were doing, but in practice it was very clear -- then when it's time to change that policy, to make amends for that policy, it may be necessary to identify the racial groups that have been systematically discriminated against for decades, in order to be sure that that treatment is being corrected and reversed. That requires identifying people by race. That's not racism, that's combating racism. In the long run, we'll have a world where that won't be necessary, and then your spin will be appropriate. But, you know what they say. In the long run, we'll all be dead. You can hide from the truth if you wish, but the truth is that the Republican Party is now the party of racism and racists."
"Did Clinton refuse to rent apartments to Black people?

"For 2 months my email box filled daily letting me know you put a gold star on my posts, and on over half of my posts you replied positively and added to the debate. You even stated you wished I could be more liberal with my comments toned down for this board. Then you learned I smoke pot and now you're posting crap like this, even when you're in agreement with what I said. Does your bigotry towards pot know no shame or dignity? You're now acting like the racist who agrees with me, until he learns I'm Native American and then starts treating me like I am black. Your dysfunctional behavior is quite curious to me, and especially from a man of your age."
With all of the problems with the Black Lives Matter idiots even the radicalized Muslims any positive police.public interactions is always a positive event.  I went to a Trump for President fundraiser in Mpls last arch and talked to many BLM protesters their protesting a black guy getting killed by an officer.  There idea of protesting involved laying on a highway or the light rail train tracks which only pissed people of when they were delayed and missed appointments or work.  They looked at me like I was crazy and hassled many people when they tried to leave.  I then wrote letters to both the Mpls and St. Paul police federations asking then to meet with the residents of that community and get to know the residents and help them get ride of the gang bangers and drug dealers and end the senseless shootings and get positive publicity.  If they could go 3 months with no incidents then the MN Vikings would send some players and also pay for a community Barbecue to celebrate their victory.
His cult members should be proud that he's finally better  than the black guy at something!
"You're so cute and funny.

The gay couple isn't likely to burn a cross on your lawn and string you up.  In fact they just want a cake. 

I would guess a lot of racist folks have had their houses painted by black and mexican guys.

So yeah, you hire a house painting crew, they aren't go to runaway when they see your bumper stickers, unless they feel in danger. 

While you are at it, make sure the guy working the drive through is the same race as you are. 

Does this cake guy think he's going to be hurt by making a cake for a gay couple? Is he going to loose his soul?  We better check out scripture on that one."
"Amazing how so many are outraged by what the church did in support of their beliefs, but they turn a blind eye when Black Lives matters will only allow people of color to some events. When liberals shout down and attack those who think differently than they do. When the MSM refuses to address the issue of FGM in the Muslim community here in America but they will put this article front page. (How many will even bother to google FGM and the affect it has on women, were is their right to chose?)

The hypocrisy is rich here."
"Wayne,  how about supporting black criminals instead of the police,  supporting the Sharpton group who does nothing for the black community,  pushing Obamacare down the throats of 67% of the American people against their wishes, and on and on and on"

"As Ronald Raygun said, facts are stupid things.

There's not any evidence that three million non-citizens voted in the election.  There is evidence that the Republican Party conspired to kick off actual citizens from voting rolls if they were perceived likely to be ""voting while black.""

It's an old, tired, nasty tactic for crooks to deny everything and make counter accusation.  Make America Hate Again seems to be the plan."
"Exactly: more gun laws will not solve a cultural problem. Blacks are shooting each other and others not because of the existence of guns, but because they are caught up in a culture of gangsterism. In the UK, where guns are harder to get, they instead attack each other with knives and machetes, often in epic street battles in London. 

Most black youth go to school 'tooled up' and are quick to use knives in any dispute. This is the source of the violence and bloodshed."

"Many of the fan that left won't be returning no mater what the NFL does at this point. This crap didn't start here. It started when the NFL banned the 9/11 tribute. It started when the NFL banned the decal honoring the Dallas police officers that were murdered by a Black Lives Matter shooter. This has been a long time coming and a half-assed non-apology isn't going to cut it. The NFL is fine with promoting the Black Lives Matter narrative, it's America that they hate after all."
"Trump is showing a little too much here.  He is called a racist, bigot, and much worse by higher profile people than an ESPN host.  Yet, where is the outrage towards them?  Oooohhhh, this just happens to be a black female.  Aaaahhhh... OK."

"I watched the video, whatever the Spur released anyway, and my first reaction was 'adults, parents, behaving badly'. The man wore his male attributes outside his clothes, stopped using brain; the mother was just embarrassing, using racist language (the man too possibly). 

Quite what started it all I am uncertain, but I understand the man's child, a boy, might have been hit in a very, very, minor fracas by the woman's child... they were pre-school perhaps and the older boy complained to dad who acted out the idiot. Mother did same, effectively! 

Spur did handle things badly by effectively attributing the problem solely to the man, particularly by banning him and his family. Farrelly, that's perhaps you as Corporate?

Since then, what does one say as I live in the W Cape.....  Most certainly the Press, EWN especially behaved badly inflaming the  situation. I was unaware there was a right-wing Afrikaans Group boycotting Spur.... this is stupid.

Ban the woman, apologise to customers!"
What these femanazis fail to realize is that President Trump has employed and cut paychecks to more women blacks latinos gays lesbians transgendereds and muslims than all previous presidents combined.  Is there any way we can find out where these women work so we can boycott those businesses?
"I agree, and while youre at it, why dont you ask all blacks, browns, etc. to leave, not just BLM.  That will surely solve the non-existent problems of racism and police brutality, complaints about carding, etc. wouldnt it?  I mean all our problems would be solved if they would all just 'go back to where they came from' (given their presence in this country since the 1600s, not sure how we'd do this but am sure you could figure it out).   Sadly your comments suggest not your privilege but reflects your utter ignorance of the experience of racialised people in this country.  SMDH."
"Da, da, comrade. Doesn't matter what the facts show, you keep saying that Hillary is the bigger liar, and that someone with a ""black friend"" cannot possibly be racist, even after he BothSidered actual Nazis (besides all the other things he has done) and pardoned his good BFF and birther buddy, the racist sheriff Arpaio."
"Emotionally instabile people . There is no mechanism to lock them up. So we have to use our own judgement to protect ourselves.

"She's not just guilty of ""jumping to conclusions""--she's guilty of outright bigotry.  And my remarks represent my objection to a legitimate social/political struggle being hijacked by by a fifth column with its own agenda--an agenda which proves particularly harmful to black women in this country.

One example of this hypocrisy you seem so ready to swallow is the double-standard of lesbo-nazis promoting ""gay"" marriage out of one corner of their mouths while shrilly condemning polygynous marriage out the other."
"You're the one who basically said any blacks who support the rebel flag down south do so out of stupidity. I personally wouldn't fly the rebel flag because I have no attachment to it, but I have known some black people who have their own reasons for flying it. It's not my place to tell someone what is and is not acceptable, I'm not a member of the thought police community."
"Don't get mad at the cops. Get made at the millions of other black guys who have committed   an endless stream of mindless and violent crimes against persons, property, and society. Black guys have an 80 times greater risk of being shot by other black guys than by cops, But cops have to clean up the blood. They see it every day and their own experience forewarn them of what to expect and who they are at greatest risk from. Many innocent blacks are collateral damage in the collapse of black urban culture. Despite being just 8% of the population (yup that's all) even you must grasp how much of society's problems stem from fatherless black kids running wild."
"We have a crazy man who should never have had access to deadly weapons. He was motivated by an irrational animosity towards Republicans, it seems. That's this week's target. It could as easily have been Muslims, or Christians, or gays, or women, or co-workers (as just happened in San Francisco within the last few hours), or people of colour, or just innocent Americans going about their daily lives. The targetted groups are endless.

The common denominator is an inability to control access to guns in a way that adequately protects the American people."

"This really says a lot about Trump's perspective when it comes to seniors, the poor, and the disabled. 
When a President selects an ambassador he makes sure he selects one with great knowledge and talent in countries he considers important. But he selects his campaign supporters for countries where he just doesn't care. So if one gets a career, talented ambassador, one knows that that country is important.

Now, Ben Carson's selection says Trump just doesn't care to select someone with knowledge of the complicated life at HUD, in fact, to me, this signals that Trump will be doing what he can to pull a ""Reagan"", use tax cuts to the rich to impoverish the low income seniors and disabled people who depend on HUD housing. 
So he has selected a woman to help destroy the Department of Public Education, and a black man to help destroy HUD. 
Diversity.
Time will tell if I am being too disrespectful and fearful.

"""A lot of that has to do with the poor public schools they go to. However, it is always implied to Republican voters that the blacks are not good enough to go to college"".

How is that contradictory? Is the schooling they get is poor, it is not preparing them for college.

The solution is to improve the schools."

"What is the Black Lawmaker's agenda, to complain about Trump?
Black employment is way up under Trump.
Where is the leadership from the Black community. The only thing people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton do is victimize the Black population so as to justify their own existence. Where is the next Dr. Martin Luther King coming from?

"Who are the ruthless and uncaring rightists to whom you refer?  Are they the Christians who feed people or the Baptists and Salvation Army organizations currently helping thousands recover from hurricane losses?   Are they the tough-love folks who think able-bodied people who receive government handouts should be subject to workfare, not absolutely free fare?   Are they those who think that individuals--not big bureaucratic government--are best able to decide who gets their ""charitable"" donations?  Are they the poor Black church-going folks in the inner-cities who are clamoring for more charter schools and praying to win the lotteries to get their children into non-government schools?   Perhaps you are simply channeling Margaret Thatcher's liberal media critics or swallowing the fear-mongering served up by Schumer and others of his ilk.

"It seems that Dicks daughter is also dick. Rep. Liz Cheney (R-WY) came out in strong support of a draft executive order that suggested President Donald Trump would re-examine the use of enhanced interrogation techniques and CIA black sites that were banned under the Obama administration.

""I would support very much the idea that we're going to review and that's what the executive order does. I think that it's been clear, certainly since we stopped the enhanced interrogation program, we're not even in a position any more, frankly, where we're very often capturing people. We have nothing to do with people when we do capture them,"" Cheney said.

"Why does protesting the shooting of unarmed black men inflame race relations?

And protesting government policies and officials is the essence of America - as in ""Don't tread on me."""
"""..and what percentage of cops are guilty of this???""

Far too many.  

""Why don't we focus our energies on black on black violence in the inner city.""

You mean the cops you just defended aren't focused on that?   Well there's our problem right there.  Instead of beating and sometimes murdering black people maybe cops should focus on enforcing the law.

And personally I'm more worried about the police than I am about black people.

Black people just aren't that scary to me.   Cops who violate civil rights, ignore crime and sometimes even murder people under color of the law are much more dangerous, especially where I live."
"""Human rights, including religious freedom, will not be as much of a concern as it was during the Obama administration. This will please the Saudis, who are tired of being preached to by the Americans. ""

I'm sure Tom Reese is quite right about human rights not being on Trump's agenda, but I'm not so sure he won't preach. I can hear it now:

""You know, King Salman, if you try, you really could be more repressive. You just need to put your back into it! By the way, just so you know, it's hard to grab ***** when the women are all wearing those bulky black things. Could you do something about that? I'm just sayin'"""
"Takes a lot of nerve to ""proclaim"" people in another country ""free"". And if he was so ""anti-slavery"",why not include northern states and DC itself? The EP (finally) allowed blacks to serve in the Union forces, although free blacks served the Confederacy since 1861. (It was because of horrendous losses up through 1863! He needed bodies!)  His IRS taxed slave sales in those northern states to help fund the war (starting in 1862). It was clearly his intent to unconstitutionally prevent states from exercising their rights under the 10th amendment. He unconstitutionally waged war on another nation. (He didn't ""preserve the foundation of our nation"" as he would have to do that WITHIN the confines of the Constitution.) And who knows how TWO nations on this continent would have been significant for world history;  one (union) violating their own Constitutional limitations at will.  There IS no reason to violate the Constitution or laws for ANY reason.  Want more power? Use Article V."
"The death penalty never worked when Alaska was a territory. Vic Fischer, who was one of the delegates writing the statehood constitution said more than once it was never applied fairly. And which is why it was deleted. There were some death penalty cases that went through during the territorial days. There were four hangings - I call them lynchings - two Alaska Native men, one Black man, and a poor immigrant from Portugal -were hanged. The immigrant and the two Native men barely spoke English.

"We have been providing bombs, weapons, Intel and even refueling American made Saudi jets on their way to drop American made weapons of destruction on Yemen. And now we act outraged that someone shot a missile at us? Give me a break. We are creating over there today, the enemy we will be fighting at over here tomorrow. 

The age of the Oil Wars are over - we are now a net oil exporter. We don't need Arab dictators anymore than we need African dictators or Asian dictators as our ""friends"". We never really needed them in the first place - it was the Big Oil company folks who did. 
Military alliances should be reviewed every five years to determine if they still are worthy of our defense dollars and soldiers lives. Blindly backing dictators has backfired in our face every single time. When will our leaders learn?"

"They will claim that it isn't racism.  The funny thing is that for about the first year of Obama's Presidency, I believed them when they said it was due to policy differences.  I started noticing a trend of statements by the so called thought leaders of the right sounding more and more like people who are trying to explain that they can't be racist because they have 1 black friend or co-worker.  As time went on, it became more and more apparent that the problem wasn't policy as it was race for many on the right."
"Colin Kaepernick kneeled down in protest during the National Anthem at NFL games because of the systematic harassment and murder of black citizens by police.
 

Protest is a proud American tradition, but Donald Trump wants NFL team owners to fire any player who kneels in protest.

"On another note, American black culture gave the world jazz and blues. But then later they came up with rap and hip-hop. Wow, what happened?"
"Options abound if NFL players want to protest: Interviews; Organizing anti-discrimination groups; Giving to charities and groups so involved and others I can't think of. 
The original intent of Kaepernick was to disrespect the flag because, as he said the first time he was interviewed about it,  
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. 
""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" He deemed the entire country guilty of racism and violence against blacks when the vast majority of black killings are black on black. 
Teaching blacks to respect the police and follow lawful orders would be a really good start. Those who sow seeds of distrust of authority for political gain should be condemned."
"HI DG!  

I'm re.reading w/I wrote you & it's this:

""these ARE the people who show up when most others would run. they DO protect. they DO save lives. targeting cops or targeting soldiers - just wrong. not to say they are top notch individuals, but as a group - they deserve respect. the shooter targeted a group - i’ll bet not one cop killed had ever killed a black person - or any person. eye for an eye? not the answer""

My take and I beg your pardon if this doesn't connect because I also thought that Icon and SD were saying the same thing is the focus was this contributors (the citizen) was so outwardly racist.  That said..

I think just showing up isn't enough....they applied for the job.  It is a highly stressful job no doubt but too many folks are acting out this guys racists words and that's what the focus was about.  I really appreciate your viewpoints DG/.  That shooting is worrisome just as much as all of the African Americans are being murdered.  I value ur comments DG.

"Trump got a higher percent of the black vote in South Carolina than Nikki Haley got 2 years earlier.

tweeting out an insult and a lie that a former civil rights fighter is not doing anything for black people in America is just not an adult response. And if Trump can't refrain from taking bait and can't comport himself like an adult, he should have others speak for him - as Pence seems to be doing today."

"This article is very helpful in outlining and shedding light on the current state of governance in South Africa. There are 3 main points that I take away that I believe are useful for the broader citizenry: (1) Not about personalities, but structural. Cancer is such a useful metaphor, as explained. If we as citizens think this is about a few naughty individuals, we will wake up too late. (2)  There's opportunity to shift the discourse from ""black"" to actual social groupings that are the lived expression of frustration in South Africa: the poor, the middle class, the workers, the welfare dependent, etc. This suggests that the term ""black"" masks actual struggles of black people, and thus the term is made cheap, and useless to me as a black South African. (3) The role of ""big"" capital. Perhaps there's a way to deal with this structural problem other than a route that risks total annihilation of the whole economy to the detriment of the whole society. This point needs further thought."

It is a reflection of whether people decide education is important or not so important. Money has nothing to do with it. Schools have not been chronically underfunded. The government gives extra money to underperforming schools and free lunches. And affirmative action is forced government bias in favor of black and Latino people. And at some point it will end. We still hear excuses for why some people are lazy or unwilling to help their children. There are a lot of programs out there. But they are based on a willingness to focus.

"The 1861-65 American Civil War was between Washington and Lincoln, slave owner and Harvard educated Lawyer.

Lincoln rightly won because newly industrializing America needed labour free to move rather than slaves tied to land. That most of slaves were black is irrelevant - the war was was not about race. But the deeper social contract was never updated. Are founding fathers still relevant? America unwisely thinks yes, freezing its Constitution and tying its own hands with history.

Today, we are at the dawn of another Era of Globalization where Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa are defining a new world with NSR/OBOR, land based routes rather than sea, and new global institutions. This New World Order needs people, goods, and money freed from national borders, so do we need Obamas with their TTPs and sea lane grabs or Trumps with their walls? If America continues to fight the old war pitting Washington and Lincoln, it will be left behind.

"To attain a population for a district, Geography is pre-eminent. County lines, municipal boundaries and compactness are supposed to be the guiding lines.

A state that has 1 million people should get 2 congressional seats. If it votes 60% or 600,000 votes for one party, that party in theory should get both seats. However, if most of the majority party live in the one major city, which constitutes one of the two seats, then the state will send one representative  from each party.

No matter what you do, you cannot draw that state in such a way that you do no ""pack"" the urban voters together. A ""pie"" split of the city will not satisfy the compactness requirement, or the municipal/county line requirement.

Blacks in the U.S. at 13% of the population are empowered while in Canada they are beholding to the majority and evidently that's not working out too well.
If you read the article in the G&M on the topic, or the actual UN report, you will see that mistreatment of blacks in the U.S. isn't considered a plus for Canada. In fact, the report is about Canada and it takes all the self-serving flattery you heap on yourselves and blows it apart."

I was very insulted by Dolan describing how the $6 million raised would enable a ""poor, black woman raising a child in the inner city"" to send her child to one of their ""excellent schools."" This plays directly into Trump's characterization of the ""inner city,"" a contemporary dog-whistle that went out of fashion in the 1960s. As to whether those schools are so great, they are well known for having out-of-date curricula with underpaid teachers and embarrassing dress codes that force young women and girls to wear short skirts on the coldest of days.

"How about racists who believe blacks are inferior and they should not mingle with them? Can florists, musicians and bakers refuse service to blacks?

SOrry, but you might not be aware that ""racists"" are not a protected class. And that's a good thing.

"So, you can’t answer, huh?

(a) Perhaps Jesus was deluded, (b) the revelation continues (you’re hearing something as you read this), and and (c) the incorporation of a text into the Church’s teaching and Scripture is void if “scholars” question the attribution.

In many cases the methane in the drinking water was associated with other contamination from fracking chemicals.  These were not isolated instances.  It's quite likely that with Trump's plans to decimate the EPA and other agencies will result in less oversight of this kind of stuff.  You can be certain that the fracking industry is lobbying for relaxed regulations which they're likely to get with the Trump administration.  Maybe it's drinking water.  Maybe it's air quality or pesticides in food or...  Fear tactic?  Yeah, this kind of stuff should frighten us all."

"I didn't take her to be trashing the Gates foundation. I thought her primary criticism was of the disparity between the supports available to wealthier women, to have whatever families they like on whatever terms they like, and the resources available to poor women. She points out how the deck is stacked against the poor, and particularly women of color.  I didn't get that she thought they shouldn't have access to birth control. Rather, it seemed that she thought they should have access to humane employment, child care, health care, housing, educational opportunities, and the whole range of social goods that women of greater means enjoy, as they build and nurture their own families. Access to birth control alone is insufficient. The idea that the greatest impediment to the well-being of the poor is their own fertility is a falsehood that lets the privileged off the hook. There is a lot more than birth control that everyone should have access to. At least, that's how I read it."

"Many veterans claim to have served to protect American rights & freedoms.

How does this work?

Do the US Armed Forces function as some sort of giant civil rights organization?

Black people were still riding at the back of the bus after the big WWII victory.

Women were not allowed full voting rights at the end of WWI.

Were US troops sent to Vietnam so that Americans could be free to send letters to the editor?

Is there any case in which the US Armed Forces have been sent to distant lands on a mission to protect freedom of speech?

Is protecting freedom of speech even part of training scenarios?

Why the constant support for The Troops defending American rights & freedoms when the reality is that the US is involved in failed wars that never end.

Veterans Day was established in 1954, after Armistice Day was tossed out. How many US wars have been won since then?"
"The public had lots of say in the rules. You were free to comment on the rules during the mandatory public comment periods on draft rules before final rules were issued. And what the court ruled was Pruitt must go through the roughly two year process required by administrative law to change the rules which will include at least two public comment periods where environmentally minded citizens will file comments in opposition to his rule changes. And he will be sued if all comments are not acknowledged and responded to, with courts throwing the rules back at the agency to comply with the law on administrative procedure.

Note, the notice of comments, and of all action must be recorded in the public Federal Register so you did get official notice, and environmentalists will get notice of Pruitt's efforts so they will respond with lots of comments."

Hadyia believed that she was singled out for being black, but what she went through was a common experience of all 1st year associates.   They commonly feel used, abused, and treated like a slave.  Those who survive and achieve a rewarding legal career do so because they either love the law or they truly enjoy helping their clients succeed.  Nowhere in her article did she show any concern for the clients of these firms or the intrinsic challenge of the work itself.  The bottom line is that she quit Faskens.  Then she quit the boutique firm.  When she pursued Faskens again, they rejected her - not because she was black, but because she was a quitter."

I'm curious as to why everyone is preferring a GET increase? If residents believe that by raising the GET they won't be footing the bill, they are sorely mistaken. A rise in GE tax would only pass the burden on to residents. Companies will not foot the increase on their own, they will pass the burden on to the consumers (most of the time, the increase in pricing will not be proportional to the % increase in tax i.e. you will be paying for the increase and then some).
The state should pursue other options mentioned by Caldwell, including calling on the federal gov. to ""pony up"" more in contribution's proportionate to the cost increase and calling on the private sector to contribute (see Ala Moana), being that they will be receiving some benefit from the rail."

This Masterpiece Cakeshop case is essentially no different from a diner refusing to serve a black person.

If you're at a stable income but are constantly in the red, then you have a spending problem. For all of the Conservative waste that occurred in the last decade or so at least they were in the black.

Enough of the gang wars mentioned in the article, and above all, of a government which lacks the political will to address any of these atrocities. What about the Khayelitsha Commission? When the community went toe-to-toe with the police and demanded proper policing, when it was proved that the police presence was a joke, what has the commissioner's reaction been? Anger, dismissal, an attempt to turn it into a racist attack on Helen Zille, and a reduction in policing numbers! Yes, #BlackMonday highlighted the farmers, but if you are so concerned, Mr Van Heerden, join the movement and extend its activities!"

"The mayor has been forced into an untenable position by Morgan, Weber and Pepper (MWP).  The mayor is the ONLY reason we still have a functioning City.
Example: April 2016 Morgan refused to bring the replacement of the outdated and failing water chlorinating system to a vote because it ""benefited the developer"", and Pepper backed her.  Neither of them are on City water so failure of the system would not affect them.  It was forced to a vote and passed when Weber, who is on City water, finally broke from them and voted to replace.
Weber's budget violated State law in many areas and was not balanced.  The State demands the budget be balanced.  The mayor cannot sign illegal legislation.  Benson had to veto it.
If the mayor had not been standing for the City, it would have been shutdown in 2016.  She has had to take steps simply to continue to provide services to the people of Black Diamond, the people that MWP have demonstrated they care nothing about.
We must retain Mayor Benson!"
"Ineed, intent is, IMO, very important in this incident and every incident of behavior which smacks of racism, misogyny, homophobia, or any other bias, discrimination or perceived""hate speech.""  To contend otherwise is, in my view, as clueless as Ms. Shurtz's wearing blackface.  

President Schill is bending to the political climate on the U of O campus.  To me this doesn't represent leadership, but rather cowardice.  The most extreme factions on campus are demanding Ms. Shurtz's resignation or dismissal.  Schill supports those demands and, at the same time weasels behind ""due process"" concerns...a classic CYA maneuver.  

He touches on ""forgiveness"", but such discussion really requires a consideration of intent...a topic he  dismisses early in his email address.  Does the University need to be more ""inclusive"" and more open  to minority students AND faculty? Of course it does. At the same time it needs to embrace understanding, compassion and forgiveness..they're not mutually exclusive"
"Somehow it was Trump who brought up Ted Cruz's place of birth. And his father was also a Cuban. It was his mother who was American. 

The Democrats never brought up McCain's place of birth. But in the 2000 primaries, GW Bush's team passed out a rumour that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi child was his love child with a black woman. That caused him to lose the South Carolina primary, and other primaries. 

https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2004/11/mccain200411

McCain's daughter stated in an interview that her family refused to vote for GW Bush in 2000 and 2004, due to this underhanded tactic."

"Charles ...not everyone looks to the government to pay all of their bills and supply them with every one of life's little pleasures ...pay their power/rent/daycare/buy their food/day care/health care.  They also don't value their own lives based upon what the government thinks its value is. When rural people fall on hard times they don't start crying for another government program to take care of them ... they look at each other and they look first at themselves first. Secondly, rural people may seem poor to a stranger looking from outside but most of those families think they live blessed lives and even find a way to give to other people. Poverty is a state of mind and people are responsible for their own happiness ...not the government. Don't you see how the left uses black people every 2 years then kick them to the curb in favor of the next up and coming victim class ...Hispanics!"

"""On a summer afternoon in 1994, David Guttenfelder took a taxi from the Rwandan capital Kigali to the nearby region of Bugesera. He walked inside the Ntarama Church and began taking photographs of people who had been murdered by their neighbors. They had come to the small, red-brick church from all over the area seeking refuge—just as their parents and grandparents had come in the past when violence broke out between the ethnic majority Hutus and minority Tutsis. But this time the church, like many others in Rwanda during the genocide, became a killing ground.

Thousands of bodies—old men and women, young men and women, boys and girls, toddlers and infants—filled the entire sanctuary. “People piled on top of one another, four or five deep, on top of the pews, between the pews, everywhere,” he said.
 
In this archival photograph taken in 1994, survivors of a massacre in Nyakizu, Rwanda, stand outside the Cyahinda parish church where villagers said 4,000 to 5,000 people were killed."""
"Here's a valid hypothetical (and why ""reasonable doubt applies"") 

Woman ""simply got drunk"".
Gave her consent and had sex.
Changed her mind after the fact or had a black out and doesn't remember.
Files charges.. ruins man's reputation regardless of the legal outcome, possibly resulting in incarceration despite having obtained consent.

Was someone hurt as the ultimate result of her getting drunk?  Yup.  Same situation.  Your logical flaw is that you say ""she got drunk.  being drunk hurts no one"" then end the scenario.  In the workplace scenario you could say the same ""he got drunk. being drunk hurts no one"" then end the scenario... you're comparing apples to kumquats and describing the taste of OJ..."
"Charles:  I agree with you.  I'm interested in your opinion regarding ""forgiveness"" in this incident.  I don't feel Ms Shurtz had malicious intent.  As I read her C.V., she seems a very decent person.  Posts from former students support this as well.  I've also read her comments and her apology.  You're an African American and you, not me, have been directly insulted my her actions.  How do you feel about forgiveness for Ms Shurtz's actions?  Thanks, Gary"
"How long do you think it would take to find a solution if this problem were impacting the good folks living in Montreal's Westmount, Vancouver's Shaughnessy or Toronto's Bridle Path?

But this flow of illegal migrants into Canada is only going to impact the poor sluggos who occupy the bottom rungs of the economy. And they simply count for nothing in the political calculus.

The PM and his fellow one percenters are never going to have to compete with these new arrivals for scarce social housing, for black market construction jobs or find themselves in emergency wards filled with people who have never contributed a dime in taxes. So we will simply get empty platitudes about Canada being a land of immigrants and no stopping of the flow.

Diversity is our strength"

"This is why we kneel. We don't use these incidents to riot and vandalize other people's property and commit acts of violence towards LEO in the name of BLM. Baltimore caused millions of dollars in damage punishing and running lives of hundreds of people that had nothing to do with the incident that ""started"" the riot. Baltimore was not an example of BLM, it's an example of thugs being thugs and hate perpetuating hate. More importantly, riots are an example of black turning against black, LEO and justice. I commend the athletes who kneel, they found a way to show that BLM, that is about standing up for people who have been bullied by LEO. I support students kneeling. We all have minorities, friends, family, coworkers and neighbors who depend on LEO to protect, not persecute. Let's show the world what America and Patriotism mean. Let's show our children we can agree to disagree and we stand up for equality and rights for all Americans. Peaceful Protest. Time to heal, not hate."
"It can get pretty hurtful having pastors like that, When my wife and I were planning our wedding, we considered that our families speak different languages, so we kindly asked our priest if we could have some portions of the mass in Latin, then everybody would be on equal footing since no one side would understand more than the other.

He freaked out, and dropped all contact with us, the only time we got an answer from him was when we wanted to transfer to another priest to help us get married. Really sad when a priest can't see beyond his ego, for him anything that even smelt of pre 1960 was anathema. 

He could have just said no, right then and there or kindly referred us to someone else, instead of coming with an outburst and then blacklisting us. 

It goes both ways of course, and I am sure there are traditionalist priests that only do things their way instead of meeting the laity on their level and guiding them higher."

"No it doesn't.       Presidential authority has nothing to do with race in the modern US constitution.

One way to get clarity on the boundaries of law with such action is to take it to court.    

Did you hear President Obama insult the competence or suggest bias on the part of the Judge in this case?     

Ask the President if time spent in court isn't part of the 'game' when you play hardball.    He's quite familiar with the process.

I've know some Hank Williams types and they can be 'anti' about anything when they get to drinkin.  The can also be great fathers, hard workers, honest, brave, trustworthy.......    I know many are biased about black culture, most would never do anything to a black person without extreme provocation.

"Um - it depends on the comments. Years ago, I had coworkers saying very nasty things about a black woman they had seen at a bus stop. I asked them to stop. They said ""what, you LIKE those people?""

"I'm no great fan of Trump for POTUS but, if it's him or Hillary, I'll vote for him over a lying, conniving, incompetent  ""what difference does it make"" Hillary.  Trump has shot himself in the foot more than once, but I'm fed up with top-feeders like The Clintons who think it's their turn because they've been in the game a long time and/or are the desirable race/gender for another First (Black, Female, ,etc.) President-thing.  The main reason Trump gets terrible press is the terrible press.  They forgive or overlook Hillary and other Democrats' every flaw (yes, they do have huge flaws), and nitpick ad nauseum everything Trump does--or any other Republican.   Of course, we know the Democrat Monarchy will always win in provincial, dysfunctional Hawaii, so there's almost no point in someone like me voting.   Dems are likely counting on that, but I will do my civic duty, knowing that there are three certainties in life--death, taxes and a DDD Hawaii--Destructive, Dysfunctional, Democrat."

Taxes should be less than they are in the US, because most of the money is wasted."

"I've wondered about this and would like to know how many protesters, before and now, didn't vote... no one knows.   It was said a lot of millennials and blacks didn't vote, or voted with third party ""protest"" votes (which Bernie Sanders warned against).   Some will get a lesson about the importance of voting - some need to be reminded what the GOP did to the country last time.   BUT (I just looked it up) the total of presidential votes cast in 2012 and 2016 were 129,075,630 and 136,628,459 respectively... so 7.5M more people participated in 2016.  I suspect this is because most ALL who supported Trump voted, so he's lucky so many didn't vote.  You're right that those who don't vote shouldn't complain, but we'll see what happens during midterms in 2018."
"What can the Republicans do now, since the majority of their ""base"" have been encouraged to feed their fears, to fear African Americans, Muslims, LGBT people, to think that disparaging women is just ""locker room talk""?  I do think this started with people like McConnell and before that with someone like Gingrich - who turned demonizing the opposition into an art form.  It was fed through the years of the Obama presidency by those who refused to work with Obama or the Democrats in Congress - would rather let the government shut down than compromise.

I know these attitudes do not describe all conservatives - I know quite a few - some in my own family - and they are nice, smart people.  But they shrug this off or agree with one or two of these fears but have bought into the demonizing of Hillary.  

Where and how do decent Republicans start over, bring a sense of cohesiveness rather than divisiveness?  I don't know."
"The GOP's relentless obstructionism during the Obama years didn't provoke enough outrage to cost the Republicans politically. It's dereliction of duty as far as I'm concerned. (Still no movement on filling that vacancy on the Supreme Court!) Yet a generic Republican would've had a good shot at beating Hillary.

Many voters just don't care that much about trying to get a grasp of facts and the historical dynamics driving American politics. It's more about personal pique and truisms about the process."

"Which historian has argued that significant numbers of black troops fought for the CSA? Where? Using what sources? You're making  a fabulously provocative claim w/out any sources. 

The only thing I know like that concerns a group of free men of color in New Orleans who tried, unsuccessfully, to enlist in the Confederate forces as a unit, The Louisiana Native Guards.

When Union forces took New Orleans in 1862(?) however,  the Native Guards enlisted in the UNION army. They guarded POW's in coastal Mississippi and fought at the Battle of Pascagoula . . . for the Union. 

Black Union troops fought heroically at any number of battles, often suffering horrendous casualty rates: Port Hudson, Fort Pillow, Battery Wagner, Nashville, the Battle of the Crater and others. 

Where did black CSA troops do this?

It happened so fast that neither woman had time to deploy bear spray initially, Murphy said. Trainor reportedly sprayed the black bear twice, he said, which likely saved her life.

The bear retreated for a short time but returned, Murphy said. It came back more than once, he said.

"That comment points to what I mean about Catholic economics -- typically viewing the term ""wealth"" as a dirty word connoting sin, when it simply means an economy that's in the black (through capitalism) and generates prosperity  for all.

"Thank you, HM, for what may well have been an unintended consequence of exposing the essence of this forum's inveterate moralist.

And Mencken, as everyone knows, was fascinated by Nietzsche. Yes, it all makes sense now. Just as that young boy's dream never escaped the sandlot, our Mencken worshipper's limits are circumscribed by carefully cataloged op-ed filler masquerading as reason and pith.

A side note: Check out ""Men versus the Man: A Correspondence between Robert Rives La Monte, Socialist, and H.L.

"While there are decent passages in this address, overall it's so bad one wonders where to begin. What would a person unfamiliar with the alt-right take away from this rambling, unfocused piece? What characterizes the alt-right? Does it have a coherent ideology? Is it simply an internet phenom, a cohort of ideologically aligned, discrete far-right factions, a transnational eruption manipulated by political operatives? What distinguishes the alt-right from more traditional conservatism? Rather the audience is advised to dog-ear a critique of the Enlightenment and be sure to finger-wag Black Lives Matter.

As for the KKK activists, in the scenario that occurred, they were simply gathered to protect the statue of Robert E. Lee, and in that single case, I agree with them-not the counter protesters  actions which toppled and destroyed it. But I cannot explain that either. We see that destruction of statues with ISIS when they claim a location, but I never thought we would see it in America. Sadly, I was wrong.

To close: 
You ask: If the Confederacy had actually won the Civil War, what do you think would have happened to the black slaves who couldn't escape?

I think that life would have continued, and very sadly, the slaves would be owned as they were.  For it was the Dems (at that time) who fought slaves freedom."
"I read this with appreciation for it's insight, clarity as well as the feelings of good will even as Mr Konar expressives his profound disappointment in the current state of our country.  He hits on multiple points in which the change of heart goes from generosity to selfish, meanspirited fear in seemingly in one or two generations.  
Social conditions and access have improved during that time for women, blacks, gays, transgenders,  physically hadicapped, etc which provides a sense of a more open society.  But the Trump phenomenon seems to have opened a floodgate of hate and revenge.  
Also he touched on the message of prosperity now promoted by evangelicals that has replaced the 10 commandments and other teachings that presented ethical behavior as a spiritual value.  That view is as celebrated as it is base.  
But let's not lose sight of  our community's churches and organizations such as Saint Vincent de Paul who use their resources to provide for the homeless and less fortunate."
"Harry, no, no, no...clearly you haven't been paying attention to how the left operates.  We can't punish the vandals and desecrators because they're just expressing their anger at our rotten society.  We must try to understand the vandals and desecrators' points of view and adapt to them so those otherwise fine folks won't have to vandalize and desecrate public property again in the future.  You know...kinda like the Black Lives Matter gang."
"Actually you are wrong.  A REAL ""assault weapon"" is a military grade weapon.  These would be fully automatic, defined above.  What they call as ""assault rifle"" for  purposes of banning them, is a scary black gun.  That's the only difference.  I've seen a video of someone taking a plain wood-stocked rifle and swapping the stock for a black one, swapping the magazine for a banana clip and- voila!- what they call an ""assault rifle"" only it's the same gun as it was before.  An unless you are using a muzzle-loader or a machine gun, your gun is ""semi-auto"".  I think people are meant to fixate on ""automatic"" but nearly every gun in civilian use is ""semi-auto"".  One trigger pull, one shot.  (PS.  I looked for the video to include the link but did not find it.)"
"Ordination as WE know it today had its Roots in the times of Constantine.
The Male Clergy of the Catholic church [the ONLY  Christian organization in town] took on the Roles of Elite Rulers. They even took a lot of the robes and hats to show the various status groups. Even had certain chairs they sat in while at church.
Pious Women were URGED by the Men to enter Castles and pray, if they wanted a REAL part in Church. They were also clothed in black from head to toes, to wrists with only faces and hands showing. The MEN had the keys and locked them in and called the places Convents.
Pious Women in N. Italy, Central Europe were chased from place to place because they were unauthorized Female preachers [not men]. We still have some of their writings.
What I am trying to say is that Ordination as WE SDA's know it has its roots in OUR Catholic ancestors through Anglicans, Lutherans, Baptists, Methodists [Ellen and others], Presbys.
It has NO Biblical ROOTS."
"Bobcaygeon, where the men are men and the sheep are nervous."
"Clearly you are a multi-skilled person and can achieve anything that you set your sight on. Well, it is a wild guess - you will be writing an excellent novel soon.

As  a socially colour-blind person,  it is difficult to comprehend significant focus on the natural nature of a person, being proud.  ""And as a person of colour, these are roadblocks at every step along the way."" Well, true. So did  the Irish, Italians, Jewish and, Ukrainians had gone through so that the next generations are ok. Yet primarily Italians mix around with other Italians and not in Irish bar. 

You have to remember: pennies make pound; each is a penny, got to withstand  the environment for the other penny to join. If you have spent it none left.   Rome wasn't built in a day.  Changes in the last 50 years are phenomenal in Canada. You will be an excellent seed for the future generations. It will be safe bet that your  appraisal in another 50 years will be "" what the hell was I writing about fitting in 2017."""
"First Harper ""failed"" in his duty despite apologizing in Parliament then Trudeau ""failed"" despite giving billions in new funding with no strings attached. Dissolve the Indian Act and move forward, the current system has failed conclusively, especially for Northern reserves that rely exclusively on government handouts. Rather than spend another 50 years with threats of violence, settle this issue now and move forward. If First Nations want conflict then let them have it."
This comparison is unfair to adolescent girls.
"Black Swan,

An exceptionally well articulated post. A real contribution."
"I think it's wrong in the sense that, 1. most manuals recommend not just red to red, but start with one battery (which one, I forget) and 2. ground to the frame, not to the dead negative.  (I saw, and agree with, your comments on that above.)  I had fun recently, dead battery, bought a charging pack, tried to boost, probably f'd up getting a good ground (I tried a dozen times.) then had my girlfriend call CAA.  He came, red to red, black to black - bammo - car's running.  GF pretty much insisted that I ask him what I was doing wrong - ah, do I have to? - and he said basically, ground to frame is nice in theory and maybe adds a small sliver of safety, but it's hard to get a good ground, black to black is fine in the real world.  You know, except for a very small chance the battery explodes, blinding you in one eye and horribly scarring you for life while your GF runs off with the CAA guy.  Again, my point is that I shouldn't be allowed anywhere near jumping a car."
"Taking a knee is confronting problems in the country, not turning your back,  The NFL aren't shooting black men in alarming numbers in the US so taking a paycheck from them is not hypocrisy.

Really - what are you talking about?

Trump has the backing of every bigot in the US, that's is truth."
"The ceremony is a moral aberration that presumes culpability for acts committed in the past. Anyone living today is not morally responsible for the unjust acts of their ancestors. If this were true I am sure we could find a list of ""evils"" committed by the ancestors of the blacks  that are being told how bad the Jesuits were/are. 

 Yes a number of Jesuits betrayed the name of Jesus, a long time ago, but WE have not.  We can not ask for forgiveness for what the dead have done, and the decedents can not give forgiveness. This is funny theology with funny consequences, and has nothing to do with  Catholic morality.  

One consequence is that it undermines the idea that the individual is saved from sin. If I am responsible for all the sins of my (human) race,  one wonders if I can ever be forgiven. Christ frees us from the sins of the past and urges us to go forth in a life of grace. This is spiritual scruples on steroids. Mea culpa that never ends."
"Not all of them but many of them are for agreeing with Trump about blacks, women, the disabled, etc., etc., etc.. Being American does not mean being conservative only."
"Some good points.  But you can point out crime with guns in any big city and the response by those who want stricter gun laws will be the same.  They will divert the discussion any way they can because ""guns are the problem.""  Chicago is the point of discussion because it has so much black on black crime that liberals don't want to talk about.  And so much murder almost daily.  BTW, if you want to offer a web site other than wiki, I will be glad to take a look."
The new law in California on background checks for ammo will surely promote a black market for it.
"More chat, no action.  And, of course, no penalty for bishops refusing to play the game."
I also feel sorry for the black lady as KPMG gives a ton of weights to her to deal with messes made by previous officials.
And there you have it. People like you are the reason Black Bloc is back. Expect to see more of them.  I'm only surprised it took so long for them to manifest.
"Of course not. They are simply another tool in the box. We aren't all black belts, you know. Some might even be disabled."
"This article highlighted the unpublisised and unacceptable  violence happening to fellow South Africans, an outcry for help!!! I also aggree that the old South African flag belongs in the past and evokes unneseccary hatred and devide, even amongst farmers. Its time that we stand together as fellow South Africans and stop propagating race or colour. Many political partries thrive on spreading devide through race and colour sepratism. Fellow South Africa, I hear your pain about the flats and fellow South African, I hear your pain about murders on farms. Lets propagate unity through our speach and action in our beloved country."

"6 weeks ago the Rockies were a different team.  Then people started seriously talking playoffs.  Since then, it appears to be a different bunch.  Used to be they went out, played the game for fun, and enjoyed it.  Now they go out, play the game seriously, and do not appear to be enjoying it.

Black needs to do something to get the guys playing loosely as they did at the beginning of the year."
"In the recent Milwaukee incident, a black police officer shot an 18-year old black man who turned toward the officer with a gun in his hand.  The deceased had 13 previous arrests, including one for a previous shooting.  I fail to see reason for the ""community"" to burn and trash their city in response."
"every parish has one of those at one time or another.   when I was 12 the associate pastor was a Father What-a-Waste.  6'2"",  one of those gorgeous black Irish priests, black hair and heavy blue black beard, muscles, dimples and a smile that would melt the Blarney Stone, which judging by his charm he had not only kisses, but had also bitten off a chunk and swallowed it!   very good priest too, giving, loving, caring and utterly devoted to his parishioners, his only failing was that he was a liturgist.  LOL"
Black Lives Matter is Wrong about Banning Police You Can't Tarnish a whole Police Force because you didn't like the actions of one or two members. Police are For our Protection.
"So what do you think a manager ought to be accountable for?  Wins and Losses?  8 years with the Padres, 649 wins and 713 losses, no post seasons, two close but no cigar.  I am not involved with Rockies baseball enough to know who the other candidates might have been, nor do I care.  I am just expressing my opinion that Black can't -- or at least hasn't yet -- closed out a winning season.  Do you dispute that?"
"anniec, thank you.  I think it would not be good for all of Christianity if it were ""under one roof.""  In fact, I suspect that the number of different Catholic groups will continue to grow, recognized or not.  I think of groups of Catholics who accept women priests, or Catholic churches that recognize LGBT marriage.  The Catholics who worship there still consider themselves as ""Catholic"" even if some other Catholics don't and the official RCC doesn't.

I would think that some cultural differences in Africa, Asia, Latin America, among Native Peoples here - if incorporated into how they practice faith and even into some differences in what they believe would actually make Catholicism more ""at home"" within those cultures.  I am thinking of cohabitation in Africa after parents have arranged a marriage but before the bride price is paid - a practice that seems to work in their cultures but would not/does not work in others.  Why not recognize this?"
"For a Liberal Lefty to accuse Trump of not telling the truth is like the kettle calling the pot black. Not ""yammer on"" , just drawing attention to the duplicity of the Liberals or is that not allowed by this  Government."
"Maybe not only did the Kremlin want ""pay-back"", maybe millions of ""deplorable"" voters in the U.S. also wanted pay-back? By Hillary Clinton's calling voters bad names, that probably gave those voters more motivation to actually show-up at the polls. Meanwhile there were Black American commentators who told their audiences: ""We are being used by the Democrats"".  That message probably kept a lot of voters at home when in previous elections, they came out and voted for Obama.

South Park's parody of Hillary Clinton's debating style, while being extremely exaggerated,  might also have also triggered the notion in voter's minds that there was, in fact, a germ of uncomfortable truth in that parody."
"This call for resignation says more about the Stalinist/Mob Rule flippancy of the UO elite than does ""blackface"" costumes, this is a ""Black Mirror"" moment where people are so ready to shut down perceived threats than stand up to free speech. Was it right? don't know, don't care, but the mob will come for us all one day; just say the wrong word, make a mistake and your friends and colleagues will throw you under the bus to appear as one of the herd. Shame."
"As a concerned former HPD Officer, I see the department crumbling from within.  There seems to be no pride nor concern for outstanding IMAGE in the eyes of the public.  

I have witnessed an office serving as a special duty officer on Waialae Ave in Kaimuki without his uniform wearing shorts and a bulky vest with ""POLICE"" on the back of the bulky vest; a special duty officer sitting on his bag chair at the intersection of Woodlawn Drive and Alani Drive; an officer picking up his child at Stevenson Middle School in his black car with its blue light on...probably on duty at the time;  officers smoking while on duty in public; etc; etc; etc.

I guess the current mayor is either blind or not concerned with the negative image or the lack of pride exhibited by ""his"" police department and the obvious politically motivated inaction his is taking with Taketa.  It seem like most of the Commissioners are appointed because of a political favor or guarantee a large number of votes for the mayor."
"It’s interesting to speculate on this stuff as lay people, for sure.  My kids have always been interested in space, and often flummox me with questions like “If the universe is infinite, how can it be expanding?”

The best I can offer is that while black holes consist of unbelievably dense matter, that matter still has to occupy space…..and if more matter is sucked into them, they would get bigger.  

Quite honestly, these kinds of questions start to hurt my head sometimes, and I have been known to surmise that theoretical physicists operate on the same plane as Zen Buddhists – contemplate unanswerable questions like what is the sound of one hand clapping in order to clear the mind………"

"Agirl:  I suggest you read the accounts from those persons at the party.  Absolutely no one asserts that Ms Shurtz was being intentionally insulting or mocking African Americans.  In fact the overwhelming majority of letters to the editor addressing this issue run very parallel to my feelings.....Mr Shurtz was attempting to honor Dr. Tweedy and used poor judgment by donning black make-up.  I use the term ""black make-up"" instead of ""blackface"" because the latter term implies racism and the mocking of African Americans with intent.  Again, no one asserts, (even in the ""so-called"" investigation) that such was Ms. Shurtz's intent.  

Photo:  Would you suggest Ms. Shurtz should have shaved her head to portray Dr. Tweedy?  

I'm not sure of the point of your post.  Do you suggest that Ms. Shurtz deserves to be dismissed from the University?  Do you feel the resign/be dismissed punishment the petitioners desire is appropriate?  Those are two questions for you.....thanks for answering them."
"He's the son of a KKK aupporter who was arrrested for causing a riot at an anti immigrant rally, and he settled out of court for discrimination against Black tenants.
It's hilarious how Fred Trump, Donalds father, protested against immigrants when he was the son of immigrants..."
because he wanted noting to do with them. Remember Black September?
What a joke!  The mayor is so out of touch with the public.  The African American community doesn't event respect him.  Business is all that is on his mind!
"I am not the one ignorant of reality in this discussion.  I have pointed out that refugees have certain rights and exemptions that are different from other migrants - black letter law.

What you think the majority of Canadians may want is immaterial if it contravenes our supreme law and that has been so since 1982 when the Constitution was patriated and the Charter passed into law.

Since international and domestic law allows refugees claimants to enter Canada by any means necessary and make a claim as Convention refugee and they are entitled to legal representation, why would lawyers be disbarred?  You did read the recent SCOC decision that struck down the amendments to the human smuggling provisions of the IRPA as ""overbroad"" did you not?  See R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59

The is no chance of Canada withdrawing from international conventions and agreements on refugees.

The safe third country agreement is the government exploiting a loophole in the Singh decision."
"I'll take Black Lives Matter's history of protest over Trumps' KKK supporter's history. 
Since the election things have been amazingly calm on the streets of America other that a few minor scuffles and shoving matches.  Get real...That happens everyday in America with or without Trump.

Again you have no idea what a riot is."
"I was at the Black Pearl on August 18th and nothing like that occurred.  Mary Doyle Hoover is correct in that the incident happened in April.  I doubt that Johnny and Denise threatened anyone.  Especially Denise as she is so kind and calm.  The threats may have come from regulars who may in their own choice, choose not to accept LGBTQ individuals.  This is a small town with old ideas for some that don't necessarily match the current acceptance agendas of our times.  But to hold that against Johnny and Denise is wrong.  I believe that it is frightening to business owners that rogue groups can come into their businesses, act inappropriately with customers and the owners and then cry prejudice and discrimination when nothing happened of that sort.  If the people involved were threatened with violence, why didn't the police show up or even get called?  Is there a legal record of that happening?  A mature person would take responsibility for their actions and not do this to anyone."
Do some research. That report was based on stats compiled by a Muslim organization in Canada. They have a site where Muslims can just click to report they've been discriminated against. Hardly a reliable barometer of Islamophobia. Canada doesn't do nearly as many studies as the US as we don't have a highly developed victim/lawyer industry they way you do in the states. We also don't include the value of lawsuits in GDP stats. Did you see the report on the treatment of blacks in the US? Debunks the US.
"This a waste of our tax payer money right now and sorry to say is not the root of cancer dilemma here or america anymore. When I was a child there were ads on t.v with Joe camel and the Marlboro man. If you go back another twenty teachers were allowed to smoke in class. Smoking was the normal. Now there is no smoking  In schools and so forth dont smoke In cars with other people who dont smoke And so on. Smokers in general are much more few and far between then back then. Yet cancer rates and even diabetes rates have more than doubled? And they keep going up? Maybe look to the real culprits next time. Or even better spend that money on the real crisis in Alaska. Our prescription pill, Heroine and Meth population is going through the roof. Little known tid-bit for those who aren't In touch with society today. When you give someone presc. Pills and then take them off it later if they are addicted they will move right over to heroine. Thanks Doc! #WhyDontWeDoSomethingthatmatters!"
"With enthusiastic community support, the city of Eugene fittingly passed a resolution declaring the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Why? Because Columbus Day represents the brutal genocidal ethnic cleansing of the Americas.  
Yet what was our community's response to University of Oregon's ""Israel block party"" where the brutal genocidal (still ongoing) ethnic cleansing of Palestine was not condemned but celebrated? How can Arab or Muslim or Palestinian students feel safe at our university when UO-affiliated Jewish organizations hold a ""block party"" celebrating the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine and promote the IDF? What would it take for our community to understand that Palestinians, including refugees, might feel the same way about the flag of Israel that Blacks might feel when they see the Confederate flag or that Jews might feel when they see the Nazi Party flag? Has allegiance to Israel, a country that bans return of refugees it has created, replaced theology?"
India most definitely is 3rd world.  And Indians are needed desperately back in India.  The country is short a half billion flush toilets and all the infrastructure to support such.
"Yeah... I understand why they feel a need to protect themselves but this business of never compromising their own safety, ever, does seem a bit over-done. It makes me respect them a bit less.

I also feel like the whole Black Lives matter movement missed the mark. It should have been (Not Only Cops) Lives Matter. Not quite as catchy, though."
"You say you are not his mistress, but what is with the personal attacks by on anyone who does not support Fred Stewart?  You claims the writers are racist to report this story and are afraid to have a black man on city council?  What is strange about that is that not even the black community in this city support Fred.  Fred’s politics are more Donald Trump than anything.  He is pro gentrification and against gang outreach programs.  

What would make you stay up to 2:30 this morning posting stuff like this on Fred’s person page (it’s public people, take a look for yourself Is this the sort of drama around your public officials?  If this is ok on his social media, would it be ok to say these things to anyone in City Hall?  

Apologies to Mark Zusman, Nigel Jaquiss & even Nigel’s wife; but people deserves to know what to expect if they vote Fred.  

This race is about “anyone but Novick” but look close and it’s “anyone but Novick or Stewart”"
Why do you have to support unchecked illegal immigration and open border in order to reach out to hispanics?!!
"In 1936-39, British forces and jewish terrorist groups massacred 5% of the palestinian population  - this was the start of the ethnic cleansing that has been going on since then. The jewish terrorists would then commit terrorist acts on the british soldiers -  the same british forces that liberated their cousins from Nazi forces. The british govt looked the other way as their forces consisted mostly of african soldiers"
"Elshikh’s mother-in-law will most likely have her visa application processed during the temporary 90 day entry ban.

It's sad that people will hate other people just because of their religion.  The attempt to prove that Trump dislikes Muslims ironically may encourage the haters.

"Does ""our own"" include black and brown people?"
"Police officers have led to the murders of blacks, so now where are we? Well, I'll tell you. Out of the two groups, only one swears an oath to uphold the law, the cops, yet they do not hold up the law. In fact, they use their government granted powers to commit crimes against innocent people, notably blacks."
"Who:  I think we could spend unending time blaming each other.....liberals blame the conservatives; conservatives blame the liberals; Blacks blame the police; police blame the Black community.  Republicans blame President Obama; Democrats blame President Bush. and so forth.  What would it accomplish?  A great deal......and none of it good.  How about us all looking at the situation and trying to do our small part to help make things better.  Things are a real mess. The level of trust between the police and much of the Black community is a as low a level as I've seen since the pre-Civil Rights days.  I we can't all work together to make things better, they're only going to get worse.  I agree with your (unstated) suggestion.....we do, indeed, need to ratchet-down the rhetoric.  regards, Gary"
"All I want is for the police to stop killing unarmed black people including children. I consider that state sponsored murder with the police union contracts defending that behavior. The police have never thought protecting and serving black Americans as a priority. In fact, they have been known to work with the Klan to murder black folks over the years."
"""bigots in South Africa are like bigots in the US, nothing but ignorant, thuggish racists.""  

And yet, on the telly, they all appear to be the same skin color! 

An Interesting definition of 'racist' by you there, ""Baas"", (as you might be referred to in Afrikaans)!  

Those arrested in South Africa were black residents  beating on other blacks who were illegal  immigrants whom the residents blamed for taking their jobs and livelihoods.   

Any ""Racism"" is only seen through racist eyes; yours.  

Which could have been avoided if you had actually read the story instead of having that little knee-jerk thing happen."
"Only the ignorant think this is about skin color.  I thought the bus driver who was assaulted is black. 
Race card FAIL as usual."
There will be race riots and cities across America will burn if black folks on welfare and food stamps are expected to clean hotel rooms or flip burgers.
Unfortunately  so many of these rappers have help destroy Black culture.  Sad very sad.
"You have a better level of experience than some, but you are still not black nor have you lived in black neighborhood.   My relations were mostly assoicated with my education.  These were most guys recruited in St. Louis, Kansas City and amazingly several from New York.  They had been in street violence, some rough neighborhoods.  I also stayed a week in a St Louis projects area, there only by permission of local gang agreement through a church in that interacted with my college professor.. Gunshots heard at night were common.   But that was 1975 and things change.   It was a short experience a long time ago.

So anyway, what did you learn from those black guys in the army."
"Exactly. If he was black, BLM wouldn't protest his death because he was armed and posed a real threat. Throwing hatchets at the police is a good way to catch a bullet. APD isn't in the habit of shooting unarmed citizens and I don't expect that to change no matter what their ethnicity is."
You failed to address my points. When will black Americans take responsibility for their conduct?
"I heard about Leah McLaren from comments in Margaret Wendt's article about Are Today's Dad's really so pathetic? I had to check it out. And I have kept an open mind.  But, reading her (McLaren's) work is like pulling hangnails. She has some good points, but her smugness against dads is quite telling. Her use of slang like 'snowflakes' and 'whevs' ('whatever' in a valley girl dialect?) is instructive. She talks about how much praise to give to children THEN switches to husbands, speaking as though men are like children and women are the adults who have to train their dogs. Her condescension is appalling. 

One reason I am writing here is that Father's Day articles give back-handed insults to men. (""Kids are fat? - Blame dad"") Happy Father's Day! Ms. McLaren should follow Janice Fiamengo who mentions the difficult, dirty, dangerous jobs done by men who get no gratitude. Bill Burr quipped ""All the mothers with black lung!"" And Oprah telling men to ""BE BETTER!"" a year ago with Ms. Obama."
"Horribly written articles like this are why newspapers are dying. The article is 2 paragraphs and 1 sentence long stating that ""black students and teachers face inequities"" and that 11 recommendations were made, yet they aren't listed, nor are the challenges that black students and teachers face. Since there was no data provided, what was the point of this article?"
"Thanks for making it clear that you don't understand the issues. No one is protesting that stuff. 100% of shark attacks happen in water, but no one is protesting that. You must wonder why. You must also wonder why the Police Benevolent Association is not the American Heart Association. You must think that police don't care about heart disease. Earn your GED and learn that Kaepernick and the others are protesting the issue of their choice (freedom of America, right?), and that issue is dirty cops killing blacks. Period."
"The two examples given involved professional protestors.  They were looking for a fight.  Used their ""blackness"" as a weapon.  Unfortunately for American Airlines or any business, it's a no win situation.  Blacks hurt their cause by doing these types of things.  When there is real discrimination and injustice, nobody will take them seriously."
I'm not sure I see a pattern of racial discrimination in favor of black people in this country.  Do you have any studies that don't include cherry-picked items?
Start your own law firm and be as black as you want to be.
"OK, so algebra discriminates against black politicians, too."
Yes our republican president who is bringing back honor and class .  Isn't it great that we don't have that black guy as president embarrasing the country all the time?       lol
"Why are you so bothered by black wealth ? The way Afrikaners speak as if they do not give each other tenders perplexes me honestly. Why are you constantly scrutinising how black people attained their wealth. It must first be questioned, legitimised before it can be accepted by Afrikaners. Your assumption is always that it must have been stolen."
Is 1/3 black too much for you?
What do black slave# not have to do with this & only the word Black is capitalized. An error on Your part.
"My post was civil.  I think I must have asked too many sensible questions that someone didn't want other people to think about such as ""What were Black people doing when they were shot by police?"" and also something about numbers of Blacks shot by police vs Blacks shot by Blacks."
"What about the non violent folks stopped just because they are black or Native American on some silly made up excuse, there are plenty of videos online showing nonviolent folks getting beat or shot. There are very few repercussions for cops that do anything.
We have had AST personal shoot several people before much happened to them, one was the legless fellow at a pulloff, I think he was the second for that ""law enforcement "" person. Another was the second victim of a female AST, shoot a native in Delta that even the other cop there thought was uncalled for.
I think felons and perps of domestic violence should lose all guns, that way our cops will be safer on the next call, it's no wonder some are so scared. We do have plenty of good decent police why put them in danger?
Maybe black people run because they know the entire ""justice system"" is stacked against them and they don't want to be beat or killed like their friends have been."
"I don't know. I wouldn't support it because it is easy to imagine it as a kind of hate speech. It would be stupid though, because people would definitely let you know how they felt about such garb. More power to them, I say. 

But again, you make a false equivalency. How is a KKK hood and a freely chosen niqab the same? I can see why a black person would be harmed by a troop of KKK people on the subway. How are you harmed by a group of women with a niqab?"
"Of course, if you watch any one of numerous videos of police officers shooting unarmed blacks, you realize your point is baloney."
"why does black feel that the public needs to see the detailed negotiations of the chief's settlement?  the commission by law is the authority to deal with issues involving the chief, so let them so the work.  is black trying to subvert the law and allow public opinion to influence the work of the commission?  this is really stupid.  we are a nation of laws and they must be followed.   people have the right to voice their opinion but it is done so following the law.  if they do not like the work of the commission than they can voice their opinion, but the commission in following the law, does not need to change their decisions.  the chief has given the city over 30 years of honorable service.  everyone makes mistakes, so this mistake should not erase the good things he did, he earned his retirement.  in regards to the separation pay, since he was on a contract, it is normal that if the contract is terminated for any reason, cash payments are involved."
"And the best part is Obama and Bush carried out basically the same foreign policy of disastrous misadventures in the Middle East. Obama spent more and racked up more debt than all previous presidents combined. Race relations are worse than they were since the 1960's. His only legacy other than destruction of our influence and stature is a failed healthcare law which no one likes save a few true believers. All propped up by a dishonest and complicit media who can't criticize the first ""black"" president. These guys are still blaming Bush, who was also a nightmare."
"Excellent, another example of America's shame, using people, along with great slights to its indeginous people, Blacks, and Micronesians in its Imperial Aggression."
"I am not quite sure what you are trying to say.  But I think you are looking at it from the wrong end.  A business open to the public, Masterpiece Cakeshop, is refusing to provide a cake for a gay couple.  The business is not participating in a religious ceremony, nor is it practicing a religion.  (Businesses do not have religions.)  Since it is open to the public, it may no more discriminate against gays than a diner in the South could lawfully refuse to serve black people."
"your grandma is in a refugee camp outside aleppo, the sudan or yemen. no clothes, no food, no money, no documents. i think the community where the grandson, cousin or uncle lives should be allowed to vet and vouch for her. i also think diverdave and rangermc would let her rot, and die, in that camp, primarily because she is not a born again christian."
"But why doesn't he hire black south african attorney's (instead of kemp j kemp), in the spirit of radical economic transformation? lol"
and you are implying that no other lives matter except black ones.  How racist of you.
Ramaphosa is an utterly corrupt politician and he must quit office. There is no way that the South African people can accept a man who uses women for his pleasures.
"Aren't you embarrassed for having to resort to repeatedly censoring my posts to hide your proven untruths? I believe that your comments reveal a somewhat racist and colonial attitude to people of colour like me, who don't have your 'sense of content' or 'taste'."

"This editorial is ridiculous. The writer conflates Meryl Streep encouraging those upset over Trump's election to make art, with some ludicrous, non-existent declaration of war against Trump by the wildly diverse, completely heterogenous, multi-ethnic, multicultural, multi-polar arts world. 

But of course art is political. Does the writer think the poster of Obama and the word HOPE wasn't political? Was Guernica not political? Is John Corligiano's AIDS symphony not political? Or Hamilton, for Heaven's sake? 

The very idea that art should consist only of abstract concepts sterilized of meaning is on its face ludicrous. Just today in this paper we read two high-level South Korean government aides were arrested for compiling a blacklist of thousands of artists. Should the arts in the face of such an assault not respond? In the '30s Hollywood enforced exactly such a blacklist. 

The arts will do what they've always done. Speak truth to power, interpret the world & respond to issues of day"
"Wrong. Every vote in FL was NOT counted! That included tens of thousands of Black registered voters who were illegally kicked off polls, whose votes never went to anyone. Ultimately the overwhelmingly Catholic Supreme Court made the final call there. But go ahead...  keep blaming Nader. That chip on your shoulder will break your back one of these days."
"hey black, if there were any wrongdoing or a criminal act, steps would have been taken against the offender, but none was taken.  so, thinking clearly, there was nothing of any consequence.  making a mountain out of a molehill?"
"Are you sure that the ""black-clad punks"" (fascists) who caused so much damage were UCB students?"
"Lies and leftist propaganda.  The country was 
NOT founded on slavery.  A very small portion of the population were slaves that were sold to Arab slave traders for a few trinkets and used all over the world, not just here.  The Civil war was about territory and resources like many wars.  Slavery was a by-product of that war.  Slavery was invented in Africa. More slavery goes on around the world today than the miniscule numbers here 100's of years ago.  Why don't you come up with a new leftist issue?"
"Yet they didn't kick out the Native half of the act. The only difference was the black guy asked why? Put yourself in his shoes, what conclusions would you come to?"
For me your comment takes the cake. You were not disrespected! If you served the country we are proud of you and thank you for your service. Don't get your panties in a bunch. This protest is not about our military. It about how America(some folks who are Americans) treat and allow mistreatment of It's citizens namely police behavior towards black and brown men.
Honey?  Did you read the article?  She attacked Pope Francis for saying that countries should be welcoming of immigrants.  That is her whole platform.  That France would be better if she could kick out all the dark skinned people and Muslims.
"While Trump had that $1million head start to become a billionaire, how do you explain his selection for Secretary of the Army' a 2nd Generation Italian-American who graduated from West Point, did his military service and THEN became a billionaire?

How about Dr. Ben Carson the ( gasp!) black former Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  He has received more than 60 honorary doctorate degrees, dozens of national merit citations, and written over 100 neurosurgical publications. In 2008, he was bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.  (By President Obama, of course.)  Raised by a single mother in Detroit.  

Trump has selected him for his cabinet, too.  

Trump, the racist, also has an Orthodox Jewish son-in-law and his daughter converted to Judaism.

How does that fit into your pile of biases?"
"The news reports coming from Germany no longer say it is an act of terror.  The new Black is Red - wrong! - any news report that attempts to cover for Islamic fascism is providing cover for terror; using the ignorance of the people to deceive them...but, it won't last..."
"Young people were murdered by racists in the sixties while trying to make sure that black people could exercise their right to vote.

Yes, that was an upheaval.

Maybe you should familiarize yourself with history."
"im glad she talked to trump. if everyone did, maybe he would see the errors of some of his appointments and statements. a no fly zone, as envisioned by clinton, was an area in syria, agreed to by syria, russia and the u.s. where syrian civilians could flee to and not be bombed by anyone. i wonder is tusli noticed that trump didnt invite any ugly, black, hispanic, muslim, or any other, congresswomen to join the discussion."
"I don't see the relevance. A racist policy (remember the Komagata Maru incident, or the Chinese ban) was wrong, and in retrospect the Jews were sent back to their deaths.

The situation here is different. Most Haitians would simply go back to poverty, and lose their cushy North American lifestyle. Those who managed to squirrel away money while in the U.S. could enter Haiti with assets to allow them NOT to enter at the bottom of the economic ladder."
"Perhaps, but the important question is will the US ever be free of this malignant, nepotistic incompetent? She darkens any ray of hope like a blackout curtain, waiting to extinguish any and all forms of light like the sad, attention addicted cat lady she has become. She lost one nomination to an unknown, and a general election to an emospastic buffoon that admits to groping women and hating brown people? What possible use can there be in allowing her to suck any more precious oxygen from the already toxic atmosphere that is Dumberikkka? If she will not go on her own she should be put to pasture."
"Western nations are in the ME fighting all the assorted crazy  warlords of Taliban , Al Qaeda ISIS and so on so the they, the bad guys don't kill more  and more and more  innocent people. For all the thanks the west get , the killing goes on because the Muslim armies have no intention to live and let live. Every attempt by the west to negotiate peace creates worse war by all the factions of Islam."
"I haven't heard anyone else mention this, maybe I missed it: maybe the ""Hysterical Left"" (maybe that's my own term too) should be falling to their knees in thanks to President Trump? Because: Honestly do you think these ""Symbols of Hate"" would be coming down across the nation, under Hillary? Did they come down under Husband Bubba? Did they come down under Obama? No. Even under a black President, the statues stood tall. Donald Trump is a closet Genius. Or maybe forget the closet All Together."
I think it goes beyond that. It seems some folks so badly want to destroy our first black president's legacy that they don't care what the consequences are to themselves are anybody else. We are moving away from an anglo-centric America and these xenophobes are freaked.
"You missed the point, Martha, as did so many others, it's not a free country for many. The anthem and flag do not represent a free country. As a "" teacher"" how did you overlook this fact? I find it appalling that so many responders evidently are so ignorant or support the racism in America, the indiscriminate shooting of people of color, the police brutality against people of color."
"November 19 2015.  Chuck Schumer twitted:
https://twitter.com/SenSchumer/status/667408740858134528

""We must tighten loopholes in the Visa Waiver prgm, ensure passports can’t be faked & stop terrorists who want to exploit the system.

Trump's doing what Schumer said needed to be done 14 months ago.  So why's Schumer faking tears on natl TV?  One possibility is his act (and good grief, no intelligent person would consider otherwise considering the self humiliating, disingenuous, clown who can't be taken seriously that Schumer) is intended to convince the downtrodden slaves on the Democrat plantation to remain beholden to their masters, by making them think he's championing the cause of the downtrodden.

""Poor black people have been voting Democrat for 50 years.  They're still poor.""
Charles Barkley, a man among men."
"Well I know the answer for BLM, SJWs and LGBTs - that would be ZERO. For the 1 percenters it's many billions-  but they are all rightwingers (since conservative politicians sell laws they like to buy like deregulation), or do you mean the people who PROTESTED the 1-percenters at Occupy ? That is still Zero.
Then you have three more items on you list, and one of those are ALSO zero mostly because the insulting term has no meaning at all.

Nevermind. I've been saying for 2 years now that Trump's actions and words WILL lead to Nazi's killing people in the streets. Everybody told me I was being paranoid. Well - now a Nazi has killed somebody in the streets - and the alt-right web has not just been celebrating but blatantly stating their intention to kill many more. 
Nazis gave us one world war. The only reason they haven't given us another yet is because their chosen leader this time is utterly incompetent at everything. Small mercies I guess..."
"Comments sections are great for the same reason Trump is great: they shine a  light on the squalid little black heart of the self-styled ""conservative"" movement and display how vapid and morally and intellectually empty its true believers truly are. 

In this thread, observe the common rhetorical conservative ""tactic"" of 1) making a race-baiting comment; 2) when called out for said race-baiting comment, trying to turn the tables to say ""you're really the racist! You brought race into this!"" These people who do this are unable to help themselves; they were raised on a steady diet of resentment  and think poking fun at the physical characteristics and ancestry of other people is the height of wit. 

They know they're being left behind by a world that finds them as distasteful and ignorant as the people who threw rocks at little black girls getting off school buses in the 50s.  Unable to adjust, they resent those who did. So they vent here. The dogs bark but the caravans move on."
"I love Donald. Blacks will not get special treatment, they will be treated equally. Equality isn't always what they wanted. 
I would also tear into any elected official that claims the election is false. The mainstream media, at the expense of country's future, are trying to sow doubt about the results of the election because of their bigotry against Christians, farmers, and those that voted for Trump. I would spare no mercy in attacking these enemies of democracy if I were Trump as well. He owes them nothing."
"Pansies?! Seriously? Care to make comments about Jews and Blacks while you're at it?

While bigoted references like this would normally be removed, I think it's good for people to see how the right thinks."
"Sit. Stand. Be respectful or not. This isn't about free speech as you've suggested Mr. Dingman, but rather that of a disrespectful Prima Donna. I think the real story here is that Kaepernick actually thinks he lives in a ""....country that oppresses black people and people of color."" Nonsense. Please don't demean those that have actually sacrificed to ensure our rights, including your right to have this rubbish printed. Your favorite NFL team's QB has sacrificed nothing"
"Before Obama manufactured all this racism 70% of all American's said race relations were good, now it's less than 40%, what happened in those 8 years? The great divider created a class of Black Racists like Black Lives Mater to further his Marxist agenda is what happened."
"Hopefully, they mention the true history of the KKK here, the sundowner laws, and how we were the only state admitted into the union with racial disparaging language - specifically banning any ‘free negro, mulatto, not residing in this state at the time’ from living holding real estate and making any contracts within the state.”  But, I guess it always easiest to ignore those facts...
And, then there's the more recent Eugene history...murders, rapes, robberies, property crime, and graffiti...ah, but then again, it's easier to ignore those too..."
"i guess only certain, politically correct, politically motivated, aka fully USED by the left black lives matter"
"It does seem like that. I think it's completely sexist for people to see a woman as an extension of her father. I don't think most people are aware of this but Hillary Clinton's father was a vocal racist  - he openly called black people racial epithets, was abusive to her mother, etc. Yet I never see people holding Clinton responsible for his racist views."
You are right but you forgot to mention income inequality which is much worse in the US and BLM what reflects the genuine concern by black Americans but you are hard pressed to find similar cases in Canada.
"""black supremacist group""? Wow.  Please provide evidence because all I've ever heard from them is a demand for equality. I guess maybe to you, for black people to  have equality would actually mean a demotion for you."
"If only the poorly educated black folks who turned out for Barrack would have shown up for Hilary at the polls. I guess they couldn't be bothered. To busy killing each other in Chicago, L.A., New York all those highly educated liberal hot spots......."
"Black Riders is one of the follow up groups to the Black Panthers.  You know one of the black terrorist groups.   In others, yes they are like the night rider that you mention.   They are on the SPLC list of hate groups.  Surprising that they are there in that the SPLC normally only has problems with almost all conservative groups."
I find it astonishing the register guard made no mention of Hillary Clinton meeting with that racist organization called black lives matter. It's tough living in a one party state.  That's OK if I don't vote I don't get those pesky jury duty notice.
"""Orange skin"" is more of a minority than brown or black. How about some tolerance sista?"
"So native Hawaiians are doing as bad or better than black Americans. This is because native Hawaiians tend to be poorer than their non-native peers, and because living healthfully in Hawaii is expensive. Seems like there are two options if you can't make it work in a certain area: move, or get more money. Seeing as how most of the social welfare programs designed to benefit native Hawaiians are more of a hand-out than a hand-up, the second choice probably won't work very well. Maybe they should move out of state in order to get the higher quality of life they need."
"If I were black and wanted to feel safe, I'd move to Chicago."
"Yes, but Trump will have to live up to his promises of equal treatment, he must honor the treaty of 1866 with the black indians, and maintain his promises and plegedes to the african american community."
"Far more rampant than any form of racist police discrimination is the plague of fatherlessness in the black community. Children living with their married biological parents are the least likely to commit criminal acts. It has been widely reported for years now that the out-of-wedlock birth rate among American blacks is over 70 percent.  Yet, when it comes to this grave matter, Colin Kaepernick and his NFL ilk are virtually silent.  

Far more rampant that racist police discrimination is the proliferation of black on black violence over drug turf.  If you really want to stand against something, pick something that really matters and makes a difference, not what you've been told by your groupthink echo chamber is ""THE"" issue."
"Part 2: Choice words from the author: 5) ""The biggest and most stupefying [revelation] is the breadth, depth and force of anti-Indigenous sentiment in this country, as well as how hard Canada has tried to mask that, and the shame and frustration that this erasure worked on me""; 6) ""Indigenous and Black people in Canada, who are incarcerated and put into foster care at indefensible rates largely because the state can’t stop staring at them, determined to make them into something else or eliminate them""; and 7)  ""whether our lustful appetite for hydrocarbon corpses is worth a sweaty and uncontrollable world"".  Remarkable. In one article, the author manages to show her support for all of the core beliefs of the left-wing Canadian progressives.  More remarkable, she has enjoyed a life of health and prosperity, with only the occasional verbal slight, and yet has such anger and hatred toward the country which allowed her parents to immigrate and become citizens."
"In California, 40 lives lost along with 3,500+ buildings and Trump has nothing to say or tweet for a week. Oh, never mind; it's a blue state with a lot of black and brown people."
"The American voters already weighed in on Bill Clinton's womanizing and gave him one of the highest presidential percentages over any other president; even over Reagan's low percentage during his last term.  Why is that?  Because the American people loath Republican hypocrisy!  As much as wrong-wingers are wringing their hands and hoping that the same voters will give p___y grabbing tRump a free pass, bet me they won't.  Women, blacks and Hispanics will be the cleanup voters.  Dump tRump."
"What is multiculturalism, and why is it bad.  This country has had St Patrick's Day parades (the Irish), Columbus day parades (the Italians), Christmas and Easter (the Christians), Passover and Hanukkah (Jewish), Cinco de Mayo (Hispanic) for decades.  Isn't that celebrating multiculturalism.  And what is identity politics but groups with like interests, culture, race banding together to help advance themselves in America.  Being part of the civil rights movement you should recognize that the movement actually was identity politics - working to get blacks equal rights.  And because a group works for equal treatment under the law or celebrates their heritage does not mean that the reject their identity as Americans.  It means they are working for the American dream.  And Dean when you try to connect liberals with Marxists you are more guilty of identity politics than any group that is working for equal rights."
"“There is another class of coloured people who make a business of keeping the troubles, the wrongs, and the hardships of the Negro race before the public. Having learned that they are able to make a living out of their troubles, they have grown into the settled habit of advertising their wrongs — partly because they want sympathy and partly because it pays. Some of these people do not want the Negro to lose his grievances, because they do not want to lose their jobs.”

― Booker T. Washington"
"I have to agree with brother Orobator:  We will never recognize the full ministry of women until we first ""re-image God"" devoid of all the patriarchal mythos that has such a death grip upon the Catholic hierarchy and priesthood.  God must be envisioned as being MORE than male, more than imaged as solely a father-god figure.

Actually, I believe that a new image of God was revealed to the world on December 24, 1968 [Merry Christmas!] when astronaut William Anders captured the iconic image of ""Earthrise"" from orbit over the lunar horizon: ""The Blue Marble"" serenely floated resplendent in the star-studded black abyss of space.

All of humanity is captured [save the photographer] within the frame of this photo of Earth as seen from its Moon,.  It was in a sense our first group family photo of all humanity.  

What an inspired image of the fullness of God, Our Mother!  It should be honored in every Christian place of worship along side of the crucifix and Risen Christ."
"Would you like to talk about the treatment of Native Americans and black slaves by your ""deeply Christian men and women,"" both at the colonial stage and later on -- up to and including today?  

Didn't think so."
"Activist athletes? Are they protesting the fact that the majority of crimes committed in the USA are from Blacks and Hispanics? That the majority of the shootings committed are because of Black on Black crime? Instead of publicly disrespecting our flag and anthem, how about spending your time in the inner city getting kids out of gangs instead."
"Nah, this article read like some paternalistic coddling for black people. Isnt it preposterous to continually note racialistic prejudices towards the group of people who have no 'qualms' about that treatment, not only from Guptas, but other groupings as well?"
"I am just amazed at the number of people who do not agree with you. 

To them I ask, first, if you agree that racial issues are a big problem in the US, and second, if you were an black NFL player who had seen these struggles through their lives what would you do?"
"45% of college educated people voted for Trump
37% of those with postgraduate degrees voted for Trump

"Good cite Martha. This is exactly how the ""news"" media has been playing the unaware public.

GDP hit 3.0 last quarter. The Stock Market is at an all time high! Unemployment is lower. And, as far as the ""racist"" claim goes, Black employment is way up under Trump. Inflation has stayed low. Foreign countries may not like him, but they do respect him, because they know he will do as he says."
"Oh that is complete bs.....people do not care if the President is Black or a woman. We witnessed an outright anti-Trump frenzy by all media, talk shows mouth pieces, and celebrities......all the people who control the messages that are being sent to Americans.  It was so vile and obvious, it did not take much for people to see through the manipulation tactics being used by the Democrats, and the Liberals here in Canada.    This has become the left game plan, sell the celebrity President or PM, or go for the 'first Woman' for votes, always a catchy thing.   I think the every day people let the overblown, self important people  know they do not control free thought and who people vote for.....no matter how many free concerts and foaming at the mouth.  And thank goodness for it."
"If the G&M is reporting a watered down version of a UN report dealing with racism in Canada that describes African-Canadian racism as being so ingrained that it's considered 'normal',  why are Canadian athletes showing unity with the U.S. while ignoring the plight of the same group of people in their own country?

This article offers nothing new that the other 10 or 20 articles on the topic have highlighted. What would be newsworthy is not more of the same but given the conclusions of the UN's observations, why aren't Canadian athletes doing something similar to getting on one knee in their own country?  Why would they ignore the racism in their own country but support American athletes and blacks.

"""Many of the early settlers to Oregon were from Southern states and brought with them negative attitudes about blacks.""

Many early settlers were from the South, but many also were from the Northeast, and some of those had negative attitudes about blacks. That sentence just seemed like an unwarranted jab at the South"
really?  You think Black people are one homogeneous group that follow a particular person and want to be fearful angry and resentful?  Where do you make this stuff up from?
"Apartheid's architects did claim that Apartheid was 'for the benefit of black people'...and yet it clearly wasn't...similarly, though Communists may claim to be motivated by equality etc., Communism when put into practice has, without exception, resulted in millions of deaths and widespread misery...so, one might say there are parallels."
All of us demonstrate independent thinking.  My point is that the black conservatives I listed don't agree with the liberal narrative of what is racism and how much of it is there.
"""this area of growing violence against Republican....""   Seriously Paul? Got some stats.  While your at it look up growing violence against journalist and young black men by cops.  

This guy had mental illness.  It was not a Republican thing.  This guy like all shooters was just plain ill.  Here's a guy with multiple incident of violence in his history yet he can buy a gun just like you and me. That sir, is the fault of Republicans. We seem to wait til they have felony conviction before we take their gun away, when in reality misdeamenors such as assualt should also be scrutitinized.  This guy assaulted someone with the butt of a gun, yet those charges were dropped.  

Anyone can tell that Mcaulliff, including him, made a nerd error about 93 million and he recanted. Not unusual. He corrected himself and you did not mention that,  

Any one who is held convicted of a domestic assault, felony or not, looses their guns. Why wait til they are a felon, and more so with his guys history"
"The leaks that are happening should be the real concern. Whoever is doing it needs to be caught, charged and prosecuted. Leaking Intel to media borders on treason. 
Russia was one of our allies in the last world war. Russia became our ""enemy"" in the Cold War which allegedly ended with the fall of the Iron Curtain. 
However, the Joe McCartys of the House and Senate seem eager to see it going again. Seeing Russians everywhere. Will they start black listing writers and actors ? 
Will they send people to the electric chair like the Rosenbergs ? 
People who can't remember what that was like then should read up and study it because that is what it is starting to resemble. 
 If you are a Republican or voted for Trump, (you could be a Bernie supporter)  you must be a Russian sympathizer too, besides being a Nazi and a Facist.. 
And if you are a Russian sympathizer (or spy) does that mean you are a Communist or Socialist ?

"Yes, she is ""very tenured"" and has been a full Professor for some 35 years at the University of Oregon. She's right at the apex of the law school.
 As far as blackface and other racial stereotyping I hope now, with this incident, most people will understand it's not ""funny"" and is likely to upset other people even if not intended.  With the racial tensions at the university this year common sense would suggest you avoid it except in very special circumstances..

However, dressed as a ""commando"" I don't think anyone would accuse you of wearing  racist ""blackface"" as you were impersonating a standard military technique rather than an actual African-American.
This is in contrast to our Professor who, in her lawyerish apology admitted only to wearing ""black makeup"", not the socially explosive ""blackface"" others saw."
"This story, by a young, female, black doctor illustrates beautifully how such ""greatness"" of men perpetuates racism and misogyny.   The deeply seated, unconscious bias on the part of the flight attendant is precious.    When a passenger experiences a medical emergency, the attendant calls for assistance from a doctor on board.   The female, black doctor tried to help.  She was told: “Oh no, sweetie, put [your] hand down,” the flight attendant said, according to Cross. “We are looking for actual physicians or nurses or some type of medical personnel, we don’t have time to talk to you.”

"Delusional! You live in a world of men woman! You seem to forget, along with the ANC that there is no physical barrier between you, your principles, your dreams and your enemy. When people feel they are being oppressed and abused, they will stand up against such. Yes there might be backlash in the form of a counter strike, but that does not matter in the world of men (in which you are just a woman, unable to realistically do anything when masculine cultures clash). Please understand this, you and all the woman out there that think they understand how humanity works. You will as surely as I be a victim when cultures clash in SA. Viva from the ANC or not."
"And do you feel the same about blacks being gunned down, or is it just Finicum?  How about Michael Brown?"
"The reality is it's variable.  Bear spray did not help in the Pogo attack where it was deployed.  Guns present their own problems when defending another person.  With the bear on the mauling victims, they could be hit by a bullet unless the shooter has damned sure aim.  So spray was definitely the better thing here, but if it hadn't worked a gun would have been handy to have as a last resort.  

That's the problem.  Each attack is different and there's no one solution.  Grizzlies and black bears have differing behavioral patterns.  Some attacks are defensive, others predatory.  And each individual bear has its own quirks, just like all other animals.  What works for one can fail with another.  It's not predictable and it happens with horrific speed.  

People who insist that there is only one viable choice, be it guns or spray, are both proven wrong by the history of attacks.  There's more than a little logic to carrying both."
"I guess you don't raise livestock or have chickens/other birds.  ""Black"" guns (i.e. .223's with large magazines with ergonomic features proven through continuous use by the military) are great firearms for shooting the groups of wildlife that thinks farm animals are a wonderful food source.
""Black"" guns of other calibers are great for dangerous game like wild boar, and coincidently, effective for hunting larger game, too.

As for ""nut jobs"" inflicting their ""own brand of evil"", not having access to a firearm has been recently shown (and in the past) to not make much of an impact.  The most deadly school massacre was not done with a firearm, as well as the most deadly nightclub massacre."
"Ok, this has to stop! Why in a country that we are Free to believe what we want is this such a story? The President has stated his position and that should be the end of it. Whether we agree or disagree in this country people have the Freedom to believe what they choose, others may not like it but as long as no one is forcing thier beliefs upon you they have that Right. You can condemn the offensive beliefs but then let it go and rise above it and go on. I for one do not like these racist radicals nor do I like the Black lives Matter radicals, but my opinion is just that , My opinion. This tragedy could have been avoided if one of two things had happened, one- the permit to protest was not issued or two - the law enforcment divided the groups not ordered to stand down.

As a society the mistakes of the past are important reminders of who we are today."
You sound kinda racist against Africans and Asians (though curiously not against Latin Americans). Who cares where the priest is from as long as he's a solid Catholic?
"Somebody must call a spade a spade.  “When current black students feel unsafe to walk into Deady Hall...""  In view of all the positive life actions of Deady as enumerated above, I conclude that those students who feel unsafe walking into Deady Hall are mentally disturbed.  Or perhaps the students are just being disingenuous and misrepresenting their feelings to achieve a political objective.   I have little sympathy for those who attempt to manipulate us to achieve political objectives especially when they invoke notions of safety where there is no rational danger.  Can any rational human attribute danger to entry to Deady Hall that is related to the name of the building?"
"Ya it's a great image, but theres a big Irony. The Board of Game in there infinite  wisdom is  mandating state sponsored  455 black and grizzly bears being killed, in a two year period.2012- 2014 from helicopters and planes. not only that but there also alowing hunters and trappers in the long narrow stampede trail corridor that cuts deep into Denali National Park, to bait wolves and bears out of the park and kill them. This situation is an embarrassment to Alaskans."
"President Elect Trump alrready proved he is on the right road to healing the black inner city problems.  He got 15% of the black votes, the most ever given a Republican.   I know it's not the huge numbers the Democrats have but in terms of healing it's a  great beginning, the wonderful american black community are paying attention."
"And already the new roofs leak, the teacher's raise lags far behind the nat'l average, the mold is growing, etc, yeah, we know it all by heart. Get ready for another levy. The monster devours all, yet still our kids are outscored by Botswana. Pfhooie. Are you still teaching them that cops are cruising about looking for black people to shoot? Rise up, people, and rid ourselves of Hillary's Henchmen in Sequim."
"Someone doesn't keep up with domestic terrorism.
Covenant Sword, and Arm of the Lord, KKK, Animal Liberation Front, Alpha 66, Aryan Nation, Army of God, Black Liberation Army, Earth Liberation Front, The Order, the Jewish Defense League. Nevermind the Timothy McVeighs, Terry Nichols, Eric Rudolphs, Theodore Kaczynskis, and Robert Dears.

If you believe that 99% of terrorists are Muslim, you're just not bothering to look (or ignoring) plenty of domestic actors that aren't Muslim. Don't be fooled, every religion, race, and creed has their violent extremists."
"I remember his comment, something to the effect of ""I will never hold the door for another black person, I have no respect for any of them."" Sometimes Richard, your words can come back to haunt you, not that you give a hoot."
"We do have a lot of refugees, but certainly the climate is the least cause. According to NASA the Sahel is getting greener. 
Greenhouse gardeners say that the raised CO2 levels make plants grow better and there is generally more moisture in the air.  Political strife wars and extremism caused to a great extent by uncontrolled population growth are the major reasons. And then of course some people, who are not even all that bad off,  are just fed up with uncertainty and life in poor smelly and dirty countries and want to live in any of the rich countries where they promise themselves effortless wealth. 

I know that the climate is changing, after all it always has been changing, and I am convinced that man is in part responsible for it, but these catastrophic prediction by self proclaimed climate scientists are often just too ridiculous for words. 
The other day I read about 2.5 meter sea level rise by the turn of the century - about 30 centimeter per decade - what a lot of codswallop."
"Even Supreme Court justice Scalia said that allowing religion to trump non-discrimination laws would set a bad precedent. People would then be a law unto themselves, being able to decide which laws they did and didn’t want to follow. Chaos would ensue.
Fifty years ago, racists were forced by law to serve black customers when the Civil Rights Act was passed. The government can definitely *force* citizens to serve other citizens they personally don’t approve of when it benefits society as a whole."
"I see no difference between refusing to serve gay people today and refusing to serve African Americans at the lunch counters of the deep south during the civil rights movement. Discrimination is discrimination. Period. When you run a public business and agree to serve the public you cannot discriminate against protected classes of people. That is the law. If you don't think you can offer a specific service to all patrons without discriminating, then don't offer that service. No harm, no foul. Do we want the country we proudly call ""the land of the free"" to regress to the point where the sign in the window singles out the people they don't serve? I certainly don't think so."
"The article brings to mind the Spreuer Bridge and Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge) in Luzern, Switzerland.
(The latter was severely damaged by fire in 1993 but since restored).
On the Kapellbrücke there is a panel featuring Death, which says (in Latin): ""What you are now, I once was; What I am now, you will be"".
You only have to consider the Black Death to understand the obsession with death in the Mediaeval Period."
"So, is Breitbart's prominently displaying a story on the recent UNICEF report showing a surging use of children as suicide bombers by Boko Haram make them racist? Or are WaPo and the NYT, both essentially burying the story on their websites, in their usual, ""nothing to see here"" coverage of Islamic murder, terror, and hatred the real racists, since they have calculated that it's more important to be apologists for Islam as opposed to reporting on the slaughter of innocent black lives? 
You don't know what you're talking about."
I'd like to see some data as to black American support for William Sessions.  Or did you just make it up?  No one in my rather large extended family has given any such indication.
"Your 'long.time' professor should of known better.  I appreciate the fact that Mr. Coleman, an African American has given his opinion on this issue.  

I'm pleased this caused him no never mind.  He is, however, not the only human being living in Eugene Oregon that is of color and has an opinion on this situation.  He is one man.  Let's ask all the hundreds of our Eugenians that are also of the African American race........oh wait: there aren't that many.  Huh.  Strange.

Wonder why?  If this 'enlightened' professor wants to do something..daring or off mainstream?  Let her fix her costume to reflect a woman who has been beaten or has had a mastectomy or hey!  how about dressing up for a party in rags and call yourself a homeless person.  Not too darn funny and many others agree.

Yeah.  So funny.  hahaha.  This prof is HISTORY!!!"
"""The Democratic party is an institution...""

Indeed it is, a MENTAL institution.  Black privilege and political correctness for the last eight years has divided America bigly and added $10,000,000,000,000 to our national debt.  Young taxpayers of all colors will not soon forget that when it comes time to pay it down."
"Let's go through some of Cal's points:

""A liberal is a liberal, regardless of gender, race or ethnicity.""  If you think Hillary is a liberal, just go ask a Bernie supporter.

""When it comes to accomplished conservative female leaders...Ronald Reagan's consequential U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.""  
But not so long ago Cal said this about the UN:  ""The United Nations is a monument to man's misinterpretation of man. It is a humanist shrine to man's impossible goal of living at peace with one another.""  Consequential?  How?

""Otherwise, they would have applauded the advancement of African-Americans like Gen. Colin Powell, Justice Clarence Thomas... and conservative women like Sarah Palin""
I wonder how Powell feels about Trump?
Clarence Thomas - we should applaud L. D. Silver?
Sarah Palin - sigh...

""The left gets away with these kinds of smears because they largely control the media and the message.""
Yet here he is published in the ADN, and a regular Fox contributor to boot."
You have no idea? She used the N-word to publicly refer to a black woman who complained about racial abuse at the school board .  She also  verbally attacked an oriental trustee on the board for not having English as her mother tongue. But this is all manna from heaven for racists who like to post in the Globe and Mail. The racists will never win because the majority of Canadians will make sure that never happens.
"Obama tried to help minorities by promoting educational opportunities, early childhood care, anti-poverty supplements, etc. whose recipients were a higher percentage of black people. It was the only type of unadvertised help the Republican Congressmen could agree to and not damage their re-election chances."
"I cannot believe THIS got censored by the CivilGestapo! Dana Morris:  This must be your first day posting on ADN.  The leftist posters on ADN have labeled me a homophobe because I think that fully grown men sharing women's restrooms with little girls is not a good idea.  The leftist posters on ADN have labeled me a bigot because I think increasing immigration 550% from countries that wish to destroy the U.S.A. is not a good idea.  The leftist posters on ADN have labeled me a racist because I think ""black lives matter"" is not a good idea.  I cannot believe THIS got censored by the CivilGestapo!  The hidden agenda in here is not exactly ""hidden"" is it?"
"Hmmm doesn't the ""nothing about us, without us"" allow the previous era of segregation.?  Don't include and therefore don't even need to acknowledge existence of, doesn't seem to be a great way to integrate populations. Since treating one group as marginal and second class (for example aboriginals in Canada, blacks in US) created so many of the current and historical injustices, why are so many marginalized groups now pushing to have that divide reinforced?  I suppose it might make sense if their culture now had the upper hand and wanted a tit for tat revenge however it doesn't seem to me that they do have the upper hand and that these increased divisions can only hurt the more marginalized in their communities even more than they are now."
"Just one of the host of General officers now running the nation's privatized military with unlimited funding, highly paid in salary and benefits, but the same greed merchants found throughout the ruling Corporate Oligarchy.  All willing to sell their souls and the nation to anyone with the right price.  All provided free government education at West Point just like Rep. Eastman filled with fundamentalist christianity, racism, bigotry, and Republican traitorous ideology.  None of them ever paying for the failed strategies in operations resulting in death and disablement of troops and ""war"" failings.  The worst they get for traitorous acts is retirement with golden parachute pensions, government jobs, and/or Corporate Financial positions.  The rot contained within the entire government has reached the point where only revolution will remove the black stains created by the massive deregulation and loss of civilian moral control of the nation.  Time for a Revolution."
"Two close friends in MN, have been attacked, one stomped in the ground by a moose, smashing her legs, she lived, no gun, no spray. Dumb, as she was warned many times. The other was mauled in her own home by a black bear. Momma bear and cubs were being fed down the lake most of the summer... when momma got agressive and attacked the knuckleheads that were feeding her, they stopped. And never advised any neighbors about the bears. Later that week after many people were charged by momma, the three made thier way into the garage where blackoil sunflower seeds and fish remains were left, when my friend opened the service door into the garage, bam, momma attacked, both fell back into house, cubs went up a tree. Luckily she was on the phone when the bear attacked. Otherwise she would be dead. The attack lasted 7-8 minutes in a small room, 10X10ft, the walls and carpet were red. It took us a good ten minutes to get there, as we arrived the female bear ran out of the house covered in blood."
"Indeed, those of us who supported President Obama had the rather naive idea that electing a President who shared our political/economic/social values AND who happened to be an AfricanAmerican just might help end the ""racial divide"" which has been present in the US since pre-colonial days.  Boy, were we ever wrong.  Instead, his election brought forth a tidal wave of racist rants...millions of internet posts....from individuals who saw the election of a Black President as ""license"" to share their racial hatred.  

Are we more racially divided than before President Obama's election....yes, I fear we are.

Is it his fault?  YES, it is...It's his fault for thinking (and our fault for supporting) the ideal that someone can actually be BLACK and be PRESIDENT.......It's our fault for underestimating the level of racial hatred which still exists among many Americans.  If you condemn my statements as hyperbole, try Googling ""racist rants against President Obama"""
"Good point ""Robert plourde"" that ""only one shyster went to jail"" for the destruction of millions of people's lives and yet when one black man wants to sell individual cigarettes on the streets of New York (against municipal regulations, you see) he is tackled to the ground and killed by three police officers.  And they wonder why people are angry?"
"Are we suppose to feel sorry for a fraudster? That's what she was and that's what she is. It's just like if someone portrayed themselves as Hawaiian or Native American to get benefits. That's exactly what she did and is still trying to do. She could have picked any other name to change to, but she chose an African name. Just keep living the lie."
"I really don't get why this article is trashing on the Gates Foundation for providing women with contraceptives.  Apparently, African women want to plan their pregnancies just like American women.  Most women don't want to be constantly pregnant because it isn't pleasant.  Africa is still very misogynist and women don't have the right to refuse their husbands' sex so how else would a woman plan her pregnancies other than through birth control.  As long as it isn't coerced or forced, I don't see the issue."
"Ayers was responsible in the 60's but got a judicial reprieve due to illicit evidence by Hoover's FBI. H ehtn continued his radical ways  as a college professor.That degree of police attacks continued  with other radicals like the incident case and yes I resent those killers from the 60's and those now and sir I don't recall you getting any 3:00am dispatches to go to shots fired  and make the contact and arrest yet another criminal intent on killing civilians like you and the responding police. 

The attacks on the criminal justice system and police comes from the top  but fortunately he will be gone in a few short weeks. But with over 1,000 pardons and sentence commutations of black drug dealers he can still inflict more damage as he has for 8 years."
"Mahalo Barry! Thank you for putting Hawaii on da Map.
If Barry had a son, he'd be Dentric

Gov. Ige welcomes all to Hawaii with open arms, ISIS, Taliban, MS13, gangstas, Kim Un and Harvey, Loui, Bill(the gang of 3 sex predators), BLM, Antifa, etc.
No sked coming to the Land of Aloha, Hawaii won't Ask, so don't  you tell."
"You mean facts?  

That show that the black lives do not matter to the blacks that are killing them?  Those statistics?  

Well, they do matter to the killers because the black victims are interfering with the killers' businesses of drugs, protection and prostitution.  They also kill the Hispanics who try and muscle in on their territory.  

It's mostly just business.    

Reality sucks!"
"Maybe if the “voiceless”, as you so euphemistically refer to them, weren’t so busy robbing, assaulting, and murdering other “voiceless” people, their interactions with the police would be more pleasant.  This whole inane protest is based upon a foundation of lies, beginning with Mr. “hands up, don’t shoot” himself, Michael Brown.

While I have no doubt that the players do not think of it in this way, they are essentially protesting for the right of violent criminals to resist and/or assault police officers without consequence.  Nearly every recent example that has undergirded the “Black Lives Matter” agenda has involved a completely justifiable police shooting.  In only one example that I can think of, the one involving the man on the street in New York City who was suffocated, was there any reasonable question about the actions of the officers involved.  Also frequently ignored is the fact that in some of these cases the “evil” officers were themselves black."
And today more black Americans will murder their fellow citizens than were killed in Montreal.  So what 's your point- violence and murder are not entirely owned by by Muslims.  So we don't need you faulty analysis.

"I am sure that those same law professors and Masuma Khan herself would be equally quick to defend the same statement made in reference to Muslims, black or aboriginals on the grounds of free speech.  Excuse me while I roll on the ground laughing."
Has Stevie mentioned praying for Blacks to stop shooting other Blacks yet?
Black lives matter?  Antifa?
Maybe you should leave Black people to sort that out among themselves. You don't get to use the word.
"The black community complains of discrimination, so chooses to engage in discrimination itself. Nice."
"Why do racists always bring up ""black on black"" crime to excuse black people being killed by police?"
".... normally assigned to blacks, as the article at the link I posted describes, and therefore racist."
"There is an enormous amount of black on black street violence. The black community wants respect from outsiders, but they don't even respect each other."
Why don't the Catholics move to Africa and the blacks move to Northen Ireland?  Then maybe we'd finally have a lasting peace.
"So, you are calling all of the blacks who support Trump racists.  You need to become better informed before making such an insulting statement."
"@JP.....I hoping that you misspoke when you posted a comment regarding The Mims property, which is one of  the oldest black owned properties in Eugene.  You said ""A time when a class of citizens were discriminated against simply due to an accident at birth"". Being born black.....in my opinion, is not an accident at birth."
I'm guessing there were at least some number of players who didn't like or didn't agree with Obama. Did the team make sure those players got to show their unity? Its amazing after electing a black president twice and having black attorney generals for 8 years this country has more racial division than ever. So who's fault is that? Kap took a knee during Obama. What was Obama's response? The statistics don't lie - blacks kill blacks. Blacks kill police officers. Six police officers were shot in 3 different cities in August. What was the players response to that? The message is bogus - there are more successful blacks in this country than any other time. Check out Heather MacDonalds piece on nypost.com. Those are the real facts and the players are only serving to distract from them and the problems left by the Obummer presidency. You had the presidents full attention last weekend and instead of going to the table to discuss your protest you flip him the bird. Frauds!
"There was a time when Jews, Irish, Blacks and many others ""could not get public space anywhere"", ""were pushed to the fringe"", ""hounded by police and scorned by the mainstream"". 

Do you object to ""reversing"" that as well? 

Or do you simply want to get to decide who should be heard, and who shouldn't?"
"That was AFTER the Dallas shootings. Before the Dallas shootings, Obama was all about trying to excuse the violence in Baltimore and Ferguson. The executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations said this about Obama's wishy-washy rhetoric before the murders, ""It's a war on cops, and the Obama administration is the Neville Chamberlain of this war."" Did Obama condemn committed black nationalists? Nope. He blamed ""powerful weapons"". And that pillar of integrity Loretta Lynch doubled down, praising BLM and calling for more gun control and bringing up several shootings of blacks by cops. This comment will likely be ""rejected"" as my other perfectly civil comments criticizing Mr. Obama were, but it is the truth. Trump could have been stronger but the cherry picking is very hypocritical."

And this continues despite the 'autopsy' the party big wigs held years back that concluded the Republican'ts must have a 'bigger tent.'  So much for that. 

How shameful that Murkowski, Sullivan and Young are all in for Trump. That is proof positive that they don't listen to the people they are supposed to represent, and put party over all else.  They'll own that for years and years. Pathetic."
"In November 2015, Trump condoned the beating of a Black Lives Matter Protester at his Alabama rally stating that is was “justified.” 

When other supporters beat up a homeless Hispanic man, his response was that they were “passionate.” 

He told supporters at rallies to “knock the crap out of them,” and then offered to pay their legal fees"
"Geraldine, your feeble mind has failed you. Publicity for gay rights? Is that what MLK was doing with his marches, publicizing black rights? How about Fourth of July parades? It's terrible when people draw attention to themselves and their causes. Religious rights? This cake baker is advertising his cause. He is the one pushing the issue. What about the rights of someone who wants to not serve or hire blacks, Hispanics, women, Indians, Muslims, etc? What about the rights of someone who wants to enslave another?"
"And don't forget Mr. Smirk himself, Dick Cheney, the evil genius behind the whole Iraq War-ISIS disaster, the war crimes, the torture.
Was Cheney also a racist, xenophobe, homophobe, sexist? Is the Pope Catholic? 9/11 and the Iraq War disaster conveniently hid most of the social issues that Trump is exploiting. But Cheney was/is one wicked piece of work.
And don't forget: somewhere between 40-60% of Canadians supported the Iraq War."

"Blacks are always suspect and can be shot on sight by police for mere suspicion of being armed. This happens in even open carry states. It happens hundreds of times a year nation wide. Many criminals get their guns by way of gun shows in red states, sometimes using ""straw"" purchasers. The NRA has helped facilitate these sales by fighting every gun control law. For example, most guns in Chicago are bought in Indiana where the gun laws are much more lax than in Chicago. BTW, The NRA even fights research into why we have so many gun deaths. The police live in  fear because they know there are enough guns in the population for every man, woman, and child."
"Canadians are about to lose their Right to Free Speech as parliament gets set to vote for,  Liberal MP Iqra Khalid’s M-103 bill!

"Ntate Modiri, you could have said it in two paragraphs rather than go around with fancy language and quotes. You start by pretending that you are anti-corruption. Then you zoom in on those who are fighting state capture and accuse them of being anti-intellectual: that is a strong weapon to stop people in their track, because people naturally do not want to look and sound like idiots. But basically you are attacking those fighting state capture because you believe they are not doing it the intellectual way. The reality is that colonialism happened and apartheid happened. I can regale you with all the painful memories of living under apartheid but that will not change my life or the lives of many South Africans as it is now.  All I can do is to ensure that the current and future generations to not pay the price of corruption perpetrated under my watch. That is why I will support every initiative to stop state capture and ensure that the looters are behind bars where they belong."
"Interesting - I think those were the exact same excuses generals used in the past to keep blacks, women, and gays out of the military as well."
"I have seen more bad constitutional law than conspiracy theory from the left, especially on impeachment. There have always been conspiracy theory on the left, mostly among Greens. Some of the misinformation is deliberate, like the meme that abortion rights are in danger. Of course, the right wing likes to believe than can be, even whe they are not. Of course, much of the conspiracy theory around capitalism turning to oligarchy is true. As for the article, it relies on an unpublished study and a survey provider most people have never heard of. Ironic.

This shows that Long deserved his sheepskin from UVA. Good for him!

Silk nails him for how we all know what he is thinking. Of course, the point is that it will take him time to step away from his base, like it took time for Obama to support gay marriage even though the black church hated the idea. The thought bubbles raise the question of whether he is using Banon or just thinks like him. Only time will tell."
"More unsupported facts in support of a formulaic cut and paste attack.

"I'm certain if she were to inquire directly to the liberal, African American, lesbian officer who helped stop this shooter, she'd be corrected in her assessment about liberals and their ability to shoot.

"Sorry you fabricate a connection, Lazeelink (well named, by the way).

Murderers are indeed murderers, and hate crimes are hate crimes.  There are thousands of murders across the US every day.  There is no reasonable expectation that murderers are there to protect all citizens.

Sadly, for many Black Americans, there is also no reasonable expectation that the police in their jurisdiction are there to protect all citizens.  Last I looked, that's worth protesting, because elected government bodies might, if they gave a hoot, do something to fix that (since it is their responsibility).

Unless there is a remarkable sea change in US gun ownerships, there is precious little point in having protests against murders.  There might be a point in protesting unequal treatment of citizens by police officers.

So, yeah, you're engaging in whataboutism."
"Do you realize over 200 million American gun owners last night hurt no one with their guns ?  No gun law is going to stop nut jobs from getting guns .  How on earth do you think it will ?  Then , what if someone passed 20 background checks and passed every one of them with flying colors  . Does that mean with 100 percent certainty that something might never happen in their life where they go crazy ?  This is what democrats do after every tragedy--they offer a knee jerk reaction that will do nothing to stop these mass murders . look no farther than Chicago with it's nation leading strict gun laws . Every single week blacks slaughter other blacks , year in , year out---by the hundreds  .  Why doesn't Obama , Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson , Black Lives Matters or the national media care about those shootings and deaths given all the innocent people killed in the crossfire ?  And , how would even more gun control stop them ?  Then there's the kid who took his mom's guns . No law stopped that"

"Enough of the antifa and black lives matter biggots. Trump was never a racist. Police need to be involved because they are""first contact"" with street criminal activity. When you find out that the person is XYZ this needs to be passed onto other justice divisions.

"Pardon my refusal to accept your authoritarian method of declaring victory.  This is a discussion, not a sports game with ever changing rules.
You made an interesting assertion here; you equate people whose ancestors were enslaved and have been subject to extensive discrimination by government to people who are participating in an activity.  Even if a person is homosexual, they are demonstrating that by conducting an activity in private.  They are not the equivalent to someone born with black skin and this continuing effort to equate the two is not reasonable.  I defend the right of people to engage in freedom of association, including same-sex marriage, if they choose to do so.  Note there is no requirement for such people to be homosexual; people can choose to marry for whatever reason they choose, including to provide benefits for each other if they want.  After 10 years, a person is entitled to Social Security survivor's benefits, a significant benefit."
"You assert that ""prior to 1967, many states (maybe most of them?) required that persons who wished to marry be of the same race. The racism of the miscegenation laws is no longer 'respectable'.""  You seem to think it follows that ""the bigotry which heretofore prevented gay persons from exercising the civil right to marriage enjoyed by other citizens is now recognized, in law and by most people, as no more 'respectable' than the racism of the laws that prohibited interracial marriage.""  That's a hoot.  Maybe you can spell out how simply being black, which is no basis for discrimination -- and prohibited by the 14th Amendment --- is like committing acts which have long been viewed as a crime against nature.   Maybe you can explain how the Loving v. Virginia case, which of course involved heterosexual marriage, said ANYTHING about the legitimacy of marriage between two homosexuals."

Not much has changed."
In history more black people were enslaved by other black people.  I thought you were more informed.
"San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States.
.
His latest refusal to stand for the anthem -- he has done this in at least one other preseason game -- came before the 49ers' preseason loss to Green Bay at Levi's Stadium on Friday night.
.
""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game.

"Just to clarify, the petition is not calling for his firing from the university. It is asking that he not be a senior fellow at Massey College, which is not an academic position. He is not employed by Massey College.  Also, if the title 'Master' used at a table where black people are sitting would trigger the 'same ironic thought' in most people,  then it's time for a title change, no? Many universities have disbanded the use of the term, including Harvard. https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2015/12/qa-on-changing-house-master-title/"
"Same is happening in Europe: Asians are being attacked by blacks and North Africans because they resent the success of Asians in Europe. Unlike those other communities, most Asians have just gotten down to work, either starting successful businesses or excelling in higher education and entering the professions."
"If you were truly a black american, then you would know that the democrats of the 1700's and 1800's are  not the democrats of today.  The democratic party's platform changed in the 1960's."
"I agree with you 100%, Pamela, although they'll all try to conflate their hatred of felines with rationalizations.  Some will even say they have cats (inside  only, of course) the same way a racist will proudly point to their one black friend."
"They should also change Deady Hall. He supported slavery and black exclusion. Georgetown did, now Oregon needs to clean their slate too!"
"The NFL is predominantly black.  Hardly a sign of systemic racism.

The NFL loves a winner.  Teams will tolerate mavericks, but only as long as they win.  Otherwise, they are an unwelcome distraction.  Kaepernick WAS a winner, at one time, and then he wasn't anymore.    That's why he's still unemployed."
"Well said Gary.
Along with this, I'd add  that  with all the talk there are two issues that haven't been well addressed, IMO:

The students: You may recall that when the story broke and people were screaming pro and con, I suggested folks wait until the study is released to make their judgements--and I specifically asked two questions:  If any minority  students were invited, how did they feel? And if any law  students or junior faculty were there, would they have felt comfortable voicing their concerns at the party?
What we now know is that the party was a virtual extension of her classes, and that those who were upset didn't feel comfortable telling her their concerns.  With privacy issues, the report only mentions she called the two minority students to apologize the next day.

African-Americans.: As this issue has been about how blacks  supposedly  feel, how about asking the NAACP to hold a  representative panel discussion on ""How it feels to be black in Eugene.""

"I read the article in the NY Post that you reference. It doesn't even come close to proving or even justifying your claim that "". . . Obama supported the murders of cops . . ."" The article calls into question the language Obama used in criticizing instances of some police responses in black communities and when arresting blacks, saying in some instances ""racism"" may be involved, and that language like that from the president may inflame or may be used as justification by some people to shoot police officers. 
In my mind, whether or not I agree with it, that's a fair point to bring up. We all need to be careful of the words we use when discussing highly charges issues. But that is a far, far cry from what you said in your statement that "". . . Obama supported the murders of cops."" It's a lie, sir. Pure and simple. You know it. I know it. And anyone who objectively reads the article knows it.
What your motive is in making such an ignorant, prejudicial statement, only you and God know."
"So this has now gone from words to the ""tone of his voice"". How many different way is this going to be spun. If there is any apology it should be from  Rep. Frederica Wilson, D-Fla. who used the death of a black soldier for some political cause. What exactly is ""the tone of his voice"", was Trump laughing, mad, demanding what? We know Gen Kelly was in the room so he also heard ""the tone of his voice"". In a situation where condolences are being offered, who pay attention to the tone of the voices of those offering condolences? Unless of course there is some political aspect behind all this. This is getting to as shameful as Harvey Weinstein regarding race. A story yesterday implied Hollywood is racist, because NO black actress were among the women coming out against Weinstein."
"Another choreographed PR stunt by the Trump administration. Pence knew players would be protesting racial inequality and police violence. The whole thing was planned knowing that. Better to keep up the attacks on black athletes, than do something about Puerto Rico's devastation or the many, many other problems facing our country."
"Not surprising in the least.  After all, a radical Black Nationalist as president?  Who would have thought?  Now, the chickens really are coming home to roost, remember Rev. Wright and Barry Sorrento perched in sordid church pew for 20 years, and Michelle chanting, Amen, Brother!"
"A lot of false promises made by both parties, that's for sure.    i think Bill Clinton was/is well liked, not because of his official status, but because he simply likedI being around black people.   It's not always about money.    Not all black want or need assistance, but all would like basic human respect.   The Clinton and Obama's have both moved comfortably around black Americans of all incomes.

Generational poverty is really tough to break for anybody, racial bias just adds to the already tough position of a child born to poverty."
Black Souls Matter!
"It's sad that Hadiya's dad told her that the old lady on the subway didn't like her because she is black. That might have been true, but it would have been more accurate to say that some people don't like others because they look different. No one is immune to discrimination based on appearance, e.g. racism, which arrises from ignorance and fear. Unfortunately people from visible minority groups are much more likely to experience racial discrimination, by pure statistics. Everyone should be aware of this."
"Well JPZ, if you are that paranoid about losing your free handouts, get  a job an rely on yourself. I am thankful that Hillary was stopped from selling our country to the highest bidder, you should stay on topic. My recipe is boil the turkey bones, pick the remaining meat off the bones, add macaroni elbows to the strained broth, and black pepper. Add well chopped whole canned tomatoes (blender whole tomatoes taste better ). Oh and guess why the democrats are losing ground for years now,"
"I agree that fitting in is key. It is not just about merit. That being said…true story…picture a Senor HR executive with a major Bay Street Bank telling a group of black employees that the reasons why there are no black employees in the management pipeline is that there are no black MBAs at the bank. Also, picture the faces and absolute disappointment and horror of the black MBAs that were around the table with her. The point is, there is not always an opportunity to move beyond merit to then fit in. How would the black MBAs in this firm get a chance to prove to executives that they fit in if HR (HR!) did not know they exist. Career Advancement  101? It would be great if the opportunity was always there to exercise Career Advancement principles. There are so many other examples that I could cite, however at the end of the day, I am guiding my children to be entrepreneur as I do not want them to have the same unfortunate experiences that so many of us have had in Corp Canada."
"No and now you decide to interpret my stand in the past & the Holy Spirit's.  The church has changed doctrines in the past because they were wrong.  Like now the church can't own black people as slaves.   But we allowed this a mere 200 years ago.  

To say that owning black people as slaves is wrong now but not in the past is a lie and a very harmful one.

Abuse & the stripping of rights, whether civil or sacred, is always wrong.  Sin can not become righteousness over time, and Righteousness never becomes sin.  So either it was always wrong, harmful, and sin to allow the church to buy and sell black people, and either it was always wrong to strip women of their sacred right to same sacraments based on their flesh, or it never was & isn't now.   

The church needs to repent of the sin of sexism, even though that is uncomfortable.  The psyche of our women has been too damaged by this false belief of unworthiness of female flesh to just change and not repent - only truth heals."
"You answered your own question.  By framing the story around his race people, as demonstrated by yourself, will concentrate only on race and ignore all of the other circumstances of the story.  As if this story is somehow more tragic because he was a black guy.  Nowhere did I ever say that racism never existed in this country.  Stop putting words in peoples mouths and taking things out of context in order to distract the issue.  Racism surely is a part of this country's history and will continue to be a part of it until people like you stop making race the crux of every argument or issue.  I think your job this morning should be to tell us why you want to be part of the problem and not part of a solution."
"There was an interesting article about a decade ago, in Vietnam Magazine, that dispels that whole black soldier thing.  Actually government statics show that their percentage of the in country force and their casualty rate was close to equal to their percentage of the U.S. population of african americans."
"""it will be on you to prove one way or another for it to holdup in court.""

That's what the gay couple did, and they won against the baker. So...yeah.  If you see a business only providing service to people who are not visible minorities, but point to their precious little sign when a person of color walks in, it's pretty easy to prove."
"So what distresses you the most, unemployment half what he inherited, deficit increase 1/3, the withdrawal of US troops from two hugely expensive unwinable civil wars in the Mideast, the repair of ally relationships from our disaster ours war on terror (especially the disaster ours Iraq War), or the fact we have a black man as president? Above all the guy has class, something totally lacking in a certain GOP candidate right now."
Why has no report or comment I've read so far mention that McDade was black? (Mixed race)
"{cont.} ... were beginning to see that their ""natural"" economic interests actually lay with the Republican Party, and the implication was clear that he (Atwater) was looking forward to making inroads into the black voter base on precisely these grounds.  Odd thing for an inveterate racist to say.

Anyway, it appears to me that a very elaborate, political ""Just So"" story has been built up around a few small phrases taken entirely out of context, while the real substance of the interview has been largely ignored.  (And if you find these phrases highly offensive and inexcusable, well, take a look a few Richard Pryor album covers from the same period of time, or watch the movie ""Blazing Saddles"" {produced by that famous Republican racist, Mel Brooks.  Oh, wait!})  :-/

Lastly, D6's Wikipedia link to the RR speech with the supposed dog-whistles also provides some valuable historical context  - I recommend it.

If you've gotten this far in my long-winded reply, thanks for your patience.  ;-)"
"And how is kneeling by football players going to help? Why is car insurance more expensive for young male drivers, the young female drivers? Why is it that the police are more attentive to a group of young males? Because it's you males, regardless of race, that are more like to cause a problem. It's simply guilt by association. And any older male as experienced it. Is it fair no, but live's not fair. And the same hold true for blacks, guilt by association. And what are these players during, to help young blacks, grow up without being dependent of guns, gangs, or the government?"
"As has already been suggested, everything has been flipped around backwards. The comment is actually a criticism of Master Segal. This perhaps explains his attitude in this case because he doesn't like being referred to as a slave driver or whatever. The Black student was not the target of the comment. I see no racism here at all. Only clumsiness."
"I was referring to the actual event in which the doors of the black cadets were defaced.  I would have thought that the campus had cameras.  As for the deed, how do you know which student(s) committed the act?  We don't.  The General is assuming that black students were not involved which makes no sense."
"According to the Denver Post 51% of the city population is Latino, an 12% is black. So this past weekend I went to the Buskerfest at Union Station and the river festival at Confluence Park. In the journey I saw many new buildings and many people but no black or latino people. It felt weird to me, this must be what gentrification is in Denver."
Or other black males.
"If your logic prevails, he'd have to add black Americans or Africa to the list of people and countries subject to his travel ban as it was a disgruntled African-American that admitted to and was arrested in St. Louis for anti-Semitic bomb threats."
"You make a great argument Icon.    Although it would seem that the rights of women should be encompassed in 'We the People"", it clearly did not give full citizenship rights to women (or blacks), and therefore it stands to reason that political action would be necessary to assure the full status of women.

We share the opinion that there is no such thing as going backward in time.  Culture changes, technology changes, medical treatment changes, even our bodies/lifespan are different.  

I don't know if you meant 'backward-thinking' as in thinking from the past, or if that was an insult to the intelligence or education of conservative women who disagree with your opinions?

It's fine if  a woman pursues marriage and being primary leader of a families domestic life, if that's what she wants.   I have no problem with woman pursing a working career and splitting time with home needs.    It's the choice of the woman, or couple, not mine."
"And the trucks we are going to harvest the energy from, are going to have to use more fuel. Energy from your ear is also not going to smelt ore or boil a kettle.

"Sorry, but I will never get this. There is no such thing as ""living your life as a (fill in the  gender)."" There are cultures where it's the norm for men to wear skirt-like clothes (like some African tribes), layers of necklaces, jewelry and face paint. There are cultures where men normally wear robes. Women in small Western farm towns typically wear denims, even overalls and often no makeup. You ""live"" your life according to your hobbies, not what you wear or what your name is. I'm sure Jillian does the same things for fun and necessity that he did before the medical interventions. How is he living any differently these days other than clothes, name and being referred to as a ""she""? It's despicable that someone would contemplate ending their life (and thus leave a wake of destruction for their family) just because they ""feel"" like the opposite sex trapped in the ""wrong"" body. Where was this disorder 200 years ago?"
"The ACA was closely modeled after the program all Republicans praised Romney for in Massachusetts.
When a Black President proposed it nationally, Southern Republicans immediately switched to hating it."
"Well, since the local Klan was only after the Catholics, the current black students at the U of O only should feel 'unsafe' if they happen to be Catholic.

Of course, since there were hardly any blacks in Oregon until they were brought in during WWII to work in Kaiser's plants in Portland, the Klan didn't have a lot of them to use as targets."
"I believe strongly in free speech but I believe kneeling is the wrong approach.  As a WASP, I do not have the life experiences of a minority and the Black community in particular.  That being said, this country has paid, and will continue to pay, a high price for those injustices until they cease to exist in any meaningful way.  Kneeling for the anthem alienates the very people they wish to influence.  I love this country.  It is not and never will be perfect but we can continue to strive for that perfection so we will be closer to that perfection.  There are more productive and meaningful ways to achieve social justice and I commend Marshall for his community outreach which I do think is productive.  However, the flag stands for the system which has allowed his success and for which many died including 600,000 in the civil war which freed the slaves.  May we all stand up for justice, not kneel to pressure.  By the way, Kaepernick is not playing because he was horrible last year."
"If you're opposed to ""big government,"" you should be for sanctuary cities: local police (and the tax dollars you pay them to operate) shouldn't be wasted on the work of the Federal Government (which handles immigration and customs matters).

If you want a ""safe city,"" you should be for sanctuary cities: if people of color and immigrants, many of whom are here legally, feel as though they or their friends and family will be arrested, detained, questioned, or otherwise harassed over immigration matters, they won't talk to the police. They need to TRUST the police, report crime, give witness statements, etc, in order for the police to be able to enforce the laws effectively. People trust the police in sanctuary cities.

Sanctuary cities are AFFORDABLE and SAFE cities.

The facts don't lie. There are no reasons to oppose sanctuary cities other than bigoted, outdated views of ""them"" taking from ""us."""
"The sad thing about those misfortunates is many did not know that Obamacare and the ACA are the same thing.  Their ignorance plays right into the hands of the rightwing.  They love their ACA coverage, but hate Obamacare ...because that must be a benefit that others were getting, you know, those ""urban"" people ... and because Obama was black, but that's an argument for another day."
"I am glad to see Lara Trump's interest in helping animals including wild horses and burros. Hopefully she can get them back on their legal public lands and adjoining areas as complete habitats for viable herds. The so called Appropriate Management Levels and the Zeroings out, or eliminations on their rightful land in BLM and US Forest Service governed regions are not at all fair, nor are the grazing resource allocations and water provisions. etc. See my website thewildhorseconspiracy dot org and contact your Senators and all Senators on Appropriations Committee to stop the Kill Option concerning our wild horses and wild burros. I am an ecologist and worked with WH Annie. My book is The Wild Horse Conspiracy avail. on my website or on amazon"
"You obviously do not live in the 38th and Blake area. Houston has no zoning. Perhaps those who don't like restrictions should try that city. That being said, I agree many of solutions that have been proposed should be tried where it is appropriate. It is defining what is 'appropriate' that is the challenge. 'Devil in the details'"
"As opposed to the ""Black Super Predator, Planned Parenthood selling baby parts defending, Bring them to heel"" Democrats?"
"This is not a black issue - as the headline suggests - this is about allegations of corruption and the structure of business deals with government departments in South Africa. 
Unfortunately, this article seems - again - to be blaming lack of success on the ethnicity of the operator. 
I can't agree with this premise.
What your article is really saying is that a 'new' business in this country may experience difficulty securing contracts if it does not have the capital to pay bribes.  
Ok, that is a vital discussion, worthy, vital to the prosperity and success of the nation and well worth pursuing. But I'd suggest it is nothing to do with the colour of the business operator/owner. 
(And as an aside, there are opportunities in South Africa for new black-owned companies, which can be denied to those that struggle to meet the ever-changing BBEEE requirements for national and regional government contractors.) 
Some people - of all ethnicities - are just not very good at business."

"History and anthropology tells us that North and South America did not originated any human life form. That means that all humans in this hemisphere came from else where. This includes the Natives, Europeans, Blacks, Hispanics and finally last but not the least, Asians like myself. But just because I am last, don't make me feel like I am inferior nor do I considered the natives who were here first, to be my superior.  Other people also discovered the western hemisphere, like the Nordic people or Chinese long before Columbus, maybe even going back to ancient Romans or Africans!! But it was Columbus who announced it to the Europeans and direct result of that was the founding of our nation.  History is often grossly politically incorrect since it does offend people. But changing holidays will not change nothing of what happened in the past nor will it make it better. It window dressing at worst. It time to move on, accept what Columbus did and not feel the guilt of being here."
"I disagree. 
"" San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States."" -->http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000691077/article/colin-kaepernick-explains-why-he-sat-during-national-anthem
- 
Taking a knee or sit during the National Anthem by Colin Kaepernick was a protest.  And Trump's subsequent act is a counter protest against such a protest during the National Anthem."
"Oh my, maybe we should be concerned. What were you training for, and what nasty plans do you know of? Are people from Oklahoma and West Virginia among the evil, or is it just Alabama and Mississippi? Are any black residents in on it? How about the Cubans and snowbirds in Florida?"
"You are wrong.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States

See specifically the segments on Native Americans, Black slaveholders, Intertribal slaveholders, Barbary pirates, and asian slavery.  

That ignored the virtual slavery of indentured servitude and servitude imposed as the condition of a criminal conviction. Everyone even slaves had rights (of one sort or another) and depending upon the area of the country those rights varied significantly (see NEW ORLEANS)"
"I disagree with Black's slant on this one, but still respect Civil Beat for fighting for transparency.  However, was it necessary to mention the judge's relationship with Ige's campaign?  Or maybe more so, was it necessary to feature the fact as the photo's only caption?"

"Thank you for your clear, persuasive discussion.  I hadn't known that Jesus said anything about mercy vs. sacrifice.  

A question for you:  What does Jesus say about mercy vs. justice in this world.  I know that in the next world, we won't stand a chance if Jesus is pure justice.  We'll all be in a beggar's posture.  But tell me how you think that equation works out in THIS life.  The question is important to me, because I was a career prosecutor (now retired) always seeking to secure justice while also trying to extend mercy.  I was rarely satisfied that I got it right.  I'd like to know what you think."
"I work in a huge IT company, never met anyone from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Sudan, Somalia, Yemen or Libya doing IT job without a Western diploma or experience. Blame HR not me. My social circle is fine, there are quite a few brainiacs, none from the ME or Africa. I know a few ME folks working in a call center, reading scripts, not really an IT job."
Do you ever see black helicopters?
"Fourth, the police acted fairly because within SECONDS of stopping her they were informed that she was a state attorney, who they stopped for no reason and who has the ability to make their lives very difficult if they mistreat her. Hence the bowing and scraping. If they stopped some 'random' black man who was equally innocent but not as polished or informed as to his rights, would they have been so polite, given him their names, and let him drive on without any follow-up? Or would they have grilled him on where he got the car, why his plate wasn't coming back, what he was doing in the area, etc.? And if you thought Ayala's responses appeared 'aggravated' in this video (even though she was polite to a fault), how would the police have interpreted this black man's responses? Very possible this hypothetical man could lose his life in this confrontation, which is the problem."
"Catherine Rampell relies on polls & percentages in her attempt to make her vacuous points. 
   In fact, all people have plenty of reason to question pols & stuff put out by govt. We're in a low inflation stage - right? But prices keep climbing, the dollar value is plummeting, because the govt. data has thrown out consideration of the cost of fuel, groceries & other every day necessities.
   BO's birth certificate, when finally produced was a phone, listing him as being born in Kapiolani Hospital which did not exist at the time of his birth, listing his father as black, but in those days blacks were referred to as Negros.  But BO got a pass on that, too.
  BO promised ""you can keep your doctor"" & countless other influential statements that proved to be willful lies.
   Naw, MsRampell, your socialist, globalist baloney has been Trumped!"
"""It has been more of a recognition that if you're going to remove those subsidies … how are you going to address these individuals who will be without? What is that plan?"" Murkowski said.

Indeed, Senator, what's the plan? It's been 7 years since the passage of the ACA and not a single conservative has come up with an actual plan. Murkowski doesn't want the government mandating what an insurance plan must cover, she much prefers allowing private insurance companies to do that...because that worked so well before.

 ""What's the plan?"" Geez...here are some things more likely to happen before conservatives come up with a plan:

Mississippi will become the academic achievement leader of the nation 
Beings from another planet will visit us
The second coming
Jeff Sessions will join the BLM movement
Mat-Su residents will get tired of electing crackpot legislators

What's the Plan? Ferchrissakes Senator, if you don't have a plan by now then sit down and shut up until you do."
"I love your victim blaming. The fault is clearly the officer's, or his training.  On a stop involving a missing taillight, the first mistake was going up to the car with gun out.  And what don't you get about Black Lives Matter?  It means exactly ""all lives matter.""  I love the poor attempt to spin it into a anti-racial attempt, but you can't ignore racism in this country, and you can't have ""All Lives Matter"" without having ""Black Lives Matter"" too."
You need to learn the definition of racist.  And bolstering your argument by pointing out that 10% black people voted for Trump is kind of pointless since the vast majority (90%) didn't vote for him.
I would agree it's not necessarily racist to feel uncomfortable.  It's a different matter when it comes to supporting legislation to ban it.
"I'm not ""loyal"" to Zille, as such – I've never met her, and don't know her. I do tend to stick up for the underdog, though – I don't like to see obvious unfairness.

I agree 100% on De Lille and her pro-development policy. She should never have been given a second term as mayor.

Zille's error was that she tried to rush things. I can understand why – she could see that SA has a limited period in which to rid itself of the ANC, or it will be too late. She wanted the DA to take power as soon as possible, so that SA could be turned back from the precipice. To do that, the DA needed the black vote. To do that, the DA needed (in her mind) a black leader. THAT is where things went wrong. Her choices of possible black leaders for the DA have been abysmal. What we have now is a DA that probably WON'T be able to save SA, because it is rapidly turning into the ANC. Coalition government may still save us, but however we look at it, our future is depressingly uncertain."
"This whole passionate issue  of ""firing people"" is ridiculous.  -It's not going to happen.  A senior, tenured law professor can be fired about as easily as a bicycle can tow a truck.  Some of those who signed the petition may be tenured as well and they're not going to be fired for a legal act.

As to what the law professor's actual motivation was, I don't know and won't rush to judgement  til I see the results of the investigation.  Her public ""apology"" was questionable, as she refused to acknowledge the social nature of her act-- she studiously avoided any reference to ""Blackface"", admitting  only to using some ""black makeup.""  She also seems to believe that she is perfect and can do no wrong, as she was shocked that ""I, of all people"" could be accused of lack of sensitivity.
But these are certainly not ""firing offenses"", and I'd urge that we all calm down until we actually know more about what did happen.  And then we need to patch up the bad feelings this event has caused."
Would you suggest rounding them up and putting them in camps or something else? when you refer to 'these people' are you only referring to the nazi/supremicist or the antifa/BLM/SURJ racists? Who makes that determination and where is the line drawn between acceptable and punishable views? In that light it appears quite totalitarian - much like what progressives are fighting for. Knee jerk virtue signaling and moral posturing are so easy and do nothing but crush honest debate.
"Granted, it is very unfortunate that people were injured!  Hopefully they will soon recover successfully!   As far as being a sociopath, that may be correct about a few things.  My point here was that the article brought up an unnecessary point about the black smoke when there were other issues more worthy of our attention."
"I have a very different view of the Dallas incident.  I think most Americans could not care less about the people needlessly killed by police because of their confront and control at any cost tactics.  Blacks are not the only victims of the carnage - witness Babb right here locally.  No people just don't care.  Note the standard response is do what the cops say and you won't be killed which completely ignores the adverse circumstances, fear, shock, and other factors that influence an individual's response when confronted by police.  Well, protests and calls for reform have led to nothing.  Now, with establishment lives on the line, I think we will finally see some serious consideration of what is wrong with police tactics.  Compassion is not in the play book of many Americans, but self interest is.  I think it took Dallas for many Americans to even consider that there is a problem.  Maybe now we can begin to work on solutions."

"I am sorry you believed he did not care.  I am sorry you do not realize our economy has recovered faster than most any other in the world from the recession in progress when he was elected - things are tough all over.  
I guess YOU didn't care about all the people without health insurance that have it now, but he did. I am sorry you had no idea that before the ACA, health care costs were driving this country bankrupt, and since the ACA health care costs per capita have come down.  
I am sorry you voted for a congress who blocked our majority-elected President in every way and even put our economy in jeopardy by not passing a budget, just because they hated the black man.
I am sorry that you liked having such a large portion of our precious young men overseas fighting in wars that New Orleans drowned because even the National Guard was in Iraq.  Obama brought them home and put down Osama Bin Laden, but I guess you don't care.

Let me educate you. I'll speak plainly so you and your minions can understand.
What the Vostok cores taught us is that the increases in c02 consistently lag behind temperature increases by about 800 years.
This proves increased levels of c02 do not cause warming if it doesn't happen until after the warming.
They also learned that 325,000 years ago (long before the great scientists al sharpton and al gore were born) long before black lives matter appeared on the earth, the global temperatures and c02 levels were higher than they are today

"I don't want ""balance "" from Trump. I want him to bulldoze the establishment swamp that is destroying what is left of America. That's but just another of those nice-sounding word weapons the left loves to abuse in order to manipulate people--like sensitivity, bipartisanship, compromise, maverick, women's rights, and homophobe, etc."
Fr Orobator makes another point.  These women will come from the same African tradition he did and they will have a very different conceptualization of God.  They will know God in both a female and male context and will have experienced powerful women spiritual leaders.  Traditional spiritual traditions are no where near as male dominated as traditional Christianity.  It may be that the theology you seek will come from the African women he is mentoring and empowering.
"Targeting Christian businesses when there are a thousand other providers isn't an honest business transaction.   

I remember being on a business trip....with Marine reserve duty coming up that weekend...needed a haircut..as I was getting back home on the red eye with reserve duty the next morning.  I went into a barber shop in the city where I was working during lunch. Everyone in there was black...customers/barbers, people hanging out, but somehow or other I never got called to take a seat!  Waited an hour, while others were offered the seat.

So did I whine and sue for racial discrimination?  Did I try to shut their business down?

Said a prayer for them as I left...borrowed a battery clippers in the parking lot of the reserve center and shaved my head. 

It's the forced, finger in your eye, arm twisting ""I will run you out of business"" that is causing the division."
"sanctimonious,

   That's right.
    Everybody is good,  smart, worthy of respect.
   But I must say, in my humble opinion, The Work Farce is better, smarter and more worthy of respect.
        Here's why: The Work Farce supported Bernie Sanders for President. The polls showed he beats Trump by a large number. The Work Farce has been advocating for almost 50 years every policy Sanders has been advocating, from anti-racism and saving the environment to universal health care and affordable university;  social justice and equal rights for all.
    Only a political revolution and an economic transformation can bring more equality for women, African-Americans, the LGBTQ community,and ethnic minorities. More for Main Street, less for Wall Street. That's social democracy. The role models these 50 years have been the Scandinavian nations. Bernie calls it democratic socialism. That must have scared the middle class. Too bad. Hillary would have changed little for the struggling working class."
"If drugs are a crime and you do not want them to be, change the law. If you are attempting to stop drugs from entering society then stop it. The fact is there is a market for drugs. It is not pursued by free open market enterprise so, it is pursued by black market interests. That is a seedy side of the coin. See Chicago. That is where all American population centers are headed. It is the drug market creating these problems. Stop the drug market. There is a lot of influence, money and power behind it so, ask yourself why it still exists. Because those rich, powerful, influential people want it to exist."
"Negro (plural Negroes) is a term traditionally used to denote persons considered to be of Negroid heritage. It can be used honorably or derogatorily.

  Same for the descendants of indigenous immigrants of North America.  There is no reason to believe that the Mohawk High School is using the term in a derogatory context."
Is it democracy if more than half of the party is corrupt? Well you will see next elections democracy will not be in the ANC favor anymore. People are sick of this cancer in our country. We are moving backwards not forward. And if black people are happy with that keep enjoy the poverty that your ANC provides without solutions. 22 years and we are now more far apart than ever.http://idis.uonbi.ac.ke
"Making marijuana illegal will not stop the black market, it didn't before nor will it now.  More people who are buying it legally now will simply go back to the black market.  I am not an advocate either way but smart enough to know the basic facts.  Alcohol and cigarettes are much worse and cost way more to society than marijuana ever will."

"Jim, it was a great book and I'm glad your Mom-and many others read it.  In fact as a sociologist back in the 60s I also encouraged my students to read  it.  However, that was then and this is now.  Comparing this to Shurtz's behavior is a stretch, as Griffin's brave trip through the Deep South produced much  racial understanding whereas her Halloween party  for her students has caused mostly confusion and anger, well intentioned as it may have been.

If we REALLY want to know how African-Americans feel today, I'd ask you and all posters here to join me in urging our local NAACP to hold a panel discussion with representative community members to discuss ""What it feels like to be a black in Eugene today."""
"Provided access to the right medical training, Mr. Riek should be able to continue his compassionate medical work and interest.  Have you ever heard of Vivien Thomas?  Vivien Thomas was a black man who paved the way for open heart surgery.  Vivien was barred from earning his medical degree back in the 1930s because he was black and back then universities didn't recognize minority students.  Vivien started out working at the prestigious Johns Hopkins University clean dog kennels for Dr. Alfred Blalock who was a medical researcher and surgeon.  Blalock was credited with introducing the groundbreaking Blue Baby lung surgery, which led into open heart surgery.  Few people are even aware that it was a black man that first introduced open heart surgery.  Ageism will play a factor in Mr. Riek's ability to work in the medical field.  By the way, Raven, who gave you the authority to determine someone else's qualifications.  Mr. Riek likely have far more advanced skills than you do.  Right?"
"I don't care for the current government but they do have more veterans and far more internal defence expertise than the late Conservatives ever did. I have a strong suspicion that the much wiser cabinet members like the MND and LGen Leslie have been key in getting rid of  what would be a misguided, strategically bungled UN mission in Africa. 
Any public support for it would have promptly melted away with the first ramp ceremony in Trenton returning dead service members."
"1st quote... ""Cost estimates for the city’s 20-mile, 21-station rail project from East Kapolei to Ala Moana Center dra­matically escalated from $5.26 billion in late 2014 to nearly $10 billion now, INCLUDING FINANCING COSTS. The project is being funded mostly from the half-percent excise tax surcharge on Oahu, which generates about $250 million per year.""

10 billion for construction costs of 8.2 billion. The 10 billion is the projected revenue so by definition it includes financing costs in its 1.8 billion contingency. 

2nd article says the same but includes a quote from the city about the contingency... ""City officials say the House version isn’t going to provide enough money because it doesn’t factor in between $1.4 billion and $2 billion in debt service on bonds that are needed for the project to maintain cash flow in the next few years when the greatest costs are being incurred.""

"Hi DC,  As I continue my reading on this subject as it applies to Oregon, I was wondering if your e-mail in your book ""From Camas to Courthouse:  Early Lane County History"" is still good?

Also, are any of the buildings on the U of 0 (zero) campus named for any minorities, other than the exclusion of African-American?  Since Sheldon's history book was written in 1940, I'm not surprised at the omission of the very few African-Americans who may have had anything to do with the U of 0 (zero) up to that time.  Are there black professors, administrators, and students now at the U of 0 (zero)?  Should the streets of Eugene be named according to proportional representation of minorities?  Should the community over-compensate for any minority that chooses to come to Oregon/Lane County/Eugene?  If so, at what point is ""acceptable compensation"" reached?"
"If he condemns their group(s) by name he would also have to condemn BLM, Antifa and whatever else was out there.  He said ""many sides"" which covers the mess impartially.

He is not going to offer that, as he shouldn't."
"First and foremost Bean's Cafe is responsible for the unsafe environment.  Bean's Cafe & surrounding area are cesspools. They should be shut down. Adminstrative officials have refused to meaningfully create rules or regulations for those receiving charity.  They recklessly allow gatherings which are made up of felons, addicts, degenerates. Bean's Cafe is basically a place where these low lifes squatter without any accountability.

Our first responders lives are in jeopardy. Our public coffers are drained policing the area. Our community is at risk in every way without any remarkable benefit. Start fining Bean's Cafe for unsanitary, unsafe, criminal environment."
"What pisses me off more is the fact that the BLM can do more they just choose not too , I do understand about managing the herds and when I said to feed them is by putting hay on the government land not just in there holding pins so there not taking all the grazing from the ranchers for there cows it is that little extra that might make a difference but who am I to say I am just a woman in a man's world ."

Back when all this started, I clicked ""confirm"" on a couple of requests.  The next thing I knew, I was getting ads for shoes and fashions on my wall.  I defriended the shills and the ads stopped.

So mostly it's just seems to be people trying to make money through clicks on Facebook ads."
"Ah yes, the racist card. It is all you liberals really have isn't it? And you never disproved my point Ed. Your opinion is not a fact. His statement is. So I take it you don't disagree that the original ACLU founders' intent was communism.

"In trumps mind no one of color is really innocent, so of course he's not wrong."
"Are you kidding me ?  To keep repeating the injustice that done to blacks and compare it to bathroom safety is an outrage .  This issue has nothing to do with color.  It has everything to do with people who are so misguided they refuse to accept the way they were born . They want to force they're their problem on everyone else.  Just saying to trust people that clearly have issues to not hurt anyone while they use the wrong bathroom is insane. It's like telling someone not to not wear a seat belt because you probably won't get in an accident anyways.   This is clearly about people with issues wanting to force their chosen lifestyle on others.  Nothing could be more simple---if your a man , use the men's bathroom . If your a woman , use the women's . If your confused as to what you are , check your own birth certificate or do a self check in front of a mirror  .  Problem solved.   If your a man pretending to be a woman---you need help . People need to accept the way they are born ."

"On the other hand, what these people are protesting, they live with 7 days a week.  We have had a black friend who said he got followed around in stores because clerks think he will shop lift.  This is a fellow we met in church.  I usually don't associate church and shoplifting. 

What the players did has caused a lot of discussion/arguements at our house.  The flag and our nation stand for the ability of people to protest, whether we like it or not.  That includes the Klan and it includes NFL players."

""Graduates of University of Oregon School of Law mainly take the bar in Oregon and Washington.
In these two states, its graduates did 2.8% worse on average than all graduates from all law schools taking the exam in the same two states.""  

This means University of Oregon School of Law doesn't do a good job of preparing its students for the bar exam in these states.""

"My goodness, how different our perspectives can be.  First, indeed, the election of an African American President was devisive, or more correctly put, brought forth the divisiveness of racism which has lurked in the shadows.  Over the Obama Presidency we saw millions, yes millions, of racist posts attacking him.  We saw websites created just to host those racist rants......yes, indeed, that African American fellow Obama had the termidity to be elected President.  You say ""shame on him.""  May I disagree.  President Obama, at literally every step, worked to achieve consensus.  He would take two steps to the ""righ"" on issues seeking that consensus.  The GOP Congress, in turn, would take their two steps......further to the right.  To state President Obama was ""unwilling to work with the other party"" is silliness.

"I keep reading comments like that and when I do, I think of the Muslims I know and work with who seem to be every bit as much interested in integrating as, say, my wife's immigrant Dutch parents or the parents of the Italian kids I grew up with.  The first generation to come over, in both cases, tended to stick with many of the ""old country"" beliefs, values and lifestyle.  My wife's parents stayed with the Christian Reformed Church, sent their kids to Christian Reformed schools, ate Dutch food and made trips back ""home"".  In the Italian community, the elderly women wore black head to toe and covered their heads with shawls.  The children, however, ended up as Canadian as hockey pucks.  This ""they won't integrate"" routing is old and tired."

"Reducing the speed limit and shortening passing lanes (as ODOT did recently) do not reduce the accidents.  What they really do is increase the dangerous passing and road rage.  Having driven from Eugene to Florence weekly for work I can tell you that inconsiderate drivers who refuse to pull to the side to let faster traffic pass are are huge problem.  I asked a deputy once on KPNW's Wake up Call, why they don't enforce the ""obstructing the flow of traffic"" law.  His answer, ""because the person passing unsafely gets a bigger ticket"".  He acknowledged the road rage this causes and said it leads to reckless driving which is a much larger fine.  Hwy 38 from Scottsburg to I-5 is much safer because there are so many passing lanes that the 80 mph big pick up's blowing black smoke can safely pass.  16 would be much safer had Kitty and her litter mates not shut down the ""West Eugene Parkway""."

This very newspaper has run a long-term series isolating out sexual assault above all other violent crimes for special handling. Abortion is a reality in every Canadian province, and Canadian women use that service more often than most other western nations. Birth control options are everywhere.  Churches are emptying.

"Very short article, but missing some very key pieces of data.  It claims the racism is systemic, but it doesn't explain which systems.  There's no target. it's a ghost-hunt. Which institutions, policies or laws are racist? How can a problem be corrected if it isn't properly identified? This matters.

They just used the word ""objective"" in a sense that leads to confusion, and that's where you get confused --- with the word ""objective.""  While it is true that ""sin,"" as we moderns now understand the word, requires ""subjective"" elements (knowledge and intent), it is a mistake to say that these subjective elements entail the conclusion that there is no objectively sinful act.  For if you say that, you say there was nothing objectively sinful about gassing 6 million Jews, or bringing Africans here by the millions in slave ships, or raping children in war, or assassinating Lincoln."

The Supreme Court has fashioned something out of the gossamer of the “penumbra” and called it “marriage”.

Whatever it is, it is not the thing which arose from the Natural Law."

When a policeman kills a person of color the marches and finger pointing begins.  Yet in Chicago people are dying by the hundreds---including many innocent by-standers caught in the cross fire , yet year after year after year after year  these people and groups look the other way .  Why ?  All lives matter , but since one group only points to black lives mattering---why aren't they marching in Chicago to end the slaughter ?  Why does the mayor allow the slaughter to not only continue , but to grow ?  Why not send in the national guard to go block to block to back up police as they get the illegal guns ?  One guy who attacked a cop caused a firestorm in Furgeson .  Why don't they care about Chicago ?"
"Madam, 
You cannot claim to despair of the future of journalism in this country if you rate eye witness accounts (notoriously unreliable) and anecdote....above a video recording.

I have also seen said full video and can state
1. BOTH children were girls.
2. The black girl is barely more than a toddler. Watching that man grab her (the action that catapulted the mum into a state of salivating rage) cut me deep, and I am not even a parent yet.
3. Violence against women and children should NEVER be tolerated.

This didn't become about race because the woman said so. It became racial because we opted to blind ourselves to the truth, believing ""witness accounts"" over visual recording. Perhaps Spur faked the video? How else do we explain this discrepancy, if not a double standard driven by our own secret prejudices? 

Actions always sleak louder than words."
I was referring to the neo-Nazi's and the like with those trying to use violence to stop them. I'm not the Denver post or MSM - I don't link being conservative with hate groups. I find the BLM crowd to be just as racist as the KKK. Both are groups that divide.

Just didn't get it last night...to allow him to throw the game away for a very winnable game against a poor starter and a 5 run lead. I assume Black wanted to give him every chance but come on...not in a playoff race."

"Didn't hear you bitching about the lady who was in Goth black Darth Vader outfit every game last year. Just because she's in an athletic outfit and not in a promo Aloha shirt doesn't make her any less stylish.

"The number of cases where an exemption has been lost is miniscule. One reason is that the IRS does not want to have the Johnson Amendment tested in the Supreme Court. Black churches endorse candidates all the time.

Fortunately for Catholics this rarely happens, and in fact I have been unable to substantiate one case of it occurring in the last election."
"Why don't they focus their antislavery  fervour on the continuing African slave trade in Africa and Islamic ME.  Chad, Mauritius,  Guyana, Qatar, Saudi Arabia Yemen, Ethiopia and even Indonesian all have the continuous black African slave trade that has been ongoing for thousands of years.   But nobody wants to talk about it. They  prefer to denounce Canada, which never had a slave trade."
"Try to hold a parade honoring the military men and women who ensure our rights or even try to include them in any parade in Eugene and you find out how friendly they are.  Wear a pro Trump t shirt and find out how friendly they are.  You can wear a Black Lives Matter t shirt but an American Flag t shirt causes problems. Eugene is friendly and engaging if you go along with the group think. I find Eugene very similar to Madison WI. where I came from,  77 square miles surrounded by common sense.  Personally I find Eugene very engaging.  I also find it lacking in common sense in many areas."

"Theres never really any clarity as to why SAA continues to bleed profusely . Poor inept leadership is one thing but why is the business of SAA sooo bad .? If we look at Qantas which operates in a similarly disadvantaged geographical distance from the main and profitable routes of the northern hemisphere they lost 28Billion rand in 2014 . However this was clearly due to writedowns and retrenchment of 10% of the staff But its clear why they lost that much and now theyre back in the black .Leasing aircraft which you are servicing to the tune of 3.5 billion a year is one thing that I dont understand but what as an outsider can gather it just seems theres such a lack of wanting to make money at this institution because theres the fail safe that govt will bail us out .Everytime . From the top to the bottom .
SAA needs to be sold off and listed to give it a kick forward , capital injection and bring in people who know how to run a business and not a dog show ."

"Cultural disrespect for nature is confronting us with a whole new aspect of religion that until now has been overlooked and disregarded - and that is the locus of religion and consciousness; consciousness and its place (the Naturalis Sacramentum Ordinis) are inseparably one.
It is my sense that it is nothing less than sacrilegious to belittle and discriminate against the Eucharistic character of the Sacrament of Natural Order in self-interest wasting. [Thus, my deep personal respect and reverence for the Bread of Life, Eucharistic Grain.]
The phrase 'Right as Grain' is with deep spiritual/ religious significance - that is so missing from public religious consciousness.
Bottomline: this is where authentic ""leitos ergon"" takes us and where Pope Francis (like Vatican II) means to take the People Church."
So let me get this straight ... You can't put happenings of the old world at the new world's standards ... so therefore we should praise the Old South for their  enslavement of the Africans b/c it helped to build the New South that we live in today? We should celebrate Hitler b/c he helped reshape Germany? I'm just not getting this here. Also where exactly did this author get their facts? From the Spanish Catholic library?

Did you know Nigeria is STILL in the business of selling people into slavery?"

""Before they seize power and establish a world according to their doctrines, totalitarian movements conjure up a lying world of consistency which is more adequate to the needs of the human mind than reality itself; in which. . .uprooted masses can feel at home and are spared the never-ending shocks which real life and real experiences deal to human beings and their expectations. The force possessed by totalitarian propaganda. . .lies in its ability to shut the masses off from the real world.""

"Wow, I just got one STRANGE warning from the ""Civil Comments"" system.

Up popped one of the posts I was supposed to assess for suitability.

The post said something like this:

""Islam as described in the Koran can never be satisfied until Islam has overtaken infidel beliefs worldwide - as described in the Koran it is an expansionist ideology that requires preeminent status and so you might as well start learning more about its features sooner rather than later"".

Well, I voted that the post was okay and was civil, and WHAM!, my whole webpage went black and these big words in an angry-looking red font came up saying something like ""WARNING: YOU HAVE FAILED TO REJECT A POST THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE REJECTED, YOU MUST EMPLOY MORE SCRUTINY AND SINCERITY IN YOUR ASSESSMENT EFFORTS"".

Um, hello?

Seriously, hello?

How was the guy's post uncivil? For crying out loud, I could provide quotes by Winston Churchill that were a LOT more harsh on Islam than that post! Shall we ban Churchill quotes?"
"Come on, John, why are you so afraid of gun violence research?  Don't you want to know what is happening?  At this time there is no central clearinghouse for gun death information, no legal requirement for police or coroner data.

You deny that blacks aren't targeted and killed unnecessarily by police on a weekly basis?  You think unloading a Glock into a man who is running from police is ""risking their lives"" or a response to ""death force""?

Congress banned gun research because of intense NRA pressure.  You absolutely know this, in my opinion.  I was a long-time NRA member until Wayne LaPierre and Ted Nugent and other wacko birds took over.

I will say this again, twisting the truth and hiding the truth are doing more harm to 2nd Amendment rights than any Nancy Pelosi could ever do.  You seem to think everyone is your enemy.  I am a lifelong hunter and gun owner, and I like the Pogo comment - ""We have met the enemy, and he is us.""

"I like them all, and would vote for any one of the great people you listed.

"Ruin and perdition for who?  That's a bit judgmental and condemnatory as well. (""Ruin! Perdition!"" for those who don't pray my way or gain inspiration the way I do.)  From your comments,  it seems like you are more in line with Calvanist/Islamist theory of plainness, no decorations, no ""distractions"" of any kind to interfere with your communication with God.  That's absolutely fine.  If that's what helps you, personally, communicate with and feel connected to God,  and it enables you to deepen your feeling of  God's presence, wonderful!   But there are many OTHER ways people achieve the same connection and communication with God and feel God's presence.  And those are just as valid.  The black Baptist churches are famous for their choirs, and for the whole congregation clapping, singing and shouting out 'Amens' and ""Alleluias"", enriching their sense of connection with their faith and with God.  Personally, that's not my style, but it is just as valid and wonderful as mine or yours."
"If that's embarrassing then what do you call it when the UN reviews human rights in Canada and comes to the conclusion that racism against  blacks is so systemic and ingrained in Canadian society that it's barely noticed by the majority. It's so much a part of Canadian history that to this day its part of every institution.
It's in an article buried in this website that doesn't rise to the  importance of the 3 or 4  front page articles on American athletes who kneel."
"Here in Eugene, we have witnessed the reality of how the lynch mobs worked in days of old.  Back then a black would transgress his imagined proper behavior and be strung up to die for the perceived transgression.  The intent of the transgression did not matter only its occurrence.   In rational and reasoned Eugene many want to destroy the professional life of a woman who simply put black makeup on her face in her own home because she transgressed their view of her proper behavior.   It doesn't matter why she did it only that she did.  Needless to say, the old lynching and current lynching are incompatible with a free respectful society.  Educated UO faculty who partook in the attempted lynching should be ashamed and apologize for theirs is the worse offense given its intended, not inferred, intent."
"The ""no-disparagement"" clause was there from the beginning when Black Press bought the former Star-Bulletin in 2001. It was contained in an agreement that all Star-Bulletin employees had to sign in order to be ""rehired"" by Black's Star-Bulletin. I remember being upset about it at the time."
"The dog was clearly out of its property. Its body was across the property line, so the sonic fence wasn't a deterrent.

We owned a beautiful black Lab for 15 years who thought it was her job as family dog to rush the FENCED property line when people walked too close. A woman pepper sprayed her once because she feared Kana would come over that fence. Kana meant no harm. She was bluffing and she never went over the fence, but she was big, black and scary and the woman had a little kid with her. I could see why it happened. Kana learned not to rear up on the fence because of that incident.

We have since had a Lab husky mix who would and did ignore a sonic fence to intimidate other dogs. We recognized her as a potential threat to herself if not to children and dogs, so we installed a real fence of substantial height to keep her in.

The owners of this dog were negligent with the life of their dog. This was bound to happen sooner or later. Aggressive dogs should be fenced with real fences!"

"Some Conservatives are claiming that M 103 threatens freedom of expression through the alleged criminalization of criticizing Islam and is a step on the path to implementing Sharia law in Canada.

This is pure nonsense. This is a non-binding motion — not a law — and the motion itself clearly states that even the proposed study of the issues must respect the Charter of Rights. A non-binding motion could not override the Charter, especially given the clear reference to the Charter in the motion itself."
"Legacy treatment IS preferential, but private institutions that depend on funding by alumni are not ""invidiously"" discriminatory when they give such preference.  Harvard taking in Bush on account of ""legacy"" is not like Harvard denying Obama admission on the basis of his skin color.  The former has at least some rationality to it; the latter, none.

As for equality of access to lawyers:  You really think Jesus insisted that society provide the poor man with as good a lawyer as money can buy?  What planet are you on?"
"Ike had no ""moral authority"" to protect the students from the mobs and Arkansas State government threatening to kill them?  No ""moral authority"" to protect black citizens anywhere in the Civil Rights era from the mobs, local law enforcement, and bigots with military personnel and weapons?  National guards have been used to maim and kill striking workers in almost every state in the union where all were smeared with the brand of communism.  The Declaration of Independence is ""not"" the Constitution and its Bill of Rights.  The intent of all of these people and groups is to destroy the laws under our Constitution to be replaced by those with enough arms to take it all away from other people.  They are all just traitors, and in too many cases mentally deranged."
"To complete the analogy, ATF, shouldn't you add that many say exclusion of African Americans as bible based? As a Christian freedom issue?"
"' And Senator Jeff Sessions, the nominee for attorney-general, has been criticized by civil-liberties advocates for what they consider his regressive views on the rights of women, sexual minorities and African Americans. '

What specific things did he do that were ""regressive.""  Even his Justice Dept. officials in DC said at the time when Sessions was a prosector in Alabama is that he (Sessions) vigorously prosecuted hate crimes against black Americans when others in the South were reluctant to do so.

You also say discrimination (past and present)  keeps African Americans from owning homes.  I think discrimination exists, but this is an off the wall statement that would have us believe this is the total cause.  It is not.  Lack of education, skills, and good jobs leading to lower income does not allow them to get on the housing ladder.  This is not discrimination, it is economics, attributed to social policies designed to keep black support for the Democrats.

Fake News Ibbotson!"
"Eugene'60:  We're seeing the logical extention of the anti-intellectualism which has characterized GOP politics since the Nixon campaign.  His VP (later forced to resign and replaced by Gerald Ford) Spiro T. Agnew referred to ""nattering nabobs of negativism"" and commented about ""A spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals. ""  So yes, the Party has both appealed to and encouraged anti-intellectualism.....and it's worked.  In many ways Trump is a reincarnation of Agnew, appealing to the basest instincts of the constituency, promoting devisiveness, demonizing those with different worldviews and blaming blacks, immigrants, women, and effete Democrats for all the ills of our country.  ""They"" are the cause of those ills and Donald Trump is the cure......there,  that was pretty simple, wasn't it.  

We can elect Trump and once again prove Pogo was right ""we've met the enemy and it is us."""

"Meet some of the people who would identify with the demographics these groups speak for and you'll find a great deal of disagreement over the expected behaviour of their representatives.

It is a mistake to think that all black youth and lgbt think alike. But people seem to be making that mistake because they have come to form the identities of all lgbt and black youth based on the characteristics of BLM and Pride extremists. Unfortunately too much media attention on these unrepresentative groups tends to homogenize the view of the related demographic, to their own detriment.

Fortunately, there is at least one voice on the G&M oped board who understands the perils of this. It is always a pleasure to read Wente's correcting opinions."
I am kind of partial to paint it black.
"Conservatives need to stop talking about the Rich. O'Leary only talks about money, profit, and return on investment. This has little to do with good government.

Conservatives, if they want to carve out a place for themselves on the political landscape, need to outline how they'd help the poor, the weak, and the elderly. How they'd help children, women, people of colour, immigrants & refugees, and First Nations.

We already know Conservatives want to help Bay Street. We know they want to help Big Oil, Big Pharma, and Big Business. It's the Little People who vote and who need convincing. Harper claimed to be helping Little People, but he lost their trust after four years of Majority Government.

Our Constitution speaks of Peace, Order & Good Government. We need to hear answers as to how Conservatives will bring us those three things. So far, all I'm hearing is twaddle."
"It was so nice of the Senator to waste 30 minutes of the nominee's time.   Sounds like she didn't meet with him and discuss his qualifications or interest in serving on the court.  Sounds more like she just abused the guy.  How's that for winning the hearts and minds and showing real Alaskan hospitality.  She's daddy's girl.  I'm so glad she's protecting my Second Amendment rights.  Any second now, I know the men in black helicopters are going to arrive at my door and take my guns away.   I'm so scared I think I better have a Koch."
"Pandora: Hmmm...walk a mile in the shoes of a woman of color, who experienced blatant racism throughout her Catholic school years by many students while being told herself to be tolerant (weekly). Who sees current discriminatory practices utilized when girls are forbidden to be altar servers and LGBTQ persons denied the dignity to marry in the church. Your own privilege is clearly showing by your response and misses the point of welcoming those who've always felt on the outside. Your response perpetuates fear and disappointment young Catholics face when trying to reach out for community within the walls of the traditional church. Your response lets me know you would not acknowledge my presence if you saw me in church or walking by you. Classic responses such as, ""my parish is different, I'm not privileged/racist/etc... or my all time favorite is - well you misunderstood what I said,"" only invite and create further distancing from the RC church. Listen, be proactive, reach out, Peace."
"My own take is that the underlying agenda here is to unseat the Middle East in terms of power.   Seeing Trump's comments in the past and Putin's comments in the past, they both regard  it with contempt.  Putin has a big issue with the terrorism on his doorstep, both from the Middle East and pawns like Chechnya.  Even more so than does the U.S.A.  If you look at the oil situation here in North America now, and  also consider the possibility that Venezuela can be redeemed economically and politically, and add to that the might of Russia's oil producing capacity, an interesting opportunity presents itself.   That being an embargo on Middle East states who promote terrorism both by funding and political ties.  We could not have done that two decades ago, now perhaps we can.   The world managed to turn South Africa from apartheid in the 90's.  It would be a wonderful thing for this world if Islamic terrorism faced the same fate as apartheid."
"To those who think that the horrable PR that Alaska is recieving on this Issue is OK because tourism is increasing; beware. Make no mistake, for the State to allow a hand full of Hunters and trappers to  bait the iconic park wolves and bears [most of them with radio collars] out of the park and gun them down is, a huge black eye. This lack of concern for a word-class resorce is seen by the the vast majority of People, not just in Alaska but nationally and recently even internationally, as, literally; a crime against nature. Just in the last month, stories on this travesty have run in the the Washington Post, USA Today UK Guardian, yahoo News AP Wire Service, and Many more.  There are a-lot  of ways this can impact Alaska in a negative way, some are obvious, some unforeseen. But the Governor should not ignore the outcry."

You have the PC in Hi and the PC in the south (those who want to remove a statue of a Confederate General [anything to do with history is now racist, according to the PC].  What's next, some PC is going to complain about King Kamehameha's statue?  Don't forget about the two gays who complained about the cross at the Makakilo off ramp 'cause this is your future.

"Given that the Inner City birth of Dr. Ben is trumpeted as qualification for the position, I would simply ask, ""What has he done lately?"" Better yet, has he been there lately? A further question could be asked about his affiliation with Black congregations of the SDA church, even occasionally, as a supportive, visible, inspiring, role model. He will probably get the post but I do not expect much, given the out of touch attitude toward the inner city of our President Elect who may nominate him.

I agree with the earlier comment that he would be better as Health and Human Services Secretary given his stellar medical credentials. Seems to me Dr. Ben is being nominated for the post simply because he is Black and came out of the inner city a ""thousand"" years ago.

Seems Dr. Ben adjusted his Adventism to run in the first place and adjusted his position to accept a post in the new administration, maybe he will adjust his attitude toward the inner city and do well. Pray church!"

"I am quite sure Anglicans in Third World countries -- primarily, Africans (where numerically most Anglicans in the world live) -- will eventually come around and ordain women -- simply because they are fundamentalist in regard to Scripture, highly Protestant (like US African American churches/members who ordain  women and have very little regard for Tradition). First world Anglicans/Episcopalians, however, are a dying group. They are less than 1% of the US, demographically invisible and hardly gentry as their small parishes absorb more diverse and poorer segments of the population. Even in England, only 19% of the population identifies as Anglican. It has become just another religious subculture. When the titular head of the English Anglian Church (the Church of England) passes on, it will collapse even more. The future of Anglicanism is in Africa, where it will be highly Protestant, irrespective of Catholic costume, liturgical clothing, etc."
"Actually, the Dems were doing quite a bit of diddling of their own last night. Dekalb County is the second largest county in the state, voted over 80% D in 2016.  It is the second-most-affluent county with an African-American majority in the United States. Two polling places were allowed to stay open half an hour longer because ONE registered voter was mistakenly turned away. And as for gerrymandering, Dems tried it BIG TIME here in Coffman's district, violating our state law that it is a congressional function, not a judicial one. He still won. Your excuses are just that. Oh, and Jeh Johnson just testified that the Russians did NOT change votes and that the DNC REFUSED his federal help to secure their servers. Hmmmmm, wonder why? That is a rhetorical question, of course. To hide what they were doing to their own."

""" Suicide, like murder, contradicts the divine world order.""

According to UNICEF - About 29,000 children under the age of five – 21 each minute – die every day.

During the Black Plague in the Middle Age. some 75,000,000 to 200,000,000 infants - toddlers - teenagers - adult men, women, pregnant women, deacons, nuns, priests, RCC hierarchy, as well as Jews, Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus as well as all other Religions were killed.

The Spanish Flu of 1918 killed from 50,000,000 to 100,000,000 worldwide.

According to HHS, in 2012 some 21,000,000 women worldwide suffered miscarriage.

So God is contradicting his own "" divine world order "".

Right ?

Further - why does God so torture and prolong the death of so many who are suffering so horribly - when he has so much human blood on his hands ?"

"How much longer will people still write, and the RG  still publish, the claim that this was   ""a private Halloween party?""  Mr. Urhausen himself would have been welcome had he come with a student or friend.
 Clearly it was very open, a virtual extension  of her class-- Prof. Schurtz officially and enthusiastically invited all her students and their friends, in fact some  students felt it was  an obligation  to attend and behave politely, thus their failure to register their concerns at the party itself.

I agree with Mr. Crum, that we've had too much "" self-righteous piousness"" which has caused even more divisiveness -- yes, it's time for all these one-sided,  nasty attacks on the UO  or Schurtz to cease as we look for ways to move on and achieve reconciliation.  
I'd like see Prof. Shurtz back in the classroom Jan. 9; an apology from the UO for making a bad scene worse; and a representative panel discussion with the NAACP on what it's really like being black in Eugene today."
"By saying the ""right"" was there legally and the ""left"" was there illegally you're repeating the LIE that even our President has told us.

The ""left"" had a permit too, but if you want to get down to technicalities neither the ""left"" nor the ""right"" had a permit to protest on the street where Heather Heyer was murdered.

But you don't actually need a permit to go out in public and just because some right-wing group gets a permit to protest in a park doesn't mean people who object to their message are not allowed to show up.

Do you really think someone's opinion determines whether or not they have a right to show up at a planned protest?   What if they turned people away because they weren't far right enough?   Would you be okay with that?   

Would you be okay with Charlottesville telling people if they don't hate Jews or black people ENOUGH they aren't allowed in the park that day?   

Do you actually believe in the First Amendment?"
"Who said ""What difference does it make?"" She reported it and that's what matters. Retaliation against reporters of a crime is a crime. Recently, when I called 9-1-1 to report stalking about a female stalking me in my numerically-assigned parking space, I was mocked by the male 9-1-1 operator when he asked me ""Are you the one stalking her?"" I felt shunned from calling 9-1-1. To make the long story short, I reported the unsafe driver online at www.reportdangerousdrivers.com
If you don't know the difference between Reserved Parking and Visitor Parking signs you are obviously an impaired driver and need attention. 
Alaska Code Section 11.41.260 & .270 clearly define Stalking; therefore, I understand repeated acts of unwanted contact at my residence including my paid parking space being used illegally without my consent by the Stalker is a crime and it was reported.

"A scholar of Islamic history at Queen's University in Kingston, Prof. Mohammad Qadeer, wrote: ""The argument about concealing one's face as a religious obligation, is contentious and not backed by the evidence. In western societies, the niqab also is a symbol of distrust for fellow citizens and a statement of self-segregation. The wearer of a face veil is conveying 'I am violated if you look at me'. It is a barrier in civil discourse. It also subverts public trust."" 

Canadian judges should meet their Pakistani colleague, Chief Justice of the Peshawar High Court, Tariq Pervaiz Khan, who ordered female lawyers to remove their face veils, saying they couldn't be identified nor assist court properly while veiled.  He scolded them, saying, ""You are professionals.""

"Your comments really show how ironic and hypocritical the left is about this man.  The news covers every minute detail about he and his family.  Recall, Barry the Wonderchild didn't get nearly the scrutiny.  It was all roses and coffee cake with Michelle and his daughters.  It was news stories about how great she looked in a dress that could be bought at Target.  But with Trump, it's stories nit picking Melania's choice of shoes.  And you on the left lap it all up and drink it down and use it to condemn him, his family and anyone associated with him.  Then, you have the gall to question someone who points out that he made billions or points out any of his other accomplishments.  And these aren't minute accomplishments.  So funny, the smallest negative news is big to you, and the biggest accomplishments by him are discarded.  I now know why liberals have houses with no mirrors."
"Yes and no.

Canada was gladly the terminus for the Underground Railroad out of slavery in the US. In Toronto, there were African Canadian city councillors (aldermen) in the 1800s. The first black newspaper in Canada was founded by Mary Shadd in Buxton, Ontario in the 1850s.

I don't mind if Canada is called out for what it did wrong; but I'd like some credit for what we did and are doing right.

We need more actual history taught in our schools and recognized in articles like this."
Thomas  -  please tell us your plan for confiscating 300 million guns from legal owners.  Attempting that will only create a black market that disarms law abiding Americans and arms criminals.  Not a good scenario.
"Yeah, not.  Your list of things requiring a license are not listed as Constitutional Rights.  Do you need a license to have legal representation?  Or a license to not be subjected to warrantless searches at the whim of government?  How about that license to have a speedy trial, or maybe even a license to worship as you please.  These things are not negotiable, I doubt you would trade them for a misguided sense of whatever you think it will accomplish.  The felony/domestic violence thing is already in force; you can't own/possess a gun with either.  There are stiff federal penalties for selling firearms as a dealer without a Federal Firearms License.  With your idea, regular citizens get the shaft, and the criminals laugh all the way to what ever crime they can commit with a gun, stolen or obtained on the black market, outside the purview of your license."
"Really, there are 4000 farms that were reclaimed using the process granted in the Constitution. But yet there is no viable black recipient for them. 90% of land claimants have taken the cash option, and 80% of those that take the land to farm fail.

The land debate is entirely a construct of deluded neo-communists who have the wrong belief that South Africa is going to revert back to a pre-modern agrarian society. It won't. People like modernity and they want jobs to pay for it. Changing the Constitution to allow for expropriation without compensation will only cost this country jobs while putting food security in jeopardy.

Please stop this dangerous and destructive talk."

The black character of Mohammad, the Islam resolve to eliminate infidels to meet the ultimate goal of Islaminazation of the world, and the preference of Shira law, are unmentioned nitty-gritty of great contradictory significance.  

Adventism is neo-Judaism already, so those cousins have already married, without reproach.

""Among its findings, the Commission notes that the illegal workers are estimated to account for as much as one-third of total immigrants in the United States, and that illegal immigration has
tended to increase the supply of low-skilled, low-wage labor available. The Commission found
also that about six in 10 adult black males have a high school diploma or less, and are
disproportionately employed in the low-skilled labor market in likely competition with
immigrants. Evidence for negative effects of such competition ranged from modest to
significant, according to the experts who testified, but even those experts who viewed the effects as modest overall found significant effects in occupations such as meatpacking and construction.""

"Read: The Seed is Mine by Charles van Onselen and Sol Plaatje’s Native Life in South Africa. The attitude of the British and Afrikaners, towards Africans, only differs by degrees - the Afrikaners perfected and legislated (i.e. deepened) the harsh racist policies of the Brits. By the way around 10 000 Africans died in that so called Anglo-Boer war that was a skirmish between two invading forces for the spoils of our defeated people. There is a long history between the English and the Afrikaners in this country and a very significant part of that has to do with the differences they had with regard to the ""native problem""."

Yes, there were MEMBERS of the KKK that were Democrats but that's a far cry from saying it was the Democrat Party that originated the KKK.  Since those early days, all of the KKK members have since switched to the Republican Party.  It's laughable that Strom Thurmond was a KKKer and he impregnated one of his families house slaves, even fell in love with her.  Storm secretly accepted and embraced his black daughter.  He even paid for all of the college.  One of his grandson's became a doctor and Strom even paid for his medical training.  There's no doubt that Strom supporters knew about his black daughter and his black grandchildren, but that didn't matter.  Supporters kept sending him back to Congress until he finally dropped dead."
"Thanks to Google, I have found that many developed countries have some version of B-BBEE, wee procurement policies are directed at benefiting/uplifting the minorities usually, usually black people as an acknowledgement of their historical deprivation. The problem in our context is corruption, not the policy itself. The second problem is that  it ignores the most serious and sustainable upliftment of the historically disadvantaged: Education. Finally, as within other areas, there are no monitoring systems or capacity, just like with the social grants and RDP houses."

Christians are fair game but millionaire athletes are protected? Rights for some, not for all? Who makes these decisions at the NFL? Since NFL players have no 1st Amendment Rights to protest on private stadium property, this means the protests are condoned by the owners. Yes, players have a right to take a knee.

"2/2
The area is the center of the Russian Black Sea fleet based in Sevastopol. Following Ukrainian independence there were unsuccessful attempts at Ukrainianization. The Russian society in general and even some government officials never accepted the loss of Sevastopol and regarded the separation from the homeland as temporary. Kiev's disregard of the region exacerbated that impression.

The  Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate) rather than the Kyivan Patriarchate was the dominant church.

In the six years prior to the Russian annexation the American administration did nothing to prepare for what happened. During the 2012 debate with Romney the President Barack Obama laughed at the idea Russia posed any threat. He also promised then-Russian President Dmitry Medvedev ""more flexibility"" after the election. They believed him.

Of course throughout his entire campaign he also kept the alt-right close at hand and exploited Obama's African heritage as grounds to question his birth certificate, encouraged violence against black protesters at his rallies.

Your reply does it for me. In my state of California gay marriage bills have been defeated on every occasion (although I have voted in favor of them). It was made legal by a Federal judge not the will of the people. Therefore the argument can be made that gay marriage is offensive to most people. Therefore the contention that the KKK are offensive to most people becomes irrelevant. Therefore if the ACLU is successful in this case, all someone would have to do when the go to this black baker (just to be evil to him) is order a cake with the Grand Cyclops of the KKK on it...claim they were gay and therefore protected and watch with incredible glee as this black business owner has to submit...under the law...to decorate this Alt-Right guys cake with this heinous image on it.

"""Why didn’t Abraham Lincoln deport all blacks back to Africa; after all, they were definitely illegals, weren’t they?""

Actually Abraham Lincoln favored sending them back to Africa.   

""Lincoln first proclaimed an interest in colonization during his eulogy for Henry Clay in 1852, when he admitted his allegiance to the esteemed Kentuckian's dual creed of gradual emancipation coupled with colonization. If slavery could be eliminated and the slaves returned to ""their long-lost fatherland,"" claimed Lincoln, ""it will indeed be a glorious consummation.""

""When Douglas tried to portray Lincoln as the friend of the blacks, Lincoln countered, as he did in a speech at Peoria, Illinois, by denying that he saw blacks as equals and by advocating the colonization of freed slaves in Liberia. Lincoln was aware, however, of the practical difficulties of such a program: ""If they were all landed there [Liberia] in a day, they would all perish in the next ten days,"" he stated."""

"It appears the main effect of Motor Voter registration is to register more people who don't care enough to make even the minor effort needed to vote.

This makes sense. If a person is not motivated to take the simple steps needed to register as a voter on their own, they are far less likely to vote, even when our state makes that so easy with mail-in ballots. In states that still require voters to go to the polls, these folks would be even less likely to make the effort to vote.

When Republicans who want to require voter ID to avoid potential voting fraud are accused of suppressing minority voters, I don't believe it. Registering and voting requires only a minor effort, but  if a person doesn't care enough to do the first, they probably aren't going to care enough to do the second. The arguments for why anyone can't do these simple things are just silly, and according to some blacks, racist.

A few are there because they pose a serious threat to others.  Most are there because Americans still don't get it when it comes to respecting fellow humans.

Another mentally ill person of color armed only with a knife shot dead by armed-to-the-hilt cops...

If a mentally ill pregnant woman who weighs 100 pounds soaking wet can't be taken down by cops with tasers and sticks then those cops shouldn't be cops. 
 
How come this country is the only country in the world where our police shoot mentally ill people? There are hundreds of videos from around the world where smart strained police take down knife-wielding people w/o lethal force. It makes me ashamed to be an American."

"Trudeau is an wrong. I am an East Indian and One of the reasons I love and came to Canada is for its foreword thinking and allowing  me to live a better life.  My country did a stupid job of that. People come to this country to learn better ways of living and give their children a opportunity for  better lives. We know and they know that their   countries have messed it up. So then why, why do women want to lower themselves to cover up there faces when facing the world?  Why and what are they ashamed of, why don’t the offer there the courtesy of othersto see the when engaging in conversation?  Why live with rules that date black to ancient times. Are they afraid of there men still. Baffles my mind.   I am a male that came from that backward culture and these people make me wonder why the come here but live in the same stupid backwards world they wanted so desperately to leave."

"Today showcases how some liberals are the worst of the worst . Legislators boycotting a ceremony because they disagree with a person's position on issues is as low as it gets . John Lewis is the head dirtbag. He calls our president-elect a non-legitimate president.  When Trump fights back saying he ought to spend his time working harder on his home district that is hurting--poor John Lewis plays the victim . Typical liberal.   Though Trump won't do it , if i were him I'd look for payback and make a list of these poor losers and cut funding to their districts.  When Obama was asked about the boycott he could have called on these legislators to act as one America on this day--but true to form Obama sided with his black legislators and refused to comment. Today there is new hope for America . If Trump is able to do for America what he has done for himself and family---we will all become great again.  Just imagine an America with peace and prosperity for all.  Trump has a dream--our dream."
You couldn't pass a citizenship either. Talk about the pot calling the kettle black. (No racist.)
"Don't even go there. No sensible Canadian believes that this country is without racial prejudice (name one country that isn't), but we'd have to sink a long way before matching your violently divided nation -- the Civil War, the brutal Reconstruction, Scottsboro Boys, Emmett Till, Medgar Evers, the 4 little black girls in the Birmingham Baptist Church, the racist James Earl Ray assassinating M.L.King, on and on till today with bigots and trigger-happy cops shooting innocent blacks (some on video). And under your current bogus President, the revitalized KKK and Neo-Nazi groups who cheered his victory. Your little shots can't change history.

"Just off the top of my noggin'...

I would guess that the 9K+ initial cost is well worth the investment and will pay for themselves pretty quickly.

When you look at the next 20 years+ and the cost of elections. It seems to me that the biannual ritual has fits and requires single issue ballots, special elections etc., will be the true 'value'. The object of the game is make sure 100% of the voters has easy access to the information, and then at the ballot box. OK, I hear you...Not if you are on the red team...They prefer the opposite, nobody votes who is unworthy. Like, for example, ""low information voters"", women and black people and especially black women who is a ""low information voter"" are excluded.

Also, seems to me I recall the red team wanting to privatise the post office because it's losing money. Unpaid ballots are on the taxpayers tab. Over time we'd save money there too.

The yearly maintenance might even pay for itself.

I'm just tossing out ideas, no real information."
"""You are insinuating that he is a “traitor to his race”...""

No. I was stating [a fact] that Mr. Miranda shouldn't declare he is incapable of racism just because he [himself] is a Person of Color. He insists that it's ""not about racism"". But he wants to paint over a tribute mural to a murdered Black teen and replace it with business logos. Mr. Miranda says that he has been subjected to racial profiling his whole life. No doubt; the history of Puerto Ricans dealing with racial violence is long and extensive. That Puerto Rico is basically a stolen U.S. colony to this day testifies to this history.

But Mr. Miranda seems to have a lack of empathy for OTHERS who've also have a lifetime of experiencing systemic racism and violence. And that's not ok."

"“The idea that it should take more than a bare majority (of lawmakers) to raise taxes is a key part of the American identity,” he [Davis] said.

Oh good grief! Did the American identity begin with Howard Jarvis and Paul Gann of Southern California in 1978? That's when this nonsense of requiring super-majorities to raise taxes started. 

Why can't people on the right wing be honest? Must they always attempt to rewrite history, like when they claim the statues to the Confederate traitors weren't place during the Jim Crow era for the purpose of intimidating black citizens?

These proposals are nonsense on their faces. Corporations have seen their share of the tax burden shrink dramatically over the past quarter-century, and now they want to lock in their unfairly low payments. I hope my fellow citizens see through this game."

She gets invited to speak at a Cub Scout Den. 

11 year-old boy is manipulated by his parents to take her to task on her earlier comments about black people eating poorly.

"This incident is the last straw for me.  I have had it with the misogynistic, racist immaturity of Albertans that we are seeing - in particular Edmonton where we have men brazenly threaten Muslim women with a noose and men screaming racists slurs at Black journalists.

"The war on drugs is fueling the violence, and most of the targeted arrests are minorities. Statistically, all races except Asian Americans use these illegal substances at the same rate; however, the vast majority of drug prisoners, and victims of violence are African Americans and Latinos, yet, they make up a fraction of the population. Why?

We have a long way to go to untangle this mess: end the war on drugs, which is a war on minorities now!"
"It's heartening to read about focus being placed on the prison complex.  Now, if only the bishops were to pay attention and priests were to preach about it from pulpits, then maybe, just maybe, at some point in the future, Catholics might understand that what is going on with regard to imprisoning people of color is wrong."
Rural blacks carry a double yoke - the traditional leadership system and a lingering belief in the ANC. They need to reject both if they want a chance at a decent future for their children.

"Dale, the premise of your letter is so absurd that it appeals only to those of limited capacity to think and reason.  To you, Black lives clearly do NOT matter, which is the crux of the problem.  I am sick of watching cowardly police officers escalating situations and instead of trying to calm a situation down, quickly resorting to deadly force, often expressing enjoyment while doing so.   Your view is representative of ingrained racial fear and hatred, fueled by the belief that Mr. Obama is a secret Muslim born in Kenya, and that that racism was never a problem in America problem until Obama was elected.   Any intelligent person would be embarrassed and ashamed of publishing the views expressed in your letter.  Deplorable."

"OK.

You are saying that extreme black on black violence and carnage is not news for the MSM.

Is that correct?

Do you think that the left-wing mob and the utterly failure of the police to keep that mob away from the reprehensible neo-Nazis had something to do with the violence?

Did the MSM ever condemn left-wing groups -- e.g. Sanders' -- as supporting criminals like the one who shot several Republican congressman?  The MSM always groups those who respect Southern Heritage and are not associated with extremists with the rare, awful nut cases who commit atrocities, but the leftists who commit violent, racist acts get a pass from the MSM.

Is that too many subjects for you to handle at once?"

"Non-violence was practiced, as individuals, by black Americans in the Jim Crow South as a means of survival--to not fight back against the grave injustices they faced every day lest they be beaten or lynched.  That's why they already understood it and could practice it together to change history.  We need to respond to what is happening to our government today in which various aspects of social justice were built through the hard work of many people over a number of generations is now being rapidly disestablished through executive orders.  But the use of violent resistance will probably lead to the imposition of martial law and worse--Trump's vigilantes.  Instead we need to find ways to resist nonviolently that reestablish the community of We The People.

I believe the some of the race oppression issues exist. The black community is in a cycle the keeps them oppressed. I know people that have broken that cycle through hard work and determination to better themselves, but as a community as a whole, the are stuck in the environment they created.

If CK is serious about this, spend your money to help improve the education of the black communities. The way our system is setup, these schools get the least funding. This does need to be fixed. But remember, it comes down to choices. I know several black people that made the choice to do right and better themselves and they are extremely successful.

"why did the organizers of Pride Parade invite Black Lives Matter  to march in the first place ?
not only march but as honoured guests

the Parade is about Gay Pride and not Black Pride - that should be a separate Parade

the organizers are as much to blame

so why did Pride make BLM the honoured guests ?

play politics and got their fingers burned"
"“Do you want some grits?”

This comment has absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone's race.  The woman who reported this is completely mistaken in assuming that it is a comment which has any reflection whatsoever on one's race.  Grits are standard fare in the southern parts of the USA.  Grits are NOT eaten, as she seems to assume, only by African-Americans.  Grits are eaten by EVERYBODY.  To judge that a comment about grits is a racist comment is nothing less than profoundly a ignorant judgment.  To judge that speaking a phrase or a sentence with a 'southern accent' is a racist act is also nothing less than a profoundly ignorant judgment."

"Gary: Yes, of course. False flags work best when there is an ""obvious someone"" to blame other than the perpetrator. How did lynchings of Blacks get into this discussion?  That is murder.  As I understand it, no one has been physically injured by the recent rash of anti-semitic incidents. By the way, have you noticed that the NYPD thinks that the vast majority of the threats were made by a single person? ( https://worldisraelnews.com/one-man-behind-threats-us-jewish-institutions-investigators-say/ ). If confirmed, that will belittle the notion of a big wave of antisemitism. Also, if a single responsible perpetrator IS found, MAYBE his name and affiliations will be made public."

Football is destroying itself.  Not by the players who chose to protest against Blacks being slaughtered by our police but by the constant pursuit of profits by the NFL.  A football game is 60 minutes.  Longer if it goes into overtime.  But it takes generally now 3 + hours for a game to be completed.  Disgusting.  Soccker is so much better.  Less predictable too.
""" Trump has trouble with blacks because the media tells THE blacks that THE dems are better for them. ""
You seem to be suggesting that blacks are unable to figure out things for themselves and will believe whatever the media tells them. You should give them more credit. 

After all, they have seen the racist email chains. They have heard conservatives call Obama the food stamp president. They know that Republican legislators are trying to make it more difficult and time consuming to vote, and they also hear it when conservatives say that the only racists are those people who are drawing attention to racism."
"Top 10 racist Limbaugh quotes (continued)

[To an African American female caller]: “Take that bone out of your nose and call me back.”

“I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well.  They’re interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well.  I think there’s a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn’t deserve.” 

Limbaugh’s many attacks on Obama.....as a ‘halfrican American’, ‘Barack the Magic Negro’ 

“We need segregated buses… This is Obama’s America.”

“Obama’s entire economic program is reparations.”"
Many Blacks do not like the way the gay movement have moved in on their struggle.  I wouldn't know but I wouldn't presume to equate the two movements.
"irt Hilo.   After all what living in America having being a part of his acomplishments to this day he's still not satisfied with what he's gotten being an American, complaining having a foreign ""black"" taking away a ""black"" American role. Being of Black Heritage he'll always use that to complain, at times and instances I believe he has the right to do that. Reminds me of Michelle saying, for the first time in my Life... . Even if in a great position they'll always use that racial line of defense no matter what because of being on the short end of the stick racial wise. It's their escape and reason to complain. 

No need to complain ""only"" as a Black American Actor being shunned but should have said American Actors being shunned. Why use ""black"" race?"
"When flames are thrown, I throw them back, just like you do.  And those men are conservatives to me but Uncle Tom's to you.  And all blacks are tokens or prizes on the Democratic Plantation."
Thats because their knowledge if firearms is diddly. To them anything black is threatening. The ignorance is astounding if not pathetic.
"Wrong on so many levels.
The ""right"" to protest (or opine, or porpone, or express) is a right given by God and codefied in our Constitution.

Burning the flag, not standing up for the anthem, putting a crucifix in urine and labeling it as ""art"" while impetuously declaring ""free speech"" is NOT courageous, is NOT brave, is NOT impressive.

Never mind that the whole freaking starting point of their position - either inequality or #BLm or whatever (it changes weekly) - is flawed, non-truth, and just plain wrong.
To that, they add just plain dumb when they choose to be disrespectful in their ways.

"garycrum - Satoshi Kanazawa is a low IQ leftwing nutjob and racist.  That fully explains why you suckered for his biased research, thereby quantifying my hypothesis regarding Democrats.  

Your man Satoshi also publicly proclaimed that Black women are the least attractive group among all humans.    As a result, the largest student organization in London (representing 120,000 students) unanimously called for Kanazawa's dismissal from your London school.  His work has been roundly criticized and soundly debunked by his peers.

You got any rooms available for him to board at your place?  -  regards, 420.

"I'm for a Fermenting Revolution as opposed to fomenting revolution. Mmm! Rhubarb wine, black current port, raspberry sherry ... ""Raspberry Sherry"" would be a great handle for a crusading leftist-feminist troll. Bring on the revolution! Power to the peepholes!"
As an African American I am gleeful to have the choice of using Uber or Lyft as an alternative to cabs that has a pathetic history of not picking up people of color...
In the US there is an 800% greater risk of being shot by fellow Black dudes than by cops. Black gays have to decide for themselves whose protecting their best interests: BLM or general society of which cops are part. Most choose the latter but they are cast aside in the hysteria of the vocal radicles who claim to speak for everybody.
"A person has a right to protest on their own time and on their own dime. Call the customers racist bigots? Free speech doesn't extend to private concerns. The complete hypocrisy of the NLF Union is equally laughable and pathetic. The NFLPU doesn't support protests against domestic violence, CTE, fathering children out of wedlock, using PEDs, income inequality, or racist statements such as the ""Black Power"" salutes the NFL players so frequently provide. 

The lowest paid NFL rookie players ($465K) make 8 times the median household income in the U.S. In 2015, the median salary was $860K per year. Virtually every NFL player attended college on athletic scholarships. They have zero student loan debt. NFL players live a life of absolute privilege because ""privilege"" is based on economic power. NFL players insipid racism is reflected in their vitriolic hatred of the U.S. The very country that has bestowed so much prosperity, education, and opportunities they revile. Sound about right?"
"So gay lives don't matter to the black lives matter crowd? Seems rude to take attention away from the main event. And why would anyone want to honor someone who confronted police with a knife?

All that said, Seattle has many parades, as do many other faraway cities. Not sure why this one warrants RG attention."
"Remember the big muscular cop that worked at a school and threw a slightly built young black lady and her desk across the room? And for the horrible crime of refusing to hand over her cell phone! I had a lady, whom I used to admire; try to justify the violent assault on that child by that cop. I know damn well if it had happened to one of her grandchildren she would have moved heaven and earth to get that cop fired and punished. Yet, because the child assaulted was black, she it trying to excuse the behavior of that jerk in uniform. Yes America, we are full of racists! They are your friends, family, and co-workers! What are we going to do about it?"
I have no problem using the term domestic terrorist. How about you in regards to the same label for BLM and Antifa? Can you say illegal alien or radical islam?
"I would dare you to say that to a member of the former Black Watch.  After you pick up your teeth and swallow your words you'd find out what a real man is, it sure isn't hiding behind a screen name like some coward with a phony facebook account."
"I speak as a gat man yet the Globe censors my gay opinion. The fascists are on the left, using identity politics to silence all any questions about what is going on. The spirit of Ben Levin is still alive and well at the Ministry of Education, and the school boards: get them while they are young and malleable."
"Fair enough.. As one legend to another, have you actually thought it out on your own?  The individual right was also a myth to the black slaves at the time of our forefathers.  Not much foresight there."
"The National Anthem is now tied to Slavery, WTF is wrong with people.  It was in the PAST , yes the USA and every other country has a dark past.  Move into the 21st century and stop this victim mode, its does NOT help anyone especially the black youth. Teach history and learn from past mistakes.

Oh and the Democrats were the slave owners who did NOT want to stop this practice, until the Reps came along !"
These shootings must come to an end. Police will continue to approach situations with heightened vigilance and twitching nerves if people continue acting like violent miscreants. Black lives matter will roar when a police officer shoots someone but it is silence of the lambs when these criminals act out in such a manner.
"Maybe you didn't catch the news. Shopping centers all over America are closing up and being demolished. Too big to fail? The online stores are death to these malls. The world is changing before our own eyes. The future is here and with all its gory wars, higher prices, wacko weathers, shrinking medical coverages, hard to find living quarters, ruder people, tainted foodstuffs, uncontrolled immigration, radical religious battles, radical Muslims, pedophile Catholics, trade imbalances, black on black crimes, cops shooting blacks, nutty sex offenses, alcohol abuse and dangerous drugs out of control, and general deterioration of law and order. We are going to actually see our world collapse. We will have a front row view of all this. Hey, go buy your own papers."
"It's possible to disagree with someone without assuming they are on someone else's plantation.
It's possible to disagree with liberals without assuming that all liberals are in Jesse Jackson's pocket.
If black conservatives are fine examples of independent thinking, why aren't black liberals?"
"Dreyfus?

The drawn-out century-old French Dreyfus affair has little in common with overreactions to a professor's minor, if still regrettable, insensitive comment to a black student.

Unless you're making an odd comment about Richard or Julia."
"The 'epidemic of violence in black communities' is caused by the killers:  15-24 year-old black males defending their drug, protection and prostitution endeavors.

At least that's what the FBI and DOJ statistics show.

Black on Black deaths."
Trump did a better job of demonizing Hillary than she him. Large numbers of blacks and young people didn't bother to vote. As a result we lost environmental protection and will lose priceless pristine wilderness in the Arctic
"To sum up this 'essay' more of a rant, it says you must always defer to a black person's interests and accommodate them even if at a human level they are entitled, self serving, mean and even willing to throw you under the bus to get their way.  

And if you're not part of these so called marginalized groups, you must be very, very careful lest they use their mcarthyite tactics in order to shame you while absolving themselves of any responsibility.

Yes the rant writer is obviously intelligent and will be successful but to lament that she could not get further and it's everyone else's fault completely destroys any credibility she has.  

She's going back to academia now, where social justice and activism reigns supreme so she should be happier now, and she can come out and give PRO BONO legal advice forever to every activist group who asks when she graduates, because she's driven by things other than money right?"
"And what does McConnell say to the 30 million who cannot get healthcare? ""Well it works like this, we don't care about those people they are usually black, migrants, refugees, and low paid workers.  We have to make sure that the insurance companies make lots of money out of this and the top income bracket does not have to pay for anything.""  This is how capitalism works in America."
Where in god's name are you coming from? Under George Bush you had a war for WMD that was all about hot air and financial crisis that almost tanked the global financial system. Help me understand your perspective....Was it because he was black or he crossed the Rubicon and provided 20 Million more people with heart coverage? Please explain?
"Hockey is not a uniting force for the nation it was 30 years ago.
Number 1 watched sporting event in Canada is Super Bowl, number 2 World cup of soccer and number 3 the Euro cup. All three have nothing to do with Canada. 
GTA is more into basketball (people under 40) then hockey. Changing demographics blacks, chinese, Jews, Phippinos all watch basketball."
"Have made over 500 trips to the U.S. since the early 1970's. Been there for sports, vacations, business and just some local shopping . Back in the late 1990's I started to notice that if you had brown skin you got redirected at the Peace Bridge in Buffalo, New York. If the women worn a head scarf or dressed in a manner to suggest they were from a South Ssian country, the whole family got hauled in.
Crossing over at the Detroit border, I can't tell you the number of times young black men were ordered out of their cars and spread eagled over the hoods of their cars and frisked. 
Look, I'm not a fan of this behaviour but, it is their country and if they ask for your phone and you don't hand it over then you won't gain entry. 
Answer their questions, don't offer any extra information and make certain every one has their passport. Plus, have an itinerary or show your hotel reservations. Ans finally don't lie. Ever. Like Trump."
"Wolf Eagle, if you would have read the whole story, including the caption to the photograph of officer Jackson, 
""Baton Rouge police officer Montrell Jackson, who was killed in a shooting attack on July 17, 2016, is seen in a photograph from his social media account.""
you would have seen that officer Jackson was obviously black."
"These so-called ""patriot"" groups are armed and dangerous and are willing to shoot not only police but others who disagree with them over land use laws.  I want to protect the names of officers, who in the process of engaging this group, need the protection of anonymity.  This armed group of angry people are capable of attacking anyone as they target police officers.  This is different than releasing the name of an officer who shoots an unarmed black person, etc.  This is an organized group who is being funded by the likes of the Koch brothers on a mission to convert public lands to local control.  It is a bullying tactic. We even have people running for elected office on this platform."
"""You do know that he was a decorated member of the colonial army before becoming a turncoat, right?"" Um, yes.

The analogy ends there. The US government made a conscious decision to give amnesty & pardon those who fought for the south. Lee effectively ended the war by surrendering and kept it from restarting 2 years later by talking down those southerners who wanted to. He supported Johnson's plan for Reconstruction & became a symbol that aided its success. He was a productive, loyal member of American society the rest of his life.  He was neither pro-secession nor vehemently pro-slavery. He was a complex man (supported black education but not the right to vote); a product of his time. 

Where Arnold was ticked off at America & out for revenge, Lee fought the Union out of loyalty to his state, which democratically voted to secede. When he had the chance to bring the war to a close, he took it. Yes, he fought against his former country. But simplistic analysis of this man is impossible."
"Can you image the outrage if Republicans would have done this to Obama?  We were already being called racist because we didn't like the ""black Presidents"" policies or administration and it's decisions!"
Here we have another story proving that all lives don't matter in this country. Roof is a product of our society. It was easier for him to get a gun than a good education. We built that. We know there are innocent people on death row. We have never had equal protection under the law and justice for all. I would prefer that Roof spend the rest of his life sharing a prison with black inmates.
Canadian military is a cesspool of corruption and evil people and should be abolished and disbanded.  Canada should source it's military needs from the USA on a contract basis as it is needed.  This would be completely inline with POTUS Trumps new world order.   Canada doesn't really need a military anyway.  Move all the military personal to  current civilian police positions where needed everyone else can get jobs in the oil patch.
"NDZ is singing the RET tune, which is yet to fin resonance with ordinary black people. You look at her, you listen to her speak and the thought of having words like  ""My President"" is so ridiculous it is almost obscene. She is however backed by people who have everything to lose if she does not become the president, meaning that the ANC conference this time could end up with a lot of blood on the floor, both literally and metaphorically."
"Let me just settle that right now. I have never smoked pot, never used any drug of any type (save legally prescribed medicines from a doctor and liquor). I voted against the ban because marijuana is incorrectly scheduled by the DEA, the voters of this state have spoken, and by opening it up and taxing it we create revenue for our borough to provide important services. We also provide an avenue that will gradually, overtime, reduce and eliminate illicit sales.

The 1920s-1933 had tons of bootleggers selling alcohol from backroom speakeasies. Now that liquor is legal, the black market aspect is largely gone, and it's been brought into the light with enforcement, understanding and tax benefits."
"Mr. Porter: You're quite right.  Working class Anglos have much, much more in common with working class AfricanAmericans and working class Latinos than they have with Donald Trump and his friends.  Yet, as you say, folks who are ""down in the social pecking order"" often look for someone to place and keep  below them.....that's sad for everyone.  regards and thanks for your letter,  Gary"
"I have my doubts about the 'secret society', but lets say the rest of your post is true. That still does not disprove that tech is a meritocracy. If you want to talk about  systemic issues that are preventing women from achieving their full potential in tech I'm all ears, but saying that tech is not a meritocracy is saying that there are women who are elite and are still getting turned away at the door by the gatekeepers at Microsoft, Google etc. There is no proof that this is happening.

 Nobody doubts that black people have the ability to succeed at hockey. There are plenty of elite back players already (Subban, Igilna, Jones, Simmonds etc).
The reason why they are not in the NHL in greater numbers is lack of access/lack of interest. Not enough rinks in their communities, cost is high, they prefer football...whatever the case. They don't demand spots in the NHL simply because they have the potential to be good, because that's not how a meritocracy works."
"You're wasting your time. Hardcore western feminists and hardcore opponents to western feminism are basically two sides of the same irrational coin. You can't really convince either side anything that doesn't conform to their narrow view.

Most reasonable people would agree that, regardless of what's going on in the developed world, women are far from equal in Africa."
"Most European countries were dictatorships at one time or another. Germany was a pretty solid dictatorship. Italy, Spain,Portugal, Greece, Romania,Hungary, USSR, Poland, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia, Albania, Finland, etc were all dictatorships. The UK was not a real democracy till 1994, when its Hong Kong subjects were allowed to vote. The USA was not a real democracy till 1965, when blacks in the South could vote."
"""Are we to regress to Neanderthals? By their comments and treatment of others, some already have.""
===========
You did read the article, did you not? The idea that Neanderthals were. well, ""Neanderthals"" is changing. They were humans who may not have been as ""advanced"" as other human cultures but (according to the article) they were ""producing tools, jewelry and impressive cave creations. They cared for their sick and elderly. They perhaps even performed a primitive kind of dentistry.""
-
But while the ""Neanderthal-opinion of scientists"" of ""Neanderthals"" is slowly changing, their ""Neanderthal-opinion"" of ""Neanderthals"" as a ""sub-human species"" has not.....just as too many people today still think - and still consider - African Blacks/pygmies and Australian Aborigines to be ""sub-human.""

"SPLC reports over three hundred incidents, since the election, of violence or harassment directed against blacks, Muslims and members of the GBTLQ communities; and twenty against supporters of Trump."
"Interesting comment, Mole.  Last week, Black History week, the Montreal Gazette carried two stories in their weekend edition:   one about the travails of the historical treatment of blacks and another referring to this new stream of migrants as an ""underground railway"".

I was outraged by the Underground railway headline, particularly during Black History Week, as it seemed to mock the real suffering of blacks in North America."
The answer is no because he doesn't have a problem with Black America; he has a problem with people like the author who have an agenda to push and use race and identify politics to push it.
"Yeah, but what's a ""community""? You mean the LGBTQ community? The black community? The 55 Ford Owners community? Canada has entirely too many communities these days. They're not all equally worth caring about, especially when certain ""communities"" dominate the coverage every day. Diversity is NOT our strength!"
"I'm sure Steve's right about gerrrymandering by Democrats, (but not on this scale?)    Historically, if they cheat it's to involve more voters, not less.   Lower poll standards, driving people to polls, using unions to strong arm members to stay in rank with Democrats.   But they also provided voting rights denied to blacks for over a century and they did it in a territory that caused them great loss in voting.   The segregationist south, long held by Dixiecrats has moved steadily to Republicans.     At least the Democrats, even with their corrupted political proffesionals sought inclusion, not exclusions.

I'm a independent, but that doesn't mean that I don't look for differences in the two parties.  I will have no viable independent candidate, due in part to the machinations of both Democrats and Republicans to exclude any candidate outside of their tidy twosome, in a closed private primary system.   I'll cast a vote, but it doesn't look like I'll do it with enthusiasm."
"Trump has NOTHING to do with it. Talk about over reaching. Clinton was POTUS during OJ's murder trial, and the predominantly black jury let him off the hook. The Donald was hawking real estate back then, and as far as I know, has never had anything to do with Mr Simpson. Unless of course, Kato Kaelin was the 9th person in the room during Don Jr's meeting with ""the Russians""."
"Can't read? From the ""story"" you cited:

Obama on Friday morning strongly condemned the Dallas shootings, which happened at the end of a protest about the killings of two black men by police officers earlier this week, as a ""vicious, calculated and despicable attack.""

""Let's be clear there are no possible justifications for these attacks or any violence towards law enforcement,"" he said from Warsaw, Poland, where he is attending a NATO meeting."
"Outsider,

Venderbilt University just spent 1.2 million dollars to remove the word confederate from Confederate Memorial Hall.  I wonder if there wasn't a better use for the money, like maybe addressing black poverty?

"She might not ""deserve"" anybody's votes, but you are also voting for a lot of other outcomes besides just ""for"" a person, such as Supreme Court nominations, cabinet appointments, judicial appointments, how the DOJ, EPA, and other federal agencies are run, etc.  She also holds the veto pen assuming Republicans manage to keep hold of the Senate, the House, or both.

Your high and mighty ""principles"" aren't worth shit when you're dealing with the reality of a disjunctive choice between the two major party nominees in this election cycle.

It's also beyond condescending for you to tell black people who does and does not deserve their votes - I'm pretty sure black people are fully capable of figuring that out for themselves and voting accordingly."
"I care and so do many other folks who are opposed to discrimination of whole ""classes"" of our citizens, for whatever reason.  This was an organization formed as a later part of the Civil Rights movement...the founders are famous...for their work against the Klan...(a group strongly supporting Trump) 

And I very very clearly support efforts to protect these classes of our citizens....be they black,  Jewish, female, gay et al. Think God calls us to do it.

I am amazed that you are not supportive of such protections too....think it's at the essence of Christianity."
"You forgot a little item called the supremacy clause of the Constitution which gives the Federal law jurisdiction over the states or local governments-especially on issues like civil rights. Our entire system relies on the integrity of the voting system and the principle of one man, one vote. One miscast fraudulent vote can negate the vote of another lawful citizen and deprive folks of their equality of constitutional rights. 
After all, if the Federal government could not intervene in such issues, blacks would still deprived of their voting rights in the South. 
And if the fifty states were allowed to run their own elections without any oversight by the Justice Department we would have 50 little fiefdoms running sham elections and corrupt governments. 
Hmm...sort of like Hawaii government now that I think about it."
"When I consider the fact that the Saudi Wahhabi 'Islamists' have been at the root of much of the terrorism in the world - think 9/11 for a start - I find it supremely ironic that they are accusing the Qataris of supporting terrorism and extremism (not that I'm saying they aren't - they have a lot to answer for, for sure). And their disgraceful actions in Yemen make me feel even more that this is an 'extreme' case of the pot calling the kettle black!"

Those in the south fought for the Confederate States of AMERICA.  Ignorant people call the Battle Flag the ""Confederate Flag""...there were several Southern Armies, each with their own Battle Flag.  All of them Americans.  
As to blacks fighting for the south, I refer you to search Google:  Walter Williams, professor at George Mason University, Syndicated columnist and nationally known speaker.  Oh, yeah...he's black.  There are many sources describing blacks fighting for the South, including the likes of Horace Greeley.  You appear to be deficient in your historical knowledge of the War of the Rebellion."
"There are over 300 Million guns in the US and several trillion rounds of ammunition, few in the hands of leftists; if we on the right were planning something, you on the left would know about it very quickly.   We have maintained our discipline against the leftist astroturfed violence and the Soros/SEIU funded occupy and BLM movements; you're not dodging bullets - yet.   The apparatchiks of the Left manipulate the moochers and looters by appealing to their emotions and promising them free stuff,  and have them raise hell, loot, and burn in Democrat controlled areas because they know the cops are neutered.   There is no likelihood of Red on Blue violence as long as the left stays in their Blue cesspools; bring it to the suburbs and rural areas, and there will be blood."
"Key people who  know Trump  (Mulroney, Black)) as well as some of his Cabinet choices , say that they are well disposed towards Canada, and that their problems lie with Mexico which does not have the same standards as Canada . Neither has Canada moved US plants out of the US, nor invaded them with millions of immigrants, nor developed a large trade surplus.  
So I think that Canada should go its own way, let the Mexicans negotiate their issues , rather  that being lumped with them as a common enemy. Canada should also trade more with Mexico, but in a balanced fashion."

I can imagine the NCR of that day, it's just a grain of incense, go along to get along, the secular world is not all that bad!"
"Grisham is certainly correct in his message.  The celebration of Christ-mas is not about Santa and making sure that the economy of the business world ends the year in the black.  His efforts to remind the world of this is consistent with his chosen profession as a Pastor.

However his methods are what are troubling.  They are the same as the majority of TV Evangelists, which are to focus people on them and not the words in the Bible.  To go to a 'santa' line and hand out reminders about christmas or to even speak politely to the parents about their religious beliefs are a worthy activities for his ministry, but to openly confront parents and distress their children loudly in public is nothing but confrontational.  Jesus was only confrontational to the money changers in the temple.

No, Grisham is not Isaiah or a prophet, he is a celebrity wannabe doing his best to give true Christianity a bad rap.  The message is sound and truthful, his chosen methods and reasons are not."
"Statements only make sense in context. 

We know the context, i.e. ongoing debate about the title Master, and the status of the people involved. 

One academic made a comment to some students, referring to the title of a second academic, i.e. ""Master"", and pointing out the incongruity of the students sharing the table, as equals, as Fellows, with this academic Master, and how that actual, current status had nothing to do with some long ago disappeared ""slave master"". 

Perfectly normal academic banter about academic politics. It would have been the same wording had the students not been black. But being black, they chose to take offence, and that is what changed everything. 

Which again points out the irony that those who were once oppressed are now the ones with the power, undergraduates making respected academics tremble."
"For reasons unknown, you seem compelled insist that the idea of voluntarily resettling blacks was not all but abandoned by the time the Emancipation Proclamation was issued, and you disregard Fredrickson's book as well. What is the point of your hobby-horse? What do you think it proves? Lyndon Johnson no doubt held segregationist views much of his life, and Barry Goldwater changed his views on gays because of one of his own relatives. Staunch conservative South African F.W. deKlerk brokered the end of apartheid and ordered the end of South Africa's nuclear program.  Civilization and human progress are largely the result of humans' ability to change their minds, and in the end, Lincoln changed his."

"1/ I finally got around to reading that letter from the Seymour Institute. The black pastors make some good points, and I'm sympathetic to their dismay at the abortion rate in the black community but ultimately at odds with their paternalistic demand that Clinton present a solution specific to black women. Like the Catholic Church, the black church fails to persuade women to reject abortion and so turns to the government to coerce. As you know, I reject that approach.

The letter also features the standard conservative overreaction to Clinton's remarks about changing religious norms. These have been decontextualized from a speech concerning educational opportunities for girls (a point that has been made repeatedly in these threads and predictably greeted with crickets). It is simply histrionic to decry efforts to improve education and opportunities for girls and women as ""totalitarian."""

The majority of national security funding goes into the corporate military industrial complex especially since the Bush/Cheney debacle made private contracting a larger portion of all operations including the Black Ops/Spying apparatus.  All of this nonsense in the Arctic is just another profiteering adventure for contractors currently owning sole source funding.  Since Trump and Putin are buddies, they cancel out any Russian threat.  No other nation is any threat at all.  Meanwhile, slash all Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, Healthcare, Welfare, etc. in favor of more funding for ""national security"" Corporate Welfare.  Still disgusting."

"Here's my bottom line of the day:

    If these hundreds of thousands of marching women, along with the Democratic Party, the elitists at CNN, elitist leaders of African-American organizations, immigrant rights groups, leaders of the LGBTQ community, cared a bit less about maintaining their own upper middle class privileges and rights, more about the struggling masses of working folks, left, right and centre, they would not have supported the corrupt Hillary status quo but demanded that Bernie Sanders be the Democratic candidate for President.

""There’s his unrelenting rhetoric against outsiders taking American jobs"". Uh? That's the first job of a leader of a country to protect its citizens.

""there’s his immigration ban against Muslims"" ? What ban? 95% of the world's Muslims can still immigrate and visit US.

""there’s Haitians (who fear losing their asylum status) pouring into Canada"".? Obama applied TPS. Canada eliminated TPS in 2016 for Haitians. So now it's racist for Trump to do what Canada and Obama did?

"I expected something much better (and more rational) from a political science prof.

Praising his speech to Congress?  If reading a speech that someone else wrote from a teleprompter qualifies as ""effective"" I hate to think what it would the author regards as ineffective.  (BTW, didn't Trump and everyone else bitch about Obama's use of a teleprompter?)

""Some good Cabinet appointments...""??  Interesting that he avoided naming any - given that he'd just named Trump's security team that can't have been an unintentional oversight.  I have to interpret that omission as being an admission that he can't name any.

Trumpcare is worthy of an separate discussion but everything that we've seen so far is going to be a disaster for a huge chunk of the poor, including many (most?) of the 20 million that now have medical coverage due to Obamacare.

"""The USA would never let Hawai’i leave"" sounds like the outdated mindset that said Blacks would never be freed from slavery in the USA or that women or Blacks would never get the vote. The people who think ""never"" are those who forget that they, and other human beings, have free will and responsibility for creating a just society. While naysayers, who uphold the USA as the almighty continue kidding themselves, we, who remember that we the people have the power, continue to push for change and continue to make it happen."

The ""real time version"" is the honest truth.

No knife is seen.  No ""threat"" (other than the officer's) is heard.

You're the one ""picking another scenario,"" not Black Lives Matter.

The footage available seems edited.  We don't have footage from all of the body cameras.  Is it simply a coincidence that, out of the last twenty shootings of unarmed blacks, the only one officer fired and charged was the one caught dead to rights on third party video?

He claimed EXACTLY what these officers claim.  But the video shows him shooting a black man in the back and planting a taser next to the body.

Now, that's ""the real time version."""

"It is, indeed, vicious- and it is wildly misplaced and ignorant.  You say black Americans are done with innocent men and boys being murdered...?  Really?  In Chicago ALONE, 63 murders happened PER MONTH in 2016.  Guess who is pulling those triggers?

Here are a few facts which will hurt you for a moment... but if you open your head and turn from the leftist propaganda, this will help you understand the real problem.

**The FBI's crime data show that, in 2015, a police officer was 18.5 times more likely to be killed by a black male than an unarmed black male was to be killed by a police officer. Black males have made up 42 percent of all cop-killers over the last decade, though they are only 6 percent of the population.**

Here is one good article on it-- there are countless others.  You're wrong and that is the simple truth.  Please get educated... the real problem awaits your help in solving.

"Yeah, Zimmerman stalked the kid, followed Trey all over, who had every rghht to be there, as he lived right nearby where Trey was walking home. Ximmy wrongly accused the kid of being a criminal thug. Trey's only arrest, ever, was for possessing weed, no other stuff, not a gangster. Just a nice teen, a little high on weed, walking home from his prom. Zimmerman, by contrast, now has a long rap sheet of domestic violence, hit his bride, and busted for assault at nightclubs & elsewhere, very violent. He killed a black teen, only as a racist idiot, who thought he, Zimmy, was a neighborhood watch hero, which he was expelled from for his being a loose cannon. Too bad Trey defended himself, against big Z, otherwise he might have managed to stay alive, had he surrendered to this nutjob. It isn't fair that a high on weed teen who otherwise got good grades, had a nice girlfriend, and would have majored in something good in college gets killed by a psycho, now worshipped by far right racists."

"<Your comments are ludicrous.>
They are. But there was always a method to this filthy, racist madness:
1. Claim falsely that Obama was not born in the United States, demand that he produce a birth certificate -- forcing him either to comply with a bad-faith demand or allow the lie to fester; then challenge the birth certificate.
2. Claim falsely that Obama was a Muslim -- forcing him to deny that he was a Muslim with the awkward (and utterly false) implication that being a Muslim is somehow a bad thing.
3. Demand Obama's academic transcripts because after all a black man could not have gone to, still less done well at, Harvard Law School.
There are scarcely words (at least printable ones) to describe how despicable are the ideas this poster is pushing."
"The media accurately described Trump as a racist. How featherbrained are you, anyway? He supports Neo Nazis and Fred Trump, his Dad, was a KKK advocate.

"A dose of reality amidst the sea of mendacity fouling the political system courtesy of the phony religious idolators of invisible creatures dreamt up in mentally-deficient minds long ago and staining humanity ever since.  Imposing religious dogma on the population of this nation violates law and the Constitutional human rights of individuals over the man-made, false institutions yearning for gathering all under their black-souled webs.  The ranting of the religious ideologues in this forum demonstrates their willingness to saddle all others with their own inhuman views washed into their brains by the wealthy prelates of perfidity.   The same sources now ruling as dictators over the healthcare systems owned, operated, and profitted by the original christian lies.  Required reading:  Man Made God by Barbara G. Walker, exposing the lies and deceit creating the current religious terrorists roaming the world.  Time to end all religious exemptions and controls in commerce."
"Muslims and Liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America. Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures across the ME: in just one year Notre Dame in Paris has had three close call bomb threats. They even have Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. So few Muslims have ever come forward to denounce the sins committed by Muslims for islam."

"What? Puerto Rico has supplies coming in from Trump big time.  Apparently you only read this ""Fake News Paper"".

It's the venue that's objectionable. Most of us watch sports to get away from the everyday hassles and problems of our lives. We certainly don't need politics to be a part of the escape, and we don't need to be told by mega-millionaire athletes how ""awful"" our country is.
BTW, the majority, if not all are Black players. Not one of them have mentioned all the Blacks killing other Blacks all over the country in every city. Over 3,000 Blacks have been shot this year by other Blacks in Chicago alone.

"Nobody cared back then. All women paid their dues by tolerating unwanted sexual advances. They just don't have to anymore. We also don't send indigenous kids to residential schools, we don't import slave labour by way of unwanted children from London's east end to be worked to death and abused, we don't make blacks sit at the back of the bus and pay them less. All those things were considered acceptable at one time. Now they're not. Social media is letting everyone know it not ok anymore. It's called progress. It's a good thing."

"One more reference on this thing about ""religious liberty"", cake bakers, and gay marriage.

There is a very good article by Mark Reiff published in July in The Conversation here https://theconversation.com/a-philosopher-argues-why-no-one-has-the-right-to-refuse-services-to-lgbt-people-80365 .  He writes about liberties versus rights.  He outlines three kinds of liberty:  negative liberty, positive liberty, and republican liberty.  (The ""republican"" does not refer to the political party of that name but to the form of government we claim to have.)

Not all liberties are protected by rights.  Especially when one person's ""liberty"" infringes on the ""liberty"" of another.  And that is where republican liberty protects people against arbitrary treatment. ""the refusal of service to gay couples is itself an arbitrary act. It is an act of domination – just like refusal of service to black or Jewish people or inter-racial couples.""

Well worth the read."
"Statistics and facts are not your friend if you are into the all black deaths are because of the police, mindset.  

The FBI statistics in particular show who is actually killing the blacks.  

Their assertion that blacks are convicted more often just because they are black ignores how many blacks are repeat offenders and how often their crime victims are also black."
"Yes, there is historical evidence. The fewer people who vote, the more likely the Republicans are to win, especially when those denied are the disenfranchised (poor, Latino, Black,....)"
"And back in the day, blacks could have gone down the street to another school.  Or. they could simply have remained in the back of the bus.  After all, they were getting where they needed to go, right?  No harm done, right?  I think you totally miss the point of anti-discrimination laws."
"It doesn't really work to refer to the Declaration of Independence when you're talking to a black man. Charles Dalton's ancestors were excluded. They were property, with no unalienable rights. No right to liberty, no right to pursue happiness, not even a right to life.

You're saying the Constitution doesn't say anything about providing housing. True, but things change. We have a huge population now, with no more 40 acres and a mule available. Wealth is concentrated at the top, and poor people have no place to go. Taxing wealthy people is not a form of slavery. Only slavery is slavery."
"""I guess you could call actively working to weaken and undermine America"" Yes, Obama did his best to do just that and the willing left welcomed him with open arms as he attempted to destroy what America stands for.

He needs to be give a chance to make his own mark, time will tell if he is worse than the race baiting individual that was just displaced or if he can live up  to his promises. We gave Obama a chance, not for any proven abilities but BECAUSE he was black. It's time for common sense needs to prevail!"
"The judge was stopped because he matched the description of a guy people called the cops about because he was walking around the neighborhood with a crowbar (ie a potential robber).

What on earth is the matter with you? And what was that about winning a million dollars? Haha that made zero sense."
Do you have to ask?  Don't you think there are people who think the whole response to Colin K is because he is black?  That his inability to keep his starting job has nothing to do with anything?

"There are no Asians in Calgary in the theater, and none that would want to relocate for an Opera. The same thing happened in the 20's and 30's with black face. Couldn't find any black entertainers either.."
I agree with you.  Polls can not tell you how many people are actually going to vote.  One only has to compare the number of people at Trump's rally's to those of Clinton.  When Obama has to play the race card to get the black vote you know they are worried.
"The comments on this thread show the lack of understanding of and concern for racial issues in this community.

No, I said political OR OTHERWISE. How many times will that have to be said for you to grasp it? The government cannot compel ANY speech. Is that clear enough for you?

"What "" criminals "" have yelled racism to circumvent arrest ? From what I've seen the ones in the news couldn't yell anything because they were killed . Like Philando Castille for example ? Poor guy was pulled over for being black . The excuse the officer gave was total bs and he'd been pulled over for doing nothing another dozen times or so . But I guess he fits your description of a "" criminal "" . At least he has the right skin color apparently . 
  And funny how some people are so ""terribly offended"" by this protest all of a sudden . Players have been kneeling since last season and because Trump says something about it all of his followers are up in arms and they're "" boycotting "" the NFL . If they cared so damn much about disrespecting the flag then why didn't they walk away a long time ago ? It's because they really don't care about "" respect "" otherwise they'd demand their president show some once and a while ."
"More to the point: what are police 'floats' doing in any parade. I have been entertained by and enjoyed police motorcycle display teams, police bands and equestrian displays but floats seem a little over the top.

"Paul:  It wasn't very superficial at all.  First, these individuals' SSI was based on ""mental illness.""  I'm guessing you have some knowledge of how difficult it is to achieve eligibility for SSI.  It's a very long, arduous process and the individual must provide extensive evidence for approval.  Thus, an individual receiving it based on ""mental illness"" would have to have psychiatric history and statements from one (or more) psychitrist(s) attesting to the severity of the mental-illness.  Secondly, the ""money manager"" element is a REQUIREMENT imposed by the SS Administration for only the most severely mentally-ill.  This is a small, very disturbed group of individuals and the exclusion was actually very reasonable.

If we want to consider ""superficial"" status exclusions, let's address ""felons.""  Should a person convicted of tax evasion be just as excluded as someone convicted of armed robbery?

"Sadly Q HALL, the one to blame is the one accepting that they can't change this. I was glad to see much of the Black vote in the last election refrained from voting for Ms. Clinton, sadly most like Mr. Kaepernic didn't even turn out to vote at all. So today, other methods of bringing them back to the plantation are now being employed, ones that will surely increase the Democratic Party's hold on them.
Don't think slavery has been abolished, they just hid the chains and many don't even know they wear them. They call out others with labels, like racist simply because they disagree. But like Mr. Farrakan, maybe the racist has a point; we the people are the ones who give permission to government, not vise versa. We control the means of our own liberty, not government. Government today just keeps on growing, taking over more and more of the choices that belong to the people, and what do they sell to do so? We will give you a fish.

I also haven't heard or read that the BLM has as policy support of violence. Yes, I've seen it in marches they were in, but I'm not sure where the BLM stands related to that.  

I'm believe all lives matter.  I get the reason why black people are focused on their race, and that they want the focus on issues they believe directed towards them.  There are a myriad of reasons why that seems so.  I'd also like to see more ownership of their issues with law enforcement by them, too.  Sure, there is racism and bad cops, but that's not 100% the reason why there are so many problems between cops and officers.  We can sure play the victim very well, can't we?

"Good for you Looking for checking out the data.  If you've found the current population you know California is some 8% black, Washington 5% and Oregon 3%.  Cal is at about three million, Wash about a third of a million, and us just over 116,000.  Way up from 128  (0.24%) in 1860!

You ask: how did those blacks get here earlier  if it was against the law?   Good  question. The answer, the law was only casually enforced.  The law impacted but did not eliminate ""free Negroes"" coming here.  (think of our earlier Marijuana laws) Only Jacob Vanderpool was evicted while George Bush chose to move to Wash to be free of such laws..

As Nokes notes in ""Breaking Chains""  (good book you should read ) there were up to 50 slaves in Oregon, again in spite  of the anti-slavery laws.  Regarding the exclusion laws he states ""But while the exclusion laws were rarely enforced in Oregon, the tragic legacy of the laws  was that they discouraged blacks  from coming at all. (p 171)"
"Interesting post.

No feelings hurt...I am a Marine and I have been thrashed so hard you'd be tempted to call your Congressmen.

The reason I responded was to offer you (or someone else reading) some help on why civility and personally aimed barbs (such as yours) are not compatible. 

In the early 1970s, amid a lot of racism problems in the military...there was a black Air Force General who was part of a joint task force on the subject of race relations in the military.

He commented on the surprisingly low percentage of racial problems in the Marine Corps.  He said ""the Marine Corps doesn't have any race problems, because they treat everyone like they're black"". 

Thrash away, but it's not good for the soul."
I guess all the people who stood against slavery were interested only in dominating  and controlling Black families at the time as well.  I don't care what Trump's personal belief on abortion is as long as he backs up what he promised during the election.

That's exactly the same argument we heard 150 years ago when black soldiers wanted to fight.  It's the same argument they used against female soldiers 100 years ago.  It's the same argument we heard against gay soldiers 17 years ago.  It's old, it's tired and it's wrong.  I wish I was surprised by this obtuse, witless line of reasoning but Mr. Lamborn is a Colorado Springs republican and frankly I'm not."
You might ask Ken about all the screwed up projects he was involved in that cost the state billions - like calling the kettle black.
surprise surprise................... Conrad Black fans like the orange groper
"Just like in domestic abuse, so it is with Islamic terror, the victims blames themselves.  We brought it on ourselves, we had it coming, it could have been worse...  We in the West have supported some pretty sordid regimes in Latin America, Africa and Asia without attracting the psychopathic attention of this deeply troubled culture.

So, who's worse, those peddling the 'it's all our fault' narrative...or us for believing it?"
"Lets see, wasn't it coal miners that were so fond of the so called president? To ""help "" them he took away stream protection, maybe now they can get rid of all those silly safety regulations that really don't help, then Medicaid  so they can't get treatment for black lung. Yup back to a third world country, America is going to be so great again."
"We as a nation created a system to keep people down ?  Where did Schultz get this twisted logic from--Black Lives Matters ?  Thanks to living in America we all have a chance to be all we can be.  It's not our fault or responsibility if people choose  to waste their lives away. The only group who has hurt society is the democrats who work to create a class of people who expect government / taxpayers to pull their share of the load for them to buy their votes . Absent from Schultz story is the most basic human truth : we all have responsibility to ourselves for our own survival . Simply put, if you don't work , you shouldn't eat . Why doesn't Schultz even mention people helping themselves ?  If you go get a moose to feed your family , you don't owe the guy next door who sat on his lazy rear end half your moose. Everyone needs help sometime--but not all the time. Around 40 percent want everyone else to pay their share.  Those screaming about health care are the one's wanting it for free ."
"""Clearly aggravated""? Did we watch the same video? She was calm and didn't raise her voice at all. She wanted to know why she had been stopped and why her tags were run - completely normal response.

""We pull people over all the time just to check if cars are stolen"" is a weak excuse. If that's the truth, why didn't he just tell her that to begin with? And in any case, she's a well-dressed black woman in a nice car, it's obviously not stolen. If he didn't have the tool he needs to measure window tint, he shouldn't be eyeballing it - he should be fully equipped for his job and he should be carrying his card on him at all times. The issue here is that cops need very little reason to stop people and that's why racial profiling is such a problem. There needs to be more regulation and clearer protocol for traffic stops."
"I don't think they will make an US American be pope. 

I would be happy to see Cardinal Sarah ascend the chair of Peter...and Cardinal Kasper live long enough to kiss his ring after the despicable comments he made about African Catholics. 

I thought it was scandalous no one from the Ordinariates or Eastern rites where they have married men with families as priests seemed to have been asked to chime in at the Synod. 

I do think the contradictions inherent in the Kasper interpretation of AL will ultimately fall under the weight of their incoherence. Francis might go the rest of his life without answering, but the next pope will probably want to answer. God help us if they put in someone like Cardinal Tagle though!"
"Given Oregon's long history of racism I applaud anyone who works to overcome the lingering effects of that scourge upon our society, and Mark Harris has certainly had an innovative approach. 

 In a February 18th column he instructed his Eugene Weekly readers ""Negro History Week started as an internal Negro Community Celebration, remembering the birthday and the difference between Frederick Douglass (my personal favorite Republican) and Lincoln (my least favorite Republican who edges out Ben Carson and Donald Trump).""
Being an ardent  supporter of both Frederick Douglass and Abraham Lincoln as well as a staunch critic of both Donald Trump and Ben Carson, I found his proposition quite, well, uh, ""interesting.""  

While I don't agree with his Lincoln-Trump comparison, Mr. Harris is correct that there are reasons for, as well as against, a campus BRT.  The key is that it be handled by competent, objective professionals who are sensitive to both  issues of  academic free speech and racism."
"The only nonsense is your pure ideological servitude to Capitalism and all forms of slavery.  All of the U.S. bodies lie in very soil of the North American Continent where Native American and African men, women, and children were slaughtered by the first ""Capitalists"" invading.  You are so completely indoctrinated to the point of complete insanity wallowing in the same justifications the ""capitalists"" have used throughout history.  You and your type are the traitors to this nation and humanity throughout the world as your thirst for wealth and absolute obedience to your dictates reflect the same murderous terrorists of the past, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, Pol Pot, ad nauseum.  Blind faith in an inhuman ideology can only result in suffering for all, even the ""faithful"".  By the time you wake up, it will be too late like the Jews of Germany, the peasants of Russia, and all Native Americans.  Still Time for a Revolution."
"Talk about xenophobia and prejudice. Wow!!
Many cultures wear headscarves, beyond Muslims, including Native Canadians, Japanese, Turks, Eastern Europeans, Bangladeshis, Filipinos, Jews and Sikhs. African-Americans have long wrapped their hair, for example — think Nina Simone or Aretha Franklin.
Do you only take seriously someone who looks like you?  It's comforting living in an echo chamber, isn't i"
"I agree! on the background players at protests:  Martin Luther King, FD Roosevelt, Noam Chomsky, Fareer Kadar (? Sorry I'm tired)  So what is your point about  the woman being w/the WTO protest and then Ferguson.  One person is all you're pointing out.  Just one.  BTW?  We did that in the 1960's as well.  Women wanted to be able to have control over our bodies.  We wanted to be able to get Birth Control w/o being married, the Civil Rights Movement.  Our history man.  

You and find all kinds of reasons to resist change but Sir, it's time.  We have a problem.  Please.  Get out of our/their way if you can't understand how difficult their history was and continues because of folks simply hating the color of skin.  This.  Last line sums it all up.  You are not black.  If you can't find enough history .....Black History, then oh I don't know.  What's it matter.  I already told you we disagree and Sir we still do.  But you're nice.  Thank you!  L2g"
"Cherry is so out of touch with reality I wonder why news outlets even bother with him. Clearly he has no understanding of this at all.

Nobody - especially not the so called leader of the free word - called for Tebow's firing. What Cherry should be concerned about is why after this many years should african american people still have to go through this type of treatment in today's world. Please Don, just shut up cause you really don't get it do you."
"I agree. Problem is that we're not all so privileged that we get to ignore or even rationalize social injustice. Many of those black players have very real and legitimate concerns that, among many other things, their sons or brothers or cousins might actually get abused or even killed by an overzealous cop."
"I really like the quote: ""But he said the corrosive politics and us-against-them populism won’t be permanent"". Really? Democrats are against ""us-against-them"" populism? What a rich statement. Wasn't it Joe Biden who talked about putting Blacks back in chains? Didn't he say about a million times Trump was ""for the rich""? On and on. This article is laughable. It's time for Uncle Joe to enjoy retirement. Then again, maybe he'll follow Hillary's steps and convince himself that it's his turn to become President. In fact, go for it Joe...the Republicans and Independents will be rooting for you."
"Are you kidding me ?   Where's the guys and gals with all the anti-Trump names who comment on here ?  The million dollar question in all this is : why do they and many of you fight so hard against something that will help keep us safe in America ? Trumps ban was meant to keep us safe . What's wrong with that ?  Who's side are you on ?    People try to say this ban won't keep us safe , and that building a wall won't stop all the illegals----BUT , it will stop some of them, and that's a big help.  To all those who claimed this ban was anti-Muslim , ask yourselves--if that was the case , why didn't he ban the three largest Muslim countries ?  Average people--those of us who comment on here-- can disagree on issues and it's just open debate.  However , when people who are trained in the law like judges , intentionally make decisions simply because they want to resist Trump , make incorrect decisions--they should be removed from the courts. Liberal judges appear to want to destroy America ."
Make that Muslim women wearing niqabs. They are providing the target whether one likes it or not.
"yeah there is.  the properties he and his father owned basically did not rent to blacks.   I am not sure he is a racist, however I believe he is an opportunist and will use race and david duke to get ahead"
Do you think this characterizes La Muette and anti-Muslim groups? I believe that most of the people coming in over the border in Quebec are Haitian. Do you think the fact they are black might have something to do with the opposition?
"Last Sunday was Gold Star Mother's Day.

32 Broncos knelt during the National Anthem.

That was a disgusting middle finger to all those grieving mothers, and to anyone who loves their country.  Good luck NFL.  I hope you pay close attention to the damage you have brought on yourselves.

I will be fishing with my son during the game this Sunday."
"Once again point out the racism. Irish isn't a race. Nor is Roman Catholic or Muslim/ Islamic. That doesn't even take into account the massive differences in every facet of life from 165 years ago until now. No one in my immediate family was a conceived thought 165 years ago. That's like frican Americans demanding reparations for Slavery. First blacks themselves owned slaves. Secondly I never owned a slave and you never picked cotton. The past is the past. I could show non stop polls of Muslims who repeatedly, with majority, claim to hate the west. These countries also produce the largest number of terrorists. I don't want them here due to racism just
Plain common sense. You want us to adopt to Islamic shari'a law and have no respect for western culture then stay there. Pretty simple concept with no room for race."
"The 'antifa' in their black masks and black clothing and baseball bats?  Just like the ones we have seen in Portland and Seattle?

You, and many others who post here, have selective myopia."
"It's what Ward Churchill called ""the ideology of the ideal.""  Our language keeps us one or two steps removed from reality at all times.    It is the difference between observing and judging.  You are correct and the stories of the two young men are quite, quite different. But, the good man, the successful man, the one who came from an ordinary background, is the object of rage and outrage.   

Americans are trained from the moment they are born to value the idea of a thing more than the thing itself.  That is why it took more than 350 years for African Americans to break through the legal segregation and oppression that continued, despite our centuries of incessant intellectualizations about freedom and all men being equal.  We do not walk our talk, but we talk.  And I'm pretty certain that under our world ""leadership"" of past 65 years, what we have accomplished is to trash the planet so badly that nothing is long for this world. We don't like to look at that realistically, either."
"Mr Smith writes ""I suggest every racist be given a DNA test and shown where in the chain of humanity he is connected to all other humans.""  Of course that test would reflect commonality with AfricanAmericans as well as every other human being on the planet.  If you compare any two racial or ethnic groups you will find far, far more commonality than difference in physical make-up.  Racism and ethnic bias are learned and, somehow, we all need to work together to address and hopefully erase those racist and ethnic biased concepts.  Unfortunately, IMO, Mr. Trump's presidency has had exactly the opposite impact.  That's truly sad.  Gary Crum"
"Really?!?!? You had to go there?? Republican platform was to end slavery... Your point for me to want freedom??? Here is a point you may want to ponder, who was the first person to ""OWN"" a slave in America?? 
A black man, went to the highest court in the land and made his indentured servent into a life long slave. And that slave was also black. Not that ever implied my 2nd amendment thoughts and freedom to slavery. I bet you'll vote for any democrat for president"
"How wrong can you be? Christianity was widespread in the Sudan, by natural evangelism, not forced conversion by Europeans, in the 2C (recall the first ""militant"" Christianity occurred post-Constantine).

Christianity has almost as long a history in Africa, particularly east Africa, as it does in the M.E. There were entire Coptic Christian kingdoms for centuries. The only ""forcible conversions"" by ""outside invaders"" occurred when Arab religious imperialists exported Islam, at sword point, in the 7th century. Islam has been systematically oppressing and killing Christians, animists and other ""pagans, since then, with the West, for the most part, not helping them."
"Pluto, god of the underworld, or Disney dog, all created by humans to influence other humans.  The claims of long term jobs after these short term, out-of-state workers and equipment dig, bury, and pollute the landscape will be proven as false as the true foreign market intent of the contents.  North Dakota will continue to borrow from their state-owned, socialist bank to fund the massive military police might to keep all of these unarmed, unarmored terrorists in line.  Arrest and torture some more women, old men, and children to try to scare off everyone who defend their land, waters, and human rights.  A black stain on law enforcement, county, state government, and a national government too cowardly to stop it.  Maximum protections for the Texas-based Oil Billionaire black snake as it thrashes across the lands and waters for maximum greed.  Greed from oil neither needed for wanted in a nation awash in it."
"He was a sometimes homeless guy, addicted to marijuana and alcohol, exactly like Anthony Hammond, arrested for a similar attack in California. These are not  political nuts or terrorists, they are sick people that should have had treatment years ago. Both have arrest records going back to their youth, too. And, neither was a ""racist"". Hammond had a black girlfriend and bellowed racist remarks. The problem is a society that does not bother to help criminals before these tragedies happen. Treatment, education, jobs."
Black Lives Matter wouldn't allow him to attend a gay parade - they banned 'offensive'  uniformed police in Vancouver and Toronto.
"I am only against ordaining married men in the priesthood BEFORE ordaining women in general to the priesthood.  Celibacy does not promote the rights of women however allowing married men (therefore ALL men) to have ALL authority over ALL WOMEN does violate enormously the human dignity of all women as it is the example that all men are more sacred than all women.  

The Latin Rite, by not allowing MOST men to be ordained because most men are married or wish to marry, does not officially give an example of gender segregation as all of these men are segregated from sacramental leadership & authority & are therefore voiceless too. Not just women.  

As I have said previously, sometimes we sin by merely choosing evil or destructive priorities.  This sin is no less a sin than any other kind of sin.  

Yes, we were not ordaining women or married priests & should not have allowed the Ukrainian Church's priests to continue to marry unless we were going to ordain women and all married people..."
"How much FGM happens in the US? Meanwhile, male circumcision is still done here. 


And how prevalent is the only ""people of color"" thing that you claim?


It seems you want every problem everywhere solved before someone can point out that homophobia is still going on at churches."
"Groups like Black Lives Matter are the problem, not the solution."
"These comments selectively note & debunk, as needed, examples of written miscues. 1. ""...My Poor People’s Campaign sign is still with us, buried somewhere down in the basement."" 1.1. The piece's last sentence offers an exceptional point of departure for a more comprehensive treatment. 2. ""...Those of us who have named ourselves God’s chosen had better learn that our freedoms end where our neighbors’ begin,"" 2.1. This reference to American Exceptionalism too readily accepts its accuracy & more problematically the viability of its destructive zero sum game premise. 3. ""...We’ve made some progress. We elected our first black president. But institutional and social racism has crawled back like termites out of the walls. And racists blame the president. Strange,"" 3.1. Conversely, the 'Othering' of persons of color, & many other ostensible misfits has to be dealt with in an ethical manner. Otherwise the op-ed's melancholic lessons learned inventory would have been posited for naught."
Black market weed is half the cost and just as legal as anything sold once it's in my possession. The State is being greedy.
We have never had a black president.
"Great president? lol nope. He'll go down in history as America's first black, caretaker President. That's all. He doesn't have a legacy."
What have any living Republicans done for black folks? Lately the living Republicans have been trying to prevent black folks from voting.
"Racial abuse never occurs to an Asian, Latino or Caucasian LEO, does it? Especially in predominately black areas."
"Of course she finds it troubling. Comey can't let the first black President be brought down by a scandal such as this, so Granny Mao will be sacrificed in his stead. This is this century's Watergate."
"Now if only blacks and Hispanics could 'compete on merit alone'!

But they will need   Affirmative   Action forever."
"You are using too much lipstick on this pig.  Lincoln's own words as you and I have both quoted shows that Lincoln his primary sop to the negroes was ""the right to eat his bread which he has earned with his own hands without leave of any other man"".  He was not an abolitionist until it was politically possible and politically desirable in the middle of the Civil War."
"the nfl and team owners have not spoken out against kapernick's to protest racism by not standing for the national anthem.  he was not suspended by the SF 49ners nor did they ask him to refrain from doing it.  hence, this shows that they approve of the behavior.  so if the owners and nfl do not see anything wrong, then why should trump impose himself, it is none of his business.  the nfl is a private business and they can determine what they want to do.  the only reason trump intervened is because black players were involved, showing his racist attitude.  why do you think he did not immediately try to help Puerto rico - because most of the people are Hispanic or black.  he ignored them and their need for assistance for a week and a half and only when he was called out for his ignoring them, then he decided to do something.  trump is racist and bigot. it has been proven over and over again.  what is the non-literal meaning of SOB?  there is none."
"There's nothing saying that blacks have to patronize any business, so apparently that makes it okay by you for laws requiring them to ride in the back of the bus, eat at separate counters, etc."
I miss the good ol' days when a competent black man was President.
He wants Obama's black privilege and Hillary's ability to rig elections.
"Sam Clovis, Donald Trump's pick to be chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture, pushed unfounded theories about then-President Barack Obama's upbringing and called then-Attorney General Eric Holder a ""racist black,"" a CNN KFile review of Clovis's writings and radio broadcasts during 2012 and 2013 has found.

Clovis was a conservative radio host and political activist in Iowa before gaining national attention as one of the more vocal supporters of Trump during the presidential campaign. 

His nomination to head science at the USDA requires Senate confirmation.

Let's just see if Lisa votes to confirm a racist who is not a scientist to be Trump's head scientist at the Dept. of Agriculture.

Watching your next move Lisa."
"Again, this is why I did not like Kap kneeling during the National Anthem - it muddied his message.  I'm 100% for Kap's message (now people have no idea why an individual is kneeling - is it for Kap's message or is it to defy Trump or is it for Black power or is it for whatever), but I'm 100% against attaching his message to the flag that generations of ALL ethnicities have fought and literally died for to keep our flag flying for our country.  Kap's original message is so far on the back burner now...players have already changed their message for Black power and others are doing it to show their belief in the First Amendment (which is not the same message as Kap) and now tomorrow many others will be doing it because they are angry at Trump...so much for Kap's original message (never should have kneeled against the flag Kap if you really wanted your message about police brutality to get across).  How many more issues are going to be attached to protesting against the flag?"
Treating employees decently is better than harassing them because they're gay or black or muslim. Seems a reasonable principle.
"""Brown, an unarmed black teenager"" who had committed a strong arm robbery and attempted to take a police officer's firearm during a physical altercation.

Is it so hard to actually report the truth?"
"Exactly right, @alesia.  Ten or 15 years from now, when we have enough statistical evidence, my guess is you'll find that the majority of black women that had to use their weapon in self-defense had to use it against a black male, age 17-29. Will that finally force the black community to admit they have a cultural problem within?"
"Doesn't  everything count when you are trying to find someone. If you just wrote short and skinny there are still a few of those left but is giving hair color, eye color and pigment  not allowed. If you were a black teller talking to a black police man what words would you use? If the robbers were tall Swedes and talked like a Swede would you not put that in the description, it's getting crazy and so are the blogs."
"I think you misplaced your comment - if your comment is in fact a reaction to mine then please tell me where I said anything about anyone's color or skin.  My entire comment was about having a ""platform"" during their work time (which is while representing their NFL employer for which they are getting paid for).  Perhaps it is my mistake again in that when someone speaks of a ""platform"" this can only be talking about for black men.  Am I correct now T-bone?"
"Racism cannot be excused period. No one is that ignorant that they will allow racists to excuse themselves by applying the label of ""political correctness"" to any objection to their unacceptable behaviour. We know what racist bloggers are up to and Canadians will never let them get away with it. She used the N word in public to refer to a black woman who was complaining about racial discrimination at the York Region District School Board. When the trustee herself publicly engages in racist behaviour it is proof positive that the complainant is correct."
"really, and by what measure or events or policies do you conclude he was a racist?  Or are you just convicting him of governing while black?"
"Women, blacks, and Hispanic voting blocks alone will push Hillary over the top.  It's also about the next few Supreme Court appointments.

Yes, a lot of people will take the above ""fake headlines"" the wrong way....when the ""right way"" to understand them is that they point out the hypocrisy of ""the left"" to denounce murders across the board in a consistent and non-hypocritical way.....by ""politicizing murders"" by making what is ""right"" and what is ""wrong"" based mostly on ""if you are 'this color' of criminal/victim"" and/or ""of 'this occupation.'"""
"You just gave further proof that nobody knows what anyone is protesting for during the National Anthem.  One big mud pool.  Someone please attach signs to each protesting players so we know what each is protesting.  As for which message I support Kap that he was protesting during the National Anthem that I support is the Police brutality (and not just against Blacks, even though more Blacks are affected by the Police).  I am not supporting Kap regarding the U.S. govt issue - which was NOT what he knelt for (for clarification to those reading, this U.S. govt issue was when Kap was seen wearing a T-shirt with that message).  Regarding what he knelt for I am in support of (Police brutality)."
"""Black Muslims"" are most often different from mainstream Islam Muslims.  For example, in the Wikipedia article about Muhammad Ali (the boxer):  ""As a Muslim, Ali was initially affiliated with Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam (NOI) and advocated their black separatist ideology. He later disavowed the NOI, adhering initially to Sunni Islam and later to Sufism, and supporting racial integration, like his former mentor Malcolm X.""  ----- It might be the ""black separatist ideology"" part that concerns the border guards?"
"Yes, Trump is so correct on this matter.  Especially when he moans about the lack of hitting in football now.  

The game's just ruined for his watching pleasure when the athletes don't get concussions.

Might as well boycott - not the same game anymore.  Not to mention the scandal of black men not knowing their place.

Yes, sad old Trump is surely correct on everything.  As are you to try and make this about disrespecting policemen.  Just so correct.  Hope you don't get tired of all the winnin'"
"A different view of states rights and a different view of what role the Federal Government was to play in the young Republic , an Agrarian based society trying to evolve into modern society while union states in the Republic were using their newly minted industrial wealth to gain an unfair advantage. Its pretty easy to watch the biased news and the pop culture miniseries that feed the public what the creators want us to believe was reality, but it was far more complicated than we know. What of the Free Black Officers that fought on the Confederate side, what of the Black slave owner's what of those on the union side that were racist?"
I know what companies want. And they also don't want to pay taxes. And they also used to not want to hire blacks. Tell us more about what you know.
Was the man arrested Black? Just asking.
"Understood.  Like I said, I am far from convinced that if the KKK or whatever they want to call themselves, could get away with lynching, they would.  And for the sake of argument, who's to say when some black guy goes as a missing person down in the deep south, he didn't just get lost in the bayou."
"Sorry Bub, the Democrat party has a wickedly racist past. Name one slave-owner who was a Republican. Name one major city controlled by Democrats for the last 20 years that doesn't have an urban slum filled with poor black and/or Hispanic people."
"Why did so many black people boycott the 2016 election?  

Because neither candidate was Barack Obama.

Nah.. just saw the videos...your black ones suit you better though...
Never seen the 1980 movie Cruising and don’t plan to.  I am too scared to see Al Pacino in black leather as an undercover cop ‘cruising’ M&M’s gay bars and what might happen to him looking for a serial killer.   Still getting nightmares after seeing the movie The Crying Game.
The main point here you're avoiding here is the suspicion and disdain a black conservative deals with because of their beliefs.
Mormons didn't accept blacks into the church until 1978.  So Hatch lived the majority of his life as a racisit I doubt he's qualified to judge Trump as not a racist.
"How has religion truly benefited this planet.

Hamas used to supported by Iran now supported by Saudi. Some of Hamas leadership is based in Turkey.

Interesting: 4 Sunni Muslim Groups Responsible for 66% of All 17,958 Terror Killings in 2013. Wonder about last years stats - anyone out there

Western Europe trades with Iran, not same as friend. Saudi fund Bosnia, and Kosovo .

"It is no longer GAY Pride. We are merely hosts to a festival to which we are just spectators. The whole affair could now be moved to Exhibition grounds if ""pride"" is all there is. Will they ban drag if it offends feminists . Will they ban black leather if it offends vegans? I can't imagine BLM will give up domination of Pride without a fight, and certainly not to any group they do not approve of. They have stolen it and are not going to let it go. Next Year ought to be Police Pride to make up for the shame of this year's debacle."
"Oh I don't know.  Muslims are very afraid of us.  Illegals are afraid.  African Americans and mostly young children are being basically murdered all over this country.  It all started w/Trayvon.  If, as a woman, a car pulled over and two men jumped out.........started running at me aggressively..........w/o hesitation, I'd run.  Then they did it again: got out of the car and ran towards him.  I think he had every reason in the world to fear for his safety.  I'm certainly not proud of those stats at the end of the story.  Damn.  l2g"
"I apologize to offend you. I didn't imply Peruvians would use such words as 'Pinche'. My point was that racism in Peru is worse. I remember going to Peru a while back, and seeing indigenous and black people being denied entry to clubs in Lima, which you'll never see that in US in the present day. And I did say Latin American, in general. Not to mention Latin American people discriminate against each other. Peruvians (and all South American) feel they are superior to the lesser educated Mexicans and Central Americans. Mexicans are even racist against Central Americans. And lets not talk about Argentinians."
"She’s a person who made a mistake in judgment....Portraying Dr. Tweedy was fine,  wearing blackface to do so, was clearly not.  She has acknowledge her mistake and made what I feel is a sincere, heartfelt apology.  May I suggest few of us (likely none) have never made mistakes; have never said “wow, I’d like to take back that comment” or felt “geez, I should have known better than to have done that!”  We’re all imperfect, we all “screw up.” Ms. Shurtz is imperfect, she “screwed up.”  Those who are condemning her shout “Maybe it was foolish, but she should have know better!” They need to a) remember, doing something you should have “known better” than to do is the very definition of a foolish act, b) ask themselves if they’ve ever been foolish and, importantly, c) remember if they sought (and hopefully received) forgiveness for their foolish act."

One group is not specifically mentioned:- those children who were raped by clergy and whose crimes were covered up and enabled by their hierarchy over many decades.

 Where were the Catholic bishops then in "" ...  exercising prophetic leadership in opposing the massive ... "" crimes of their clerics?

Words have little meaning; it is by their actions they will be judged. That is true prophetic leadership."
"This article needed editing.  If he weren't a bishop would he be allowed to ramble with self serving points? 
He laments the museum's lack of RCC presence.  The RCC was insignificant in lives of black persons. If anything, the violent hostility against blacks by Irish Catholics especially in NYC and Memphis are examples.  N The RCC didn't rush to the South after slavery like Protestant churches to offer social assistance.
Encouraging people to visit a museum is safe.  As a bishop & black man he asserts no leadership in the more controversial arena of parish life - engaging RCs in exorcising bias against blacks.  Coming from the Southside of Chicago, too, I was sharply aware of the intense prejudice against blacks. MLK said of his experience in this solidly Catholic environment: ""I have never seen, even in Mississippi and Alabama, mobs as hateful as I've seen here in Chicago."" This slice of RC presence should be in the museum. RCs were a minor note, at best, in healing & reconciliation."
"Sigh. You were happily stating ""facts"" earlier but have yet to acknowledge that you were wrong and that both children were indeed, little girls - and his was a much older and much bigger girl. 

Most of your ""facts"" from earlier, are in actual fact, total and utter crap, and I'm afraid they paint you as racist and misogonistic. You can respond, but I will no longer raise my blood pressure by engaging with a person who cant tell right from wrong, and feels a man is justified in behaving like Nico Viljoen did because a woman ""may have"" sworn at him. I sincerely hope you are single and childless. 

Good day Le Negra. Blessings be upon you."

""Since Donald Trump won the Presidential election, there has been a dramatic uptick in incidents of racist and xenophobic harassment across the country. The Southern Poverty Law Center has reported that there were four hundred and thirty-seven incidents of intimidation between the election, on November 8th, and November 14th, targeting blacks and other people of color, Muslims, immigrants, the L.G.B.T. community, and women.""

"Using violence or vulgar language, angry rants...Ted ""Ten fingers of doom"" Nugent said he'd kill Obama. ""Uncle Ted"" got a visit from the 'men in black'. The sad part is that nobody saw it as unusual. 

People are people. They have faults, weaknesses and strengths. Anyone stoking hate isn't a one man band. They want everyone to join his/her cause. Those who don't,are labeled the enemy or worse.

Drumpf will pay your legal fees if you punch the press and/or a liberal with a sign Drumpf doesn't like. A reporter got bodyslammed by the politician in his district asking a civil question. The reason? The politician heard that same question one too many times. That Grimm guy threatened the puniest man on the plant w/ ""I'll break you like a boy."" Every Drumpf rally, media hatred was stoked and encouraged. At every rally!

""The Anglo Saxons are not sending their best. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people.”""

This needs to stop!"
"Without a doubt, Obama is the most despicable president in American history. He has set back race relations some 75 years, and released over 1000+ prisoners so far, mostly black, to prey on the law abiding citizens after he is gone from office. You know that many of them will not be good citizens."
"Planned Parenthood is conducting murder in order to balance racial diversity. Something on the same level as the holocost. Then they turn around and sell the poor childs body parts on the black market.  We certainly do not want the Democrat Party educating our children about anything. Our young people are scared to death of being charged with sexual assault for nothing more than breaking up with a girl they had consensual sex with. All the while priests and politicians, and law enforcement are molesting children and getting their sentences commuted because they hold status in society. These bills have noting to do with justice as their titles suggest, they simply forge a new method for obtaining power and intimidation over the citizens of this great country. What we need are term limits, new politicians, and a renewed respect for liberty of the innocent until proven guilty.  We do not need new ways to imprison the citizen, but new ways for the citizens to convict corrupt politicians."
"Why are you surprised that the response to murderous authoritarianism is violence? The Democrats are very law and order, much as it doesn't fit your narrative - they're within the current system of authority and power and want to perpetuate their place in it. If you want less violence on the streets the best method would be for the police to stop shooting black people - vigilante cops make for good action movies and bad cities."
"We all acknowledge skin color.   It makes a difference today, it most certainly made a difference in Unthanks world.    We can pass law to prevent discrimination, but no law controls the human reaction to what we see and the emotional reactions that follow.

In the most polite of terms, your saying racial discrimination toward blacks could have been stopped by everyone agreeing to be 'color blind' belittles the suffering of generations of black American families throughout our history.    The effects of both legal and illegal discrimination against black Americans, for many generations, continues to shape our nation today.    

We will never be a color blind nation.  We can be a more equitable society that doesn't let our bias affect the equal application of our civil rights."
"Mr. Pitts didn't cover half of what women have to endure in this country. I read about a black woman who had to move because someone(s) wrote the n word all over her house and yard. Another black woman had to move because someone soak her porch in gasoline and she feared for her life. A Jewish woman reporter wrote an article about Melania, and was threatened with rape and murder. Her five year old daughter was also threatened with rape! Then you can go to a trump rally and see shirts that say ""trump that b***h"". Then there's Roger Stone who formed a group against Clinton with the acronym C**T. It goes a lot deeper than being called ladies."
"1966 51 YEARS AGO, PREP SCHOOL HAD BLACK STUDENTS AND NOT ONE PROBLEM, NOW WITH TRUMP IN CHARGE ITS OPEN SEASON."
"I am NOT saying we do not have a race problem in some police departments, but, when looking for problem police departments, are we only looking at crimes perpetuated against black people by the police or against all races by the police?  Honestly curious."
"So Trump brought up perfectly valid issues, and many jumped on it. 

And Cruz got pretty far in the Republican race, despite being part Cuban. So i fail to see your point.

If Bush's team in fact did that, it was indeed disgusting tactics. But having a ""love child"" at all might have been more important to a conservative electorate than it being black. Otherwise, would not the fact he had adopted a Bangladeshi child be just as much of a turn-off?"
"It began with what?  Shootings of unarmed black men?  Oh, I think it started before then.  I think it all started with the race baiting.  As to those ""unarmed"" black men, if the author is referring to Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown, then Rhina Guidos needs to do her homework.  Unarmed does not mean non-violent, and in each of these cases the shooters were vindicated by factual evidence; the kind of evidence ignored by race hustlers to foment racial division.  If you ignore the facts to do just that, then you, Ma'am, are the racist."
"The real issue, is the overdevelopment of the Waikiki district, and the overpopulation of the Waikiki district.

The infrastructure of the Waikiki district, in the 1960s, was never designed to handle the sewage & waste, that has been generated in 2017.

Hypothetically speaking only, if 1 million people flushed their toilets, all at the same time, the sewage pipes would explode, and all of the ocean water near the shoreline, would be brown to black in toxic waste.

The fixing of the Ala Wai canal, will not be looking 100 years into the future.

It will only be a temporary fix, for a temporary disaster, just like the RAIL."
"To be fair, Democrats play the race card every day, on every network, every single year. They have to. Their record of achievement with African-American voters - on poverty, on black-on-black crime, on education, on wages, on the unprecedented number of African-Americans on Food Stamps - is abysmal. As liberal black TV host Tavis Smiley said on HuffPost Live, “Sadly — and it pains me to say this — over the last decade, black folk, in the era of Obama, have lost ground in every major economic category.”


Anytime this record of non-accomplishment is raised, Democrats have a predictable response: the GOP blocked us. Their favorite line of late has been that “Obama inherited the Great Recession from George W. Bush.” This is known as The Bush Card, which is also used to explain ISIS, the growing debt and deficit, and more."
"No lady, this is a black problem but your blind political correctness will not allow you to see it.  You know it, you just absolutely refuse to acknowledge it.  Our politicians and media are much too cowardly to acknowledge it so once again we will be forced to go down some insane road that has no chance of success."

Sighs and oh it's not a racist organization because they have 1 black member. Face palm. 

Just the most ridiculous story I've read all day.  No one is coming for your guns.  If anything it would be easier to napalm you than for the govt to want to send anyone in for your guns (realistically speaking) and no muslims are going to hop out of the woods shooting folks, geez."

Pennsylvania.  ""She won Pittsburgh and Philadelphia by the margins anticipated but there were almost 100,000 fewer voters than four years ago.""

""Clinton’s black voter turnout dropped more than 11 percent compared to 2012. Even among those who showed up, the support for Clinton among active black voters was s 87 percent but Obama had 93 percent. Almost two million black votes cast for Obama in 2012 did not turn out for Clinton.""

"The census data for 2014 reveals that 3.9% of Alaska's population is ""black alone.""  It also reveals that 7.1% reported ""two or more races.""  Of the dual race respondents 4.3% reported as black. But now we have the slippery slope of how much of a particular race must one be to report a dual race profile?  But more importantly the article lacks information about the racial profiles of candidates for judge vacancies.  Isn’t that important in deciding if there really is a problem or simply a lack of qualified minority candidates?"

"The point you are missing James007 is that the mass immigration that has been championed into Canada the past several decades has been politically and ideological in concept. It is not need that has championed this constant mass inflow but rather the formation of ethnic entities that serve as voting blocks in the future for political parties in power. This is precisely why Liberals want a constant flow of Muslim migrants to form additional and larger ethnic enclaves in major cities to do what they do best. And that is to stay together, stay non assimilated and dutifully vote for the party that let them in.  Trudeau changing citizenship requirements to three years residency is all about the vote. Shake your head once and then shake your head again. Reality is what it is. The result has been the mass formation of disparate and isolated ethnic enclaves with no relevance to one another or a cohesive nation. That is our future according to Liberals. Are you liking it better now?"

"As for the Conference battle flag, that wasn't racist until obama made it racist.

"Unilever could, if they cared to, learn several lessons from this fiasco. One, know who your consumers are. I had so many people on my social media newsfeeds, women of color, announcing that they were so disappointed they refused to use Dove products any more that I lost count. Another is to have some diversity on your advertising staff. Anyone with half a brain in their head would have questioned this before they published it. Also, having competent people on your advertising team would make a tremendous difference."
"It certainly makes sense for Ms. Knight to insist people identify her as black, by virtue of her mother's origin.  That way, she gets to claim the many benefits and entitlements of victimhood.  If Ms. Knight were identified as South Asian - not entirely unreasonably since that's her father's origin - she'd be just another un-special person who would have to make her way in the world based on merit."
"Heres an Idea.  Why don't the broncos spend their game plan working on how to best protest on the sidelines.  It worked out really well for the Raiders, Steelers and Broncos last week.  How about something even more exotic. Lets be sure to practice all those special end zone dances on the occassional chance you actually score a TD.  Sad.  Our country is so divided and now the one thing that gives us a ray of hope is being riped apart by a bunch of millionaire NFL players who think that the Police actually lay awake at night trying to figure out how to kill more black men.

But hey.  I say go for it.  Lets really make a stand.  Lets just not play the game. Lets show America.  Cancel the NFL.  I wont miss it."
"Imagine if ""taking the knee and bowing one's head"" actually ""unites"" the following people and groups in their ""displeasure"" with some aspect of the United States (for different reasons of course):
(1) Blacks because of police brutality/shootings.
(2) The Liberal Left because of their hatred of Trump.
(3) Southern Confederates because of the loss of the Confederate States.
(4) Religious Conservatives because of abortion, same-sex marriage, etc.
(5) Native Americans because of war, conquest, and broken treaties.
(6) Native Hawaiians because their sovereign nation was stolen from them.
(7) Any and every other person/group for other reasons.

As anyone can see, there are lots of reasons for lots of people to ""kneel on bended knee and bow one's head"" if they choose to do so.....in a way that ""traditionally"" has been used to show one's reverence to God."
"Chips aside, how would the writer change the culture that she feels victimized by? We've heard about what she doesn't like but she doesn't appear to offer any idea of how her workplace could be changed to enable her to 'fit in'. My sense is that in a law firm that was composed entirely of female persons of colour many of the issues she has raised would still be issues."
"""Our vantage point shows that the ANC has added millions of black people into the upper-middle class and that these people are now failing to identify with the ANC due to our distance and mistakes in the main but also due to our inability to mobilise them to the fact that the struggle is not over and the gains must be guarded through unity.""

Or perhaps their social elevation has exposed the inherently decent nature of these people to a broader range of viewpoints and open debate, leading to a Damascene moment.

As a movement fighting to end apartheid, the ANC could claim a right to the loyalty of the black people it was seeking to enfranchise.  As a governing party the rules are different and the ANC's inability to walk the walk means that heads are starting to rule hearts within its traditional support base.  References to its pantheon of past leaders won't help either as the inevitable comparison is not flattering to the moral and intellectual pigmies that dominate the ANC today."
"The penultimate sports ""fake news""/propaganda piece about the sexist and misogynist Cam Newton. Dannon Yogurt dropped the Camster because he's toxic and his views are toxic. Camster puts up the ""Black Power"" salute during games and degrades females. So aside from the Camster being openly racist in the workplace and with paying customers, he's a geez whiz, golly gee swell guy?? MVP. Chiefs QB Alex Smith has 11 TDs and zero picks to date and QB rating of 125.8. Newton's current numbers are comparable to Rams QB Jared Goff."
"Mr. Twyford: I think it is eminently clear from all accounts that the Dallas shootings were racially motivated.  No onem, to my knowledge, as suggested otherwise. The shooter made that quite clear in all his comments.  It seems, in his mind, his response to the several recent killings of African American men by police, was ""appropriate.""  Of course it wasn't....no one would argue otherwise.  His was a heinous crime just as the other mass shootings have been.  

We could debate the many shootings of Black men by police officers.  Justified? Accidental? ...the result of a chain of ""unfortunate"" events and circumstances? Intentional and racially motivated? The result of the ever-increasing fear and distrust between the Black community and police officers?  Each incident is different and each of us will see each of those incidents differently.  

Our choice of how we address these tragedies can, in a small way, help de-escalate or escalate the violence... what does yours do?"
"This is good! Now a dialogue can start between Toronto police,  BLM, and the LGBTQ community to resolve the conflict between these groups. The police and the LGBTQ community have come to a better understanding over the years now the LGBTQ and police need to work at being more inclusive of minorities and work on eliminating the racism that is so prevalent.

This is only a starting position for resolving differences. The Toronto Police will be in the march again after a year or two."
"They have also simply played bad baseball. Walking two batters in the same inning, both of whom score, throwing error allowing another run, that's 3 of the 4 runs Atlanta scored. Add in the constant inability to get runners in from third with less than 2 outs, just bad baseball. I also think Black has to take some credit, with the offense struggling, there have been several situations that were just screaming bunt, Black lets them swing away, EVERY time has resulted in a strikeout, pop up, or ground ball double play. The other day the root guys were fawning over Black for inserting Valaika, who went 3 for 3, just showed me the error of continuing to send Story out there day after day."
"Seriously? Re the kneeling and why. Here I thought it was about blacks and police, or social injustices...

Well call me silly- the article subtitle spell it out quite clearly- ""The protests spread this season after the former San Francisco 49er [Kaepernick] was unable to sign on with another""

To that I state: kneel away gentlemen. I won't be watching any longer. Nor watching any TV ads either."
"Alan, I did not read where this guy's ethnicity was mentioned. From an outside observers point of view, your bringing this up does actually speak volumes about your own biases though.

As for terror, it's not the color, it's the intent. Yelling Allah Akbar let's everyone know he is doing this in the name of Islam. That is where we get the terrorism...it was his intent.

Another example of a mass killing is Dylann Roof in South Carolina. Was he a terrorist? No. He is a racist and killed because those folks were black.

While it's not always obvious what is and is not terrorism (the motive for the Vegas shooting is still unknown), sometimes it is. In this case, it seems rather clear."
"The Canadian Jewish Congress and others were attacking a number of things: freedom of speech, legal rights and common decency.

The event was a memorial for Barbara Kulaszka, who passed away a month ago. As a lawyer she defended some far-right Canadians on free speech matters. As far as I know, her views and speech have never been at issue. By attempting to shut down this memorial, its critics aren't attacking hate speech, they're attacking someone's ability to speak about a deceased person. The critics are likewise attacking the legal right to be represented by a lawyer, because the condemnation has a chilling effect on the ability of an accused to get legal representation. And then finally, the critics are attacking common decency. It was a memorial, not a neo-Nazi Holocaust-denying free for all.

Like it or not, Ms. Kulaszka defended free speech and individuals other lawyers wouldn't touch. The CJC et al acted poorly in trying to stop her memorial."
"IF Trump does just half of what he talked about doing , America will be well on the road to recovery . At least we now have hope .  You can bet the ranch Trump won't be telling the nation "" police acted stupidly "" like Obama did , painting all police across our nation as bad and always out to get people of color.   If we make a mistake and drink the real Coke vs the Diet Coke , it's no big deal . However , if we make the mistake of believing we are an atheist , we are doomed.  Because I care about all people , including you ,  if I may suggest , check out the paperback book How Can I Know by Robert Jeffress . It's an easy short read . It will give you wisdom that really matters in this turned upside down world.  You'll thank me for it ."
"“Zuma, it’s because of you and your incapable government that we haven’t been able to redistribute land.” There's actually a lot of truth to that. If the state had been judicious in buying agricultural land as it came onto market and distributed effectively, the black farming class would be magnitudes larger than it is now. That's to say nothing of the urban land it owns that's been sitting unused for decades. 

""This country will not, apparently, be saved by women. They are nowhere to be seen in the opposition"" -- Slightly odd given the amount of focus Phumzile van Damme got in the article. And the hero IFP MPs who exposed Sassa? The women are there, you just have to see them."
"Imagine if you well, please it is not hard if you try. Say the folks walking down the street the wrong way were trump supporters and a black man was in the suv, are you seeing this in your mind, try to open it up, and the events unfolded exactly the same way. How many of you here that put the blame on Sparhawk, at least some if not all, would feel the same about it being a black man, or in fact about anyone who had a HRC flag on their vehicle? Be honest with yourselves, there are those here who would completely change their stance and blame just the Trump supporters. These same people will refuse to acknowledge the hypocrisy of there positions. Are you listening icon, how about you eric? Dejain, becca you here? Can you  disagree with what I just wrote?"
"Good grief Ms. Public Editor. Here it is, Mon. morning, Aug. 21st, the next day after a clash Quebec police had with black masked alt-left, illegal counter-protests, our Prime Minister labels the legal protesters blocked from protesting as racists, Canadians who are legally protesting illegal immigration and radical Islam, and the G&M buries their coverage of the event by not placing any links to it on G&M cover page. Sure, fake news and the manipulation of the news doesn't exist at the G&M. I'm sure most liberals believe you."
"By golly you're right. I mean, there is no way any kid could form opinions or ask questions about anything political. It MUST be part of a conspiracy! Has to be part of the liberal agenda to defame any Repub amirite?

It's always part of the ""agenda"" for conservatives, or so it seems. The gay agenda. The black lives matter agenda. The illegal immigrant agenda. Apparently, everything conservatives don't like is being masterminded by some evil force, likely George Soros. 

Even kids can read about something and formulate questions all on their own."
"It is not Shakespeare or no Shakespeare scenario in Ontario. What it is happening is rather than students maybe reading 4 Shakespeare plays over their high school career, they will now read 2 plays and then read other material.

In the senior grades, English students are often given the choice of reading 1 of 10 or 12 books available in the department.  This could include other iconic writers such as Dickens or Harper Lee or it may include more recently acclaimed writers who represent diversity.   I am aware of schools in less diverse parts of the province than Peel that are reading The Book of Negroes or Three Day Road or No Great Mischief etc.  

These are all good books that will still allow students to learn the main principles of reading and writing and thinking about issues in the world.

It is Shakespeare plus many other writers that provide students some choice on what they read."
"Those Southern Democrats are all dead, Who.  Either they switched parties or left office.  There are no more Dixiecrats or Southern Democrats in US Congress.  Not one.  The Republican Party of anti-slavery existed for a few short years, before and after the Civil War.  That was 150 years ago.  In 1964, four out of five congrsssional Republicans voted for the Civil Rights Act.  Then came Lee Atwater with his Southern Strategy, which elected Reagan to office by appealing to Southern Racism, and that has been the implicit winning strategy of the GOP ever since, until, with Trump, it became an explicit strategy.  And you think African-Americans should vote Republican? That is an insult to the intelligence of our African-American voting citizens."
"My wife IS African-American so I've been blessed to have been able to attend a number of African-American parishes with great ""Gospel"" Masses and they are terrific and my favorite.

"Shall we bring down statues of Mahatma Gandhi because of his attitudes towards black people or because he addressed Hitler as ""friend"" in his correspondence to the Fuhrer?

"Another failure of the ""justice"" system based on racism and bigotry of law enforcement and the judiciary.  4 lives damaged for a lifetime based on the same.  Since DNA technology was found, the false convictions of minorities throughout the nation have proved the embedded bias of the entire justice system all the way through the Supreme Court.  The Comments page reveals the continuing bias found throughout the populace despite proven facts.  If a Native or a Black is accused, he/she is automatically presumed guilty.  Disgusting."
"You've missed more than that. I wonder how many keyboard warriors that make comments like yours actually do something to help out our less fortunate canadians.  Based on their other comments of ""lazy immigrants, lazy blacks"" etc, I'd guess not much.
At the end of the day ""we have Canadians that need help"" does not mean we sit back and watch the rest of the world die. Canadian lives do not ""Trump"" others, despite what the media would have you believe."
"Big picture here.  Not that I condone what has happened, just seems like blind eyes are turned to the alt left (black panthers, BLM) while the alt right does ONE event and NOW things are unacceptable.  Seems very one-sided."
"It is a reason to report and also a reason to  get you or your family member(s) on a gang hit list.   This isn't theory, this is actual deadly fact.  

Your ivory tower may have a moat; Latrelle's mother and grandmother and his little sister and brother aren't so fortunate.    Neither are the relatives of  Juan.  Sureno Trece, or Southside 13 gang is in charge in his neighborhood and he knows it.

Last time Latrelle went to school the Crips beat him up for not paying a toll.  The week before that the Bloods did the same because his shoes were the wrong color for their 'turf'. 

Report the gang threats you know; don't saddle the blacks or Hispanics in Portland with your morality and a target on their backs."

Kaepernick has sacrificed his career and a lot of personal wealth on this issue. He's been threatened by powerful people nation wide and mocked by a President who has nothing better to do.

"Discrimination is wrong if it's against these people or Jews, African-Americans, Japanese-Americans, etc. . If these people want to serve our country and place themselves in harm's way to protect us, they should be allowed to do so.

"Way to early to rush to judgment. Did she yell her boyfriend had a gun and then did the man refuse the order to ""not reach for it?""
This may be another indefensible shooting, but perhaps not: it's too early to tell.
Here's what we know: the policeman approached a car at 9:00 at night; the driver and passengers were black. 
There is some confusion over when and how the police were advised the man was armed. Also, when- or whether- the policeman ordered the man to freeze.
Before condemning all cops, let's look at facts that play into these situations: a. Black areas are much more violent than any other; b. Black men have an extremely high murder rate. Ask yourself if, knowing this, you as an officer would not be extremely nervous/on edge upon approaching and interacting with a black person in a darkened vehicle at night. And no, there is no ""training"" that prepares an officer to let himself be shot before he shoots.
This is NOT condoning the shooting. It is putting this in some context."
"This is exactly right Blue!  It took a lot of republican votes to pass the civil right legislation under President Johnson.  After that, the ""Dixiecrats,"" switched to the republican party.  Lincoln is turning in his grave knowing that is happening to his party.  

Also, those statues/momentos were erected in protest to the civil rights act and during the Jim Crow era.  This is an insult to people of color, put those icons in a museum."

"I want to be very clear on this matter. .................. I have numerous  BLACK friends who TOTALLY DISAGREE  with what Linda Hamilton is pursuing in her career as a PROFESSIONAL PLAINTIFF.

"Serves him right...

He's used to kicking black folks outta their homes. Just like Dad taught him. Put a 'C' on the leases, contracts with colored peoples."
"I'm not defending Schilling, mostly because I agree that he's a clown. It's about being consistent. Hill at the very least deserves to be suspended, but since she's a black woman, the hyper-Liberal ESPN brass is deathly afraid of being 'racists' by some blogger."
"No, it is like refusing to allow a racist to sell because he refuses to sell to blacks. That is the proper analogy, not your straw man."
"To the defenders of Trump, that 'he hires black people (Ben Carson, Omarosa)' is like the usual phrase when talking about homosexual or racial issues: I have gay friend, I have black friend, used as a shield of some sort.  It means very little.  What speak volume is his actions.  His actions, as listed in this article, show that he is a racist and a basic bigot - product of the time/era during his formative years and he has not progressed since.  Now shamelessly using race to divide the country just to strengthen his base is a crime against this country."
"What a silly post.  Your picture of Blacks in the South ""laughing and singing"" and honoring the ""Old South"" of slavery and segregation is laughable.  To be sure, over decades of slavery and segregation, Blacks learned (many of them ""the hard way"") to stay ""in their place"". To passively accept Second Class Citizenship, to drink from the ""Colored Only"" drinking fountain, to sit ""in the back of the bus"", to accept being called ""N##@@"" or ""boy"", to attend inferior, segregated schools, to be unable to eat in restaurants or stay in hotels, and all the other indignities that racial discrimination inflicted on them.  Oh, yes, Earl, they really ""fly that Confederate flag"" in memory of those wonderful years.  What an insulting post.  

The gas station?  Guess what, sometimes living with integrity and honoring human values is  bit inconvenience.  Personally, I'll run out of gas before I'd buy gas from a racist.  What you do is your business, What Mr. Dalton, I or anyone else chooses to do is ours"
"You are mistaken.  When you are a black person, complying and doing everything right, is not a guarantee that you will leave the incident on the outside of a body bag.  Have you not been paying attention AT ALL??!?"
How is the President encouraging police to shoot and kill black who are unarmed?
"Blacks and Jews are similar. As soon as there's any perceived injustice, the race and anti-semite cards go flying."
"At least four anti-black, anti-poor Cabinet members. Is this how T-rump is going to have ""95% of the blacks supporting him""???

The lunatics are taking over the asylum."
"Sure.  Donald Trump is elected on a campaign that began and ended with exploiting his supporters' intense dislike of Mexicans and muslims . . . and right-wingers call this black lawyer a ""race-baiter."""
"We'll see if President-elect Biff has followed tax laws, but what we do know is that he's a narcissistic sociopathic sex predator who has slimed his way to the top using the media brilliantly to smear everyone on all sides and dupe us into the false equivalency of comparing his lifelong lies and crimes to the mostly untrue and/or mostly minor errors of the Clintons.

Undocumented workers in the U.S. commit crimes at a *lower rate* than U.S. citizens. The IRS is *independent* of the executive branch (and the Clintons) in all but the most conspiratorial FOX-addled brains. The lawful election was won by two million in total votes by Hillary, so Clownstick has *no real mandate*. The ""leftist mobs"" are a *tiny fraction* of those expressing their horror of this lowlife racist creep, and the deplorable holes and trolls he will now enable.

These are all facts. But it's the age of Trump. Semi-literate, and semi-sane trolls ""no"" in their gut that the first black president is a Kenyan Muslim."
"There are very smart Black people who will join people of other races to boycott these jock clowns - without an audience and people buying their promotional stuff, just like the NFL they will no longer be a profit to own or know. Schools will lose donations etc.

Just watch. Many people have little respect for these often brainless jocks who think they are gods because they can dunk or throw a ball:) 

Adios! IDOLATRY that The LORD GOD hates! worshiping these folk is idolatry!"
One useless individual showing his true nature of a black soul without any redeeming qualities whatsoever.  A blight on the Comments section spouting hatred and violence as the basic tenet of evil.
"I grew up in Georgia, and I now live in Greeley... I see a lot of morons waving that flag up here. People who obviously are using it to make a statement about their beliefs on race.. I see a lot of intimidation of brown folks here. The last Cinco De Mayo I saw a big jacked up truck with giant Trump and confederate flags attached to the bed, with a couple young guys inside. They were yelling stuff at a latino family at  an intersection, and when the light turned green they took off in a big cloud of black diesel exhaust. It reminded me of my youth in GA. I was pretty appalled. By now I've lived in Colorado most of my life, and I'd never seen anything like this here. It was very disappointing. The lack of widespread racism is one of the things that made me appreciate Colorado.  Not everyone in Weld County is a wack job secessionist, Tea Party nut, or a racist troglodyte, but stuff like this doesn't help the county image and in the long run hurts our community on an number of fronts."
"What do you know, another Democratic Party / Liberal false lying story designed to foster racism,division and anger as well as draw the ignorant to the Democratic Party. Kind of like ""Hands Up, Don't Shoot"" ..... it just didn't happen. When are blacks going to wise up and see they're being flat out used and enslaved by the Democratic Party."
"Hillarp is right on.  Succinct and accurate.  I'm not sure why someone has to point out the obvious but if that's the limit your acumen, so be it.  Now I understand.  As for you claiming the article states that the second amendment has its roots in slavery, that's a bit of a stretch, isn't it.  Fairly hypocritical of you to talk about attacking rather than responding.  Pot.  Kettle.  Black.  Lol."
"When cops kill the ""mentally ill"" and cops kill African-Americans that's called justified self-defense. But when Nazis demonstrate and blow off a lot of hot air that's called hate. Let's face it - those tagged ""mentally ill"" are one of society's most hated scapegoats, along with the homeless, addicts, the indigenous, and the poor in general.
  The difference between Nazis hatred of blacks and Jews and society's hatred of the ""mentally ill""? One is sanctioned by society, the other is merely a lot of blustering hot air that society exploits to scare people."
"You don't know your church history at all if you think it didn't argue against heliocentrism in favour of  
geocentrism. Your arguing just emphasizes your ignorance of history.

The Catechism is filled with ignorant statements targeting women and the LGBT community.  Again, your denial highlights the depth of your ignorance in these matter. 

The church is growing percentage wise in Africa and the Asia-Pacific regions but declining dramatically in the West and Latin America."
There is also the fact that the black population in inner cities didn't feel Mr. Obama had really helped them.  The NYT ran an interview from Detroit where many African Americans said they felt let down so didn't bother to vote.  You can't take someone's vote for granted.
"The Trump administration is working on returning the US to a time before people had rights. Black Americans, women, immigrants, children of immigrants, and poor people will all be stripped of their civil rights. I hope this is yet another Trump disgrace that is challenged by the people in the courts."
"Well...we could ask the Obama administration for the good reasons why those 6 countries are on the list.  Since, of course, that's the info given to the current admin from the previous.  ""...other than they have lots of Muslims.""  hmmm...so if I were in Oakland (Raider Nation Baby!) and it just so happened that all the police were black guys, would it still be racist if blacks (Oakland is 82% black, btw) were the predominant race that was pulled over, arrested, investigated, etc.?  Hyperthetics won't do it here.  Hmmm....Ok...as to if it makes sense to do it....I would say it would be better to stop Mr T from getting here first, THEN find them and blow them up ova dea, then to let them in amongst the legit emigrees/immigrants/tourists/whatever and have to root them out of our vast nation full of hiding places.  Seems more efficient to me.  And in the long term more effective.  I will ALWAYS sacrifice short term efficiency for long term effectiveness."
"A protest by blacks now?  Um, not sure that's true, but even if it is, good for them.  I served to protect everyone's rights in this country afforded under the Constitution.  If a segment of our nation feels it's not being treated fairly, then they can certainly say so peacefully.  In this country, you can sit/kneel during the national anthem and not be punished for it, even if this government is trying to influence private industry to do exactly that.  If it's private industry's decision to allow their employees to do this, that too is allowed.

Too bad, so sad.  Trump needs  to grow a pair."
And this was any different than the black lives matter protests yet the response was more aggressive.
"I have mixed feelings about this. My first thought is that it's not a big deal to me if someone wants to kneel, whether it's Kap or Tebow. Seems like an overreaction by the fans and media. I'm a veteran and my response is a solid ""so what?""

But football IS a big business, kneeling is going to be divisive, and it's going to hurt the business that provides so much income to so many players and cause long lasting damage to the fan base when the NFL and the teams aren't the ones contributing to the issue. So why punish their colleagues and team owners by damaging the business that isn't involved? It's not a concussion protest. 

Players would do a lot more to the cause by working with police departments around the country, talking, donating time, or protesting on their own time. I'm just not sure how riling up the football fans helps prevent excessive force by the police on black Americans. There may be better, more productive ways of bringing attention to the issue."
"I sympathise, bigtime, with Bendheim.  I grew up next door to Jews who fled the holocaust.  So I understand his concern that this is, yet again, reverting to a racist issue.  However, in order to finally, sort this country, we are going to have to change the mindsets of Africans, who are so immersed in their ancient traditions, of  'Leader takes all'.  But, how, do we do that?"
The NAACP has a right to object to incidents of perceived racism. African-Americans are sensitive to racial slights every day and are subjected to the present political climate which has encouraged this type of overt racism. No person of whatever ethnic background should have to tolerate such callous disrespectful behaviour!
"Has Nancy Pelosi come out and denounce the female legislator from Kansas who posted ""she hopes Trump is assassinated? Those who watch CNN, have they done an in depth story on this legislator, a Kansas Senator. Has the DP done a story. Have any Republican come out an denounce her?
 
Are those words ""hate""? Would that then be hate on the other side? So both side engage in hate, and violence, and intolerance, expect one side ALWAYS get a pass, and then decries how divided the country is since Trump was elected. Time for the media and Democrats to take a long hard look in a mirror, a long with elected Republicans. These are the sides the country is divided, they left didn't get their way, Hillary lost. Bigotry, is defined as ""intolerance towards those who hold a different opinion then ones self"" Who is intolerant over the election of 
 Donald Trump? This Kansas Senator? Pelosi? The media? BLM? Arfait (sp)? all the above."
"Paul:  Sorry you feel that way, HOWEVER, when the Kettle turns black and all H # % ^ breaks loose, I am one of the people that will try to PROTECT YOU and  YOUR Family etc.  God Bless YOU and YOUR Family.............."
"Anyone who is a green baret knows what they are signing up for.  The are all highly intelligent and a cut way above the standard recruit. The President means well and is compassionate, he just is a bit blunt in his way of communicating.  He probably stated he knew what he was getting into as away of respect that he chose this honorable path as a self sacrifice.  Of course the family members are on a different paradigm.  They are grieving, going through anger (part of the grieving stages), women (often more emotional when grieving),and black (so may already predisposed to be anti trump, especially since he insulted Obama yesterday).  President Trump is learning the hard way that consoling loved ones is a difficult task.  Hope he can continue to stick with this role.  It will certainly defer him from commiting our forces to war needlessly."
"Wasn't he just pointing out the bizarreness of black students having a ""master""  over them..  Probably not funny, but in the UK and Ireland (2 countries that still have real humour)  it would be just shrugged off.  This country need to lighten up."
I still think there's a lot of Republicans temporarily crossing over to skew delegate pandering.  Blacks and Hispanic voters don't seem to be backing Sanders.  Something fishy going on in the Democrat caucuses.
"OK.  The slogan ""black lives matter"" is used to remind non-black people in the US that black lives matter just as much as any other lives.  Historically, in our country, we have chosen to devalue the lives of black people.  Responding to that slogan by saying that ""all lives matter"" (which is true, and what the BLM movement is trying to underscore) is, in essence denying the premise that the lives of black people are just as precious as the lives of anyone else.  
I don't understand why some find that slogan so offensive.  Why would the response not be: ""of course, they do, and we will do everything that we can to ensure that the lives of black people are accorded the same value as the lives of all others.""?"
"This is an incredibly short-sighted, and damaging change in law. I don't say this to be mean, I don't say it to be hateful, but the transgendered population suffers from a delusion: they believe themselves to be the opposite sex. They're not. They can never be. There is no amount of surgery, or hormone treatments that can make a person switch teams. All it can do is mutilate a person, and develop secondary gender characteristics.  This is not side-effect-free.

The last numbers I saw put the US suicide rate at about 4%. The transgender suicide rate was pushing 45%, and surgery didn't make much of a dent in that. That's abnormal. That's a problem. Black slaves in the US  didn't commit suicide like that. The only other group that did on that level were Jews in Nazi Germany.

You don't tell a schizophrenic that God really is telling them to do things. You shouldn't tell these poor people they've switched sides. These people need professional mental help."
"I am amazed that you were able to identify ALL the ""black civilians"" who work for, with or support Senator Sessions. How many exactly was that? 

FYI, all those ""voting block"" civilians are ""real people"" who support those ""black"" politicians you mention.

Now I do not know if Jeff Sessions is a bigot. I do not know if he is a racist. 
I do know that he thinks certain people are beneath him.....

I'll let you make that call, y'all."
One African-American in the GOP as opposed to the vast majority of Black Congress members who are Democrats should tell you something about the benign neglect of the Republican Party when it comes to people of color.
"Mr Abernathy, dog whistles in this context are not something dreamed up by the left. Lee Atwater, Republican strategist to Nixon, Reagan et al., explicitly admitted that ""states' rights,"" ""law and order,"" and other such phrases were seized upon by every R candidate after Wallace once it became clear in about 1968 that you couldn't go around saying (his words), ""nigger, nigger, nigger."" At the end of his life, Atwater realized his work creating these dog whistles had coarsened the public discourse and made racism among Republicans more hidden and yet simultaneously prevalent, and he repented of his folly. You are incorrect to now foist this myth onto the left."
"There are more firearms in the USA today than ever and yet the gun crime rate has been going down.

 http://www.forbes.com/sites/larrybell/2013/05/14/disarming-realities-as-gun-sales-soar-gun-crimes-plummet/#7c97705d7de9

The March Pew study, drawn from numbers obtained from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, also found a dramatic drop in gun crime over the past two decades. Their accounting shows a 49 percent decline in the homicide rate, and a 75 percent decline of non-fatal violent crime victimization. More than 8 in 10 gun homicide victims in 2010 were men and boys. Fifty-five percent of the homicide victims were black, far beyond their 13 percent share of the population."
"I'd argue the foundation for the distruction of Black America was laid by Woodrow Wilson with the capstone being place by FDR.  Margaret Sanger, and the Democratic Party have added gargoyles and spires to this gothic mansion of horrors."

"And your point being _ - - - -  ? You still don't know the REAL History, concerning Land and anything else because of your own ""narrow"" single mindedness of most African People.

I'm not gonna lie; a 32 yr old black nobody fella tearing apart a Holiday station in Anchorage would probably still be in E Mod right now. I gotta admit.
Black wives matter.  Wait.  That's not Woods.  It's black lives matter.  Yes.  Let's go with prejudicial law enforcement or clinical mitigation so that we can get back to golf entertainment.
Of course there is that inconvenient fact that their culture included slavery. Their whole economy depended on it. Even after slavery was abolished the southern culture had the keeping of blacks as second class citizens as its ultimate aim.
You don't get to decide who is black. Can it.

"If criminal behavior in the Black communities of Canada and The US were in proportion to it's portion of the population, 3% and 8% respectively, the number of police shootings would follow suit. But you won't change your behavior so you blame racism for the differences between your relations with police and the rest of society. Even though this is abhorrent to you it would be worth a try."
"I'm curious about this too. The camera person who was yelling to leave him alone and to give him space goes by BlueHair. The bald fellow who first approaches him is a Vet for Peace I read elsewhere. Don't think either of these were black folk, but I did see lots of black folk trying to hold back the crowd and to de-escalate Strickland. I really hope we get an in depth article with comments from all of the involved parties."
Not saying otherwise.  But that's a difficult position to take when the descendants of the original inhabitants are being exempted from inclusion.  A seldom-mentioned fact in today's press is that Native folks are being killed by cops in even greater per capita numbers than black folks.  And that's WITHOUT including Latin-American folks (who are for the most part another branch of Native folks by ancestry).
"His post wasn't about ""any black person,"" but about this particular black person who displayed some over-the-top nonsensical reactions during Trump's diatribe.

Did you not read the article at the link that Chimborazo posted? The man behind Trump was not ""any black man,"" he was a particular black man with a specific past that Trump might not want to be associated with."
"I agree that fitting in is key. It is not just about merit. That being said…true story…picture a Senor HR executive with a major Bay Street Bank telling a group of black employees that the reasons why there are no black employees in the management pipeline is that there are no black MBAs at the bank. Also, picture the faces and absolute disappointment and horror of the black MBAs that were around the table with her. The point is, there is not always an opportunity to move beyond merit to then fit in. How would the black MBAs in this firm get a chance to prove to executives that they fit in if HR (HR!) did not know they exist. Career Advancement  101? It would be great if the opportunity was always there to exercise Career Advancement principles. There are so many other examples that I could cite, however at the end of the day, I am guiding my children to be entrepreneur as I do not want them to have the same unfortunate experiences that so many of us have had in Corp Canada."
"The left and the right are made up of individuals---some are intolerant and others are not.  One liberal does not represent all liberals, anymore than one black represents all blacks, one woman represents all women, etc.  Perhaps you should examine why you are so comfortable putting people in boxes instead of judging their words as individuals."
"Gee why didn't you include the Knobb post I was replying to? He's said far worse.  And why aren't you responding to him and telling him how uncivil he is? I'm waiting.

"""Black men, who had fought for decades for their right to these well-paying jobs, watched them evaporate just as they were finally admitted to competitive apprenticeships and added to seniority lists. When capital fled for Mexico or China, the shuttered factories in America’s biggest cities left a giant vacuum in their wake, decimating a primary source of jobs for black men that would never be replaced.

The economic vacuum would be filled with a burgeoning underground economy in the drug trade, which was met with a militarized war on drugs rather than an economic development plan. That war continues today — the scaffolding upon which our prison industrial complex is built and the firmament upholding the police brutality and oppression in black communities that result in far too many unarmed black men being shot and killed by police.""

"Notanelite, I've posted this so many times now...The issue here is not violence. Violence is bad. We must prevent it and those who break the law must meet justice. No rational person is for violence. No republican or democrat, conservative or liberal is for violence. But people are trying to distract us from the fact that one side in this issue wants to expunge America of Jews, blacks, immigrants and foreigners. The other side doesn't. If both sides engaged in violence, it does not make them equivalent. One side is evil and wrong. The other side is right. The choice is extremely clear. Which side are you on?"

"""Between 2005 and 2015 the number of black inmates in federal prisons rose by 71%. "" If Not sure what to make of that statistic other then in might very well be connected to a corresponding increase in the number of asylum seekers, who had limited skills and turned to crime as a way to survive. Low income workers are as well often over represented in prison, compared to those with skills and higher education. No one would really suggest that the crown went out and made up charges against blacks , serious enough that they would get a sentence in federal prison, as there would have to be a crime committed. The statistic could have reworded to read that the number of backs committing crimes increased between 2005 and 2015. Then what you would need to do is study the socio-economic factors of those committing the crimes to see if you can account for the rise. It's far easier for the UN to publish a report that says the justice system is corrupt and racist."

"Now see I don't think we have taken steps backward.  It is the left that continues to divide us by race, religion, sex and wealth.  Every platform they have is how one group is being oppressed by the other group. Seldom do they talk of unity and the progress we have made as a county.  My gosh we just had a 2 term black president.  We have women, latinos and blacks on the supreme courty.  We had a woman as speaker of the house and one just win the nomination and a major political party.  This is a far cry from the 1960's.  Maybe if the left celebrated our progress instead of looking for the next political issue to divide us we would not have so much hate and anger in our society.

"Yes, there are gays who have tried to get the LGBT community to be accepted. And they have had a great deal of success, although not complete success. I wish they would have more success. I hope that anti-gay bigots would learn to accept them as well, and not fear them.

Perhaps you are unaware of my family. My mother was an Austrian Jew who managed to escape the Holocaust although other members of her family did not, including her parents.

I know that throughout its history the Church has had its black periods like it is going through now. The Modernists are responsible for the 'anything goes' thinking within the Church which prevails today from the top down; where lurrv has replaced true love.
She will recover however, as she has done in the past we have Christ's promise on that.
I had no idea that Dante had the divine authority to consign saints to hell, remarkable. 
To blame the Church for causing wars is preposterous."
"Its true that there are pockets of intolerance all across Canada but so far only Quebec has allowed itself to be railroaded down the wrong path. I note that the Bill is actually a bill to ensure religious neutrality in public but the only item being discussed are moslem face coverings... what about turbans, daggers, crosses , jewish headcoverings, black hats and robes etc.... none of them indicate religious neutrality so why are we only discussing niquabs?"
"A very interesting article, and well written. I wish you had paid more attention to the educational efforts of Catholic orders, like the De la Sallians. They left behind a legacy of high educational standards for black people. I am told that even  today the relatively good education standards in Zimbabwe owe much to Catholic schools. It is rather a paradox that education, the best weapon against inequality and racism, came to Africa via the colonial collaboration of Christianity (not only that of the Catholic church)."
"My wife was just a few pounds lighter than me, and she was 3rd degree black-belt in three different martial arts disciplines.  I once watched her stomp a mud-hole in three burly loggers.  If we got into a heated argument, she would unleash her best shots on me.  Then I would ask her if she hurt her hands, and she would go off crying, like most women do.  Besides, I was often being really ""snotty"" and provoking her.  ""Whatcha goinna do about that?  Huh?  Huh?""  Technically, it may have been domestic violence, but we really couldn't hurt each other.  We were too evenly matched.  But that was just us.  I believe that physical violence against a measurably weaker partner should be heavily sanctioned ... and that excessive, especially mean-spirited, verbal abuse against an emotionally weaker partner, be they either male or female, should be classified as Domestic Violence also.  Note:  Both of us were 24-7-365 open carry, and never even once, thought about taking our arguments that far."
"Mr. Igl, please.  Do not try to take the fun out of the modern PC liberal lynching of Mr. Dunn.  The perpetrators were just settling down to feeling good about themselves just as red-blooded Klan members would have settled back happy after lynching a black man some years back."

"You covered a lot, most I'm simpatico with though I think you fall well short of what's behind ""rebellion"", both collectively and individually. Though you no doubt mean well, you severely over generalize the motives behind individuals (black NFL athletes for example) actions, over simplifying and under estimating what there is to be angry about about this country. The individual reasons are legion, not just racial. Racism is just a free pass that allows our collective conscious to ignore the other root causes. I think MLK had it about right when he categorized our ills into poverty, racism, and militarism. I would add one more thing and that is runaway capitalism which serves as the life blood for this unholy triad. IMO it's actually greed, love of money and not money itself, that fuels rebellion at the collective level under the guise of proletarian values co-opted by different pirates who just want to get their piece of the pie  by feeding off of the commonweal carcass."
"Which demographic group is enamoured by National Socialism?

Judging by the demographic that voted for Sanders, an unabashed socialist, it would seem to be the millennials of all races and of all genders ( below 45 for males and below 40 for females) , of all pigmentations, earning less than US $50,000, with high school and some college education, the majority being single.

As for Fascism, those black clothed, masked Antifa protestors mimicking the gangs that agitated violently for Mussolini ( also a Socialist) , attacking innocents and destroying their property, including the police that attempt to protect the innocents and their property...9 out of  10 are still living in their parents basements...84% are male, 72% are aged 18-29, 90% single and 34% unemployed/ unemployable.

In general the US working classes of all races, genders and pigmentations , are not enamoured by either the National Socialists or the Fascists."
"We don't agree.  Political correctness is a sought after state that pleases the self-styled good progressive people.  Those who fall from the state of political correctness and shunned and treated poorly.  Being in the state of political correctness requires mouthing approved opinions.  We also disagree about what Trump thinks about blacks, women, Mexicans and Muslims.  You have never talked to him on these matters and you have essentially zero factual data to verify your beliefs.  You have been told these things by your favorite media personalities.  His beliefs will become evident as his actions accumulate."
"Trump won a lot of counties with more livestock than people. A Wyoming voter counted for four times as much as a California voter; this is Constitutional, since a black person in the original Constitution counted for 0.6% of a vote, and a slaveholder with 100 slaves, controlled 61 votes.  So the Wyoming voter with five steers controls four votes. Now, THAT's democracy!"
"The law does allow you to grow your own. However marijuana can sometimes be
difficult to grow, depending on rainfall and other factors.  The plant can also be
vulnerable to mold.  Also only the female plants produce the desired buds so you
first have to sprout the seedlings and grow them until you can determine which
are the female plants and cull out the male plants. During this process, you may be
in violation of the law as the law limits the number of plants you can cultivate at any 
time.  Then there are those who will steal your plants after all your hard work.
As such many will opt to buy from either these approved clinics or on the black
market.  The downside of black market marijuana, is that you do not know how
they were grown and they may be contaminated with herbicides and pesticides.
You pays your money and takes your chances."
"1. Yes, I do.  Thank you.

"Kag, it's Black Lives Matter who proposed the police be turfed, and the Pride Committee just agreed to it at their AGM. Of course, the Pride Committee isn't the LGBT community. BLM halted last year's parade for almost an hour."
"While not my cup of tea, Lomax is ridiculously overqualified for the job.  He's a black (and hispanic?) guy, so he'll probably address the racism in HPD.  Domestic violence is an important issue to Lowery.  Ballard was one of three finalists when Boisse Correa got the job.  Acceptable good ole girl in the good ole boy's club?  If the fix isn't in I can't see how Lomax doesn't get it"
"There is next to no evidence that slaves actually fought for the Confederacy.  It wasn't until like early 1865 that the Confederate Congress approved conscripting slaves as war fighters.  Apparently,  only two companies of black troops were drilling in Richmond when Lee surrendered at Appomattox. 

Hell, even in the North, there was considerable resistance to arming black troops to fight for the Union, although eventually something like 190,000 black men fought in the Union Army and Navy. 

You need to check the record about Lee being anti-slavery.  Rich slave owners like Lee, and Jefferson and Washington,  found themselves in a situation where their personal feelings about slavery were of little consequence.  More and more often before the war, state and local laws actually forbade freeing one's slaves in one's will, or even freeing them at all, particularly en masse. ."
"Cut funding

last time with QUAIA (Queers Against Israeli Apartheid) marching in the Parade and playing politics

Every culture has done this, hell yours still does it in Darfur, Parts of Northern Iraq, and S Sudan.

"""Dwelling on past wrongdoing and being insulted by people in the present times who had nothing to do with the wrongdoing is irrational""

Odd.  No Canadian has ever said anything like that about American blacks.
And yet his 'people' make up 25% of prisoners but are only 4% of the population, a disproportionate rate far in excess of blacks in the U.S. He's not just experiencing discrimination, he's having his human rights denied. He doesn't have an elaborate infrastructure in place to protect his interests in the government halls of power, he goes to the UN for help. He's watching Canadians bring in 40000 Syrians in a 'Canada is Back' political stunt and then milk it for all it's worth while he's living in what others have described as third world conditions.  Residence schools aren't ancient history and there are people alive today who ran them.

This isn't a matter of 'getting over it'. It never ended."
"I'm reacting to the attached video--it's an example of the hectoring tone of feminists that puts people off the cause.

""People of colour?"" Everyone has a colour. Mine is a sort of dirty yellow colour."
"The blood is on the hands of Trump, Bannon and the rest of the alt right fascists that promote racism. No words from Trump are enough to forgive the hatred he's brought to the forefront of our country -- against people of color, against gays, against Muslims, and in many cases even against women. 

I pray for the victims of this horrific act, and victims of all other alt-right actions."
"This is just one side of the equation.  Perhaps it would have complimentary to look at WHY black people are perceived this way.  Unfortunately pop culture portrays them as bad kids all ganged up. In, Chicago on their June 4 weekend their were over 100 shooting incidents and 14 killed. Scarborough, Jane and Finch have similar problems. It's is this steady diet of negative news that clearly effects people's perception of them"
"I hear you. I have a great deal of respect for Anglicanism and have been a ""sometime Episcopalian"" for most of my life, what conservative Catholics would call a ""bad Catholic"" (not that I give a fig what they think.)  Years ago I lived in NYC and was quite comfortable worshiping at the Church of St. Mary the Virgin in Times Square which is a very high Episcopal Church with kind of a pre-Vatican II liturgy, in English. I'm told they've become quite liberal in their views on gay people these days even though that was not the case back in the seventies. But their liturgy and the music was so beautiful I probably would have converted had I stayed. Where I live the Episcopal churches are quite different and don't do much to inspire me, so I stick it out at the Roman Cathedral where the pastor is very nice, preaches well, and is very welcoming to the few gay people who remain in the pews. All the power to you. You've made the right decision."
"Them your logic allows businesses in public accommodation to refuse service to anyone for any reason, and it's well established in law that such discrimination is not a right or businesses would be able to refuse service to blacks.

That means you just lost this argument."
"Since, as far as I know, NO gun comes off the assembly line earmarked for the criminal market, or the black market, or for criminal's friends and relatives who will transfer that weapon, I will stand by my original contention:  All guns in the hands of criminals or felons or fugitives have passed through the hands of ""law abiding gun owners""."
"Multiple names, multiple aliases. Read the story of the Edmonton Muslim man, kicked out for criminal activity, returned to Pakistan, changed his name, grew a moustache and quickly returned right back to the same Edmonton restaurant where he worked before.

Of course the restaurant owner, who sponsored the little darling BOTH times, knew nothing about this: until he got into a pay dispute with the fraudster, then shazzam, suddenly he looked familiar and the owner squealed on the immigrant. 

Canadian immigration officials floated a story about how the system worked when facial recognition software positively fingered the guy: after he had slipped through the tight security net for a few years though.

We know nothing about these third world cesspool immigrants. Their real names, their credentials.

We need to have genetic typing of these immigrants, we need to know where their families are.

They don't like it? Too much like Big Brother? 

Stay in your cesspool homeland."
"Fine but at some point reality needs to sink in for all.  I remember being hassled by police as a young teen of color.  Now I look back with shame because much of it was my fault - staying out late, doing drugs, hanging out with wannabe thugs, and having an attitude.  What I see (on all sides) are good intentions with no real understanding.  If you want to make a difference, stop
complaining and do something to keep our kids in school and out of jail."
They have already started to turn on each other.  There's a couple of videos of an Antifa activist haranguing protesters in Seattle for not physically attacking the police and the conservative marchers.  And then there is another of an Antifa activist punching a member of Black Lives Matter in Dallas.  The Purity Patrol is on the march!
"Agree.  The video made my heart bleed.  IN retrospect, many mistakes were made on all sides.  The cop appeared to have panicked to have lacked judgment.  Yes, she should have taken a defensive stance and yes, the suspect should have kept his hands on the wheel and not moved.  But one thing is clear.  If you are black, pray you are not stopped by the police.  The encounter can be deadly.  And yes, race and social class are a factor."
"This article and especially the headline are disgraceful and inflammatory but a good reminder of the sort of bilge spewed by the Harper government and his flaks such as the author of this diatribe. 
Disgusting.

In the present government there are many people who have strong Christian principles , look no further than the Mister of Health Jane Philpot who has devoted her life to the service of others including  years of  aid work in Africa.
To oppose some of the neanderthal anti social policies and discrimination that Scheer embraces is not anti Christian.
I haven't seen attacks by other parties though it came up in the NDP debates, but people are just getting a look at Mr Scheer who until now has just been a grinning face while they concentrated on  Mr O'leary and Mr Bernier.
This is nothing like the Conservatives vicious attacks on Trudeau and Dion and Ignatieff which were launched  as soon as they became leader, this is just people in general  discovering what his guy stands for."
"Once upon a time, ( 6 months ago),  we had a presidency with dignity, integrity, leadership,

"Ras·ta·far·i·an
ˌrastəˈferēən/Submit
adjective
1.
relating to a religious movement of Jamaican origin holding that blacks are the chosen people, that Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia was the Messiah, and that black people will eventually return to their Africa.
noun
1.
a member of the Rastafarian religious movement. Rastafarians have distinctive codes of behavior and dress, including the wearing of dreadlocks, the smoking of cannabis, the rejection of Western medicine, and adherence to a diet that excludes pork, shellfish, and milk."
"The fact this appalling man and his toxic sense of entitlement was polluting our media for so long is a disgrace.  He's being ""held to a higher standard""?  Higher than a lizard's standard?   ""He came out and boldly stated that the fatherless youth caused by a single/many fathers culture was the biggest contributor to troubled communities...""  and then boldly asked for the youth's phone number.   Believe me, he IS NOT an exemplar of the Black  community in Toronto, he is a lying hypocrite who insinuated himself into their political culture and highjacked a senatorship.  There are so many more deserving men and women to whom the youth of this community can regard with pride."
"Mental illness is no joke, I agree. But at the same time why did you choose to bring racism into play?  Musician humor and black humor are two totally different entities.  Like I said you need to lighten up.  The kids I deal with do better with humor than with trying to make them focus on what their minds have no concept of.  I deal with kids and have autistic kids in my family, and humor gets through to them a lot better than trying to explain what isn't important to them.  Being safe and secure is how  I choose to focus, not chastising."
"I was responding to your comment that liberals riot more than conservatives, a questionable if not ridiculous assertion. Now excuse me, I have to review three to five comments (to which I give due diligence) before I can post again, something which you claim you don't do. So again I ask you, did you view the video of violence in Trump's campaign rallies? Did you notice the obvious bigotry and otherwise low character of Trump's supporters? Would you rate the intelligence of any of the bullies and haters caught on camera as being smarter than average? or even, of average intelligence? Of course, people of low intelligence can be decent and likeable. but can you make that judgement about those thugs and bigots? Did you see any black or brown faces in the audiences, other than the man who was brutally sucker-punched?"
"GMO foods have a 100% safety record, far better than ""natural"" or ""organic"".  In fact, GMO is far better for the environment as the crops require less water, fewer, if any, pesticides and increased yields which means few acres under cultivation.  On top of that, GMO foods are healthier as they can provide vitamins and minerals that non-GMO foods don't supply. 
In particular Golden Rice could prevent thousands of young people in Africa from gong blind due to vitamin A deficiencies.  Unfortunately, this rice has been banned in much of Africa due to the dishonest scare tactics of rabid environmentalists.  When confronted with this fact the environmentalists retort is that their should be another way to prevent the blindness, a truly stupid response since there is no other way.   The result?  Thousands of young people are condemned to blindness all for the radical ideology of some environmentalists .
PS, I have no connection to any producer, user, seller etc of GMO products."
"That Ryan Saavedra lied to the police claiming that all he was doing was helping people out but all we see is that he video recorded.  If he was black, the police would have shot him first."
"Speaking of bashing, it was team Trudeau Butts black masked thugs that were beating and bashing on Canadians last week. No comment from either of our 2 PMs on the matter."
Why did the author and her father jump to the conclusion that the cranky lady for some reason hated to see a black child read rather than that she simply thought (unfairly or not) that the author was being cheeky?
"Gun violence? Who commits the majority of gun violence, the left. Take the shooting at the baseball practice early this year. And did you condemn the shooting. Before asking that we condemn Trump, condemn what your side does, which is much worse.
About Pro-Life. Why do blacks have a high rate of abortions?. In 2012 more black abortion took place in New York City then black births. Is there a racist component?"
"Using kids? As a Conservative Jewish Republican I've never understood Liberal Christian Democrat's obsession with making it seem that minorities are hated by Jews, Christian's and Muslim's involved with the Tea Party movement, Proud Southerners, etc. who drive trucks with loud exhaust systems. Is it comparable to assuming Ralph Northam supports killing mostly Black kids in the womb?"
"Then don't call yourself ""black lives matter"" Call it ""resisting arrest is noble""  No BLM protests all black shootings, even those justified. Very Very few of the cases protested we cases of brutality.

The Black Baltimore DA couldn't convict a single cop before a mostly black jury.

Ferguson MO was vandalized over a justified shooting, no brutality involved."
And the same three Blacks are shown off at every Trump rally. The same three. Imagine that.
"LOL! Yes, of course, ""apartheid made them do it."" 

But seriously. The signs about the true nature of the ANC were there all along. Torture camps in Angola in which dissidents were murdered, cowardly bombs and terror tactics targeting mostly black civilians, and the parasitic elite, such as the Tambos, living it up in London and elsewhere in Europe. Once a terrorist crime family, always a terrorist crime family."
The problem is MOST black men don't act like this when confronted with the police. They become belligerent. They run. Or worse they wrestle with the police. What can come out of those 3 situations is nothing good. If MOST black men would act like she did that have been shot they would be alive today. Cop tells you to stop reaching then STOP REACHING! Cop tells you to get down then GET DOWN! Cop tells you to stop resisting then STOP RESISTING! How difficult is it to comply with simple instructions from authority?
"You constantly tell me what I think but get upset when I return the favor?  For example, your comment about black liberals was made up out of whole cloth.  Therefore, you are the condescending one.  But I do admire how well you take us off topic by saying false things that you know I will respond to.  That token black lie was very clever.  But you throw the lie down knowing I will respond because no one likes to be lied about."
I don't recall him saying he lost his job because he is black.
"The majority of people used to agree with discrimination against Blacks.
Didn't make it right..."
"Charles, you do realize, or at least you should, that no matter how much you spread hate filled lies it will never make them come true. You may be happy with the crumbs from the table, your words when referring to to how the dem. party treats folks of color, but why must you continue with narrow hate filled thoughts? Why do you want blacks to stay happy with the crumbs from the dem. party? Why are you so afraid of a possible change? Are you afraid of loosing something to complain about? You have been shown repeatedly who voted for DT. While a very small percentage of those who did vote fit your description by far who you choose to lump together do not come anywhere close to your description. Would you be ok with me lumping all blacks together with examples from my life? Look to Richmond and Oakland Ca. and you will find many examples of racist criminal behavior from blacks.  Staying with the status quo means staying with failures, you may be happy with that but  I'm not."

"Leftist like this carnival barker misunderstand America.  They underestimate by country miles the intent of the formally known silent majority deplorable who will elect a real president this time around.  No time for the weak, the Marxist, the community organizer, as our great country stands on the edge of purposeful, contrived anarchy. We will not stand for a drama queen who wears the same progressive cultural Marxist ruby slipper.  The deceptive Wizard of the teleprompter and racist black nationalist against the majority will soon be replaced by a new deal president.  This time the new deal will be the real deal!"
"That is a lot of made up history.  Liberals were still beating and lynching African Americans just a few decades ago.  Liberals continuously created laws keeping blacks from voting, be it poll taxes or literacy tests.  Today they just relegate them to urban slums to maintain control of their vote."
"oh so YOU were the OTHER black guy here in 1975.  i commend you for bravery charles. i had a friend from san francisco come up, he wasn't here an hour and looked around  ""where are all the black people?  my husband said You're looking at him."""

I am enbarrassed for so many wonderful patriotic Black Americans who want school choice and the right to bring up their children as good people and good citizens who have been put down by these spoiled rotten uneducated people who wear spandex pants and throw a foot ball about for millions of dollars - GIVE ME A BREAK.

"The police rarely shoot and wound or kill people.  When they do they are investigated for their actions.  Sometimes their actions are scrutinized by Grand Juries.  Sometimes their actions result in trials.

For every black person shot by police, thousands of black people are shot by other black people.  If black players really give a damn about black lives maybe they ought to march though some gang-banger 'hoods instead of giving the finger to their fans.

"This is a typical use of minorities as tokens to defend failed government policies.

"The point clearly is that all historical figures are flawed because they all are human.

No doubt that General Lee and Lincoln were both great men.

But if you and your ilk wish to start tearing down statues of General Lee, then you can expect Lincoln and his cronies to be exposed for what they were: scofflaw, arrogant, self-serving, politicians who were fundamentally racists that wished to expel blacks from the U.S.

General Lee, by contrast, wanted to educate blacks so that when they were freed they could be successful in society;  his will stipulated manumission, not deportation from the US.

You wish to apply the mores of 2017 to 1861;  that is quite unfair.

Your 1st sentence about the Emancipation Proclamation is nonsensical.

"I do not condone what Pillar said but Kelly saying Pillar got preferential treatment compared to Escobar because Pillar is a better player is incorrect.  Both unfortunately used homophobic slurs however Pillar said it out of anger in the spur of the moment, Escobar had obviously thought about his word as he was writing the slur in his eye black and therefore a deliberate thought out action.  Typical Kelley, overreacting.  However, if it is known the pitcher is a homosexual that changes the matter in my opinion.  Then I would have suspended Pillar for a month.  Also Kelley is wrong when he says Pillar should have included the term in his apology."
"Most Americans' understanding of western expansion is obtained from movies set in the west starring John Wayne? Is that a fact or a rationalization? _Little House on the Prairie_ certainly romanticized the Old West and _The Waltons_ certainly romanticized the Great Depression. Now, look up any list of famous westerns and look at the plot. Even the ones starring John Wayne tow the line. If you believe that being lynched, shot, raped, starved, or otherwise terrorized by roving bands of thieves or railroad-hired thugs is romantic, well then, I stand corrected. Here's a list to get you started. Which of these romanticize the Old West?

https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2013/nov/08/top-10-movie-westerns 

Here's a valid criticism of portrayals of the Old West: they fail to show the rampant and violent racism directed at Native Americans, Chinese immigrants (who built the railroads), and the Mexicans of conquered Northern Mexico and that many cowboys were black."
"You have to look at this from BLM's point of view. In order for their organization to remain relevant they have to be the ""victim"". They have NO interest in making peace with police otherwise they would not have thrown their little temper-tantrum and demanded the police ban. BLM worldwide receives millions in funding. They have to create division and bully us so that, when we react, they can claim that we are the racist ones and are treating them unfairly. Then they still have a cause. BLM is a hate group and does NOT represent the majority of the Black community."
I saw him lift and 'air kiss' a small black child on CNN. He can't even fake empathy.
"I agree.  He was racially profiled because the Black's, not all Black's, but the Black thugs and criminals that give Blacks a bad reputation.  However, that is wrong!  No one should ever be judged by their race or color of their skin.  I'm Asian American, a Japanese American to be more specific.  I don't want to be racially profiled for crimes committed by other Japanese or other Asian nationalities because I'm Asian.  I would feel violated just as any one would.  I realize there is no perfect solution to remedy all this and I'm sure this has been tried but maybe a better effort for the Black communities and even Asian communities to police, correct, mentor and better educate themselves and point out how their actions (good or bad) affect others of their nationalities and race."
"The SPLC, the authority on hate groups in the U.S., puts KKK membership at as few as 5000 people out of  a population of 333,333,333. 

Your article is based on some lunatic fringe group representing some infinitesimal amount of 1% .
I'll bet there are more people who practice voodoo in Louisiana and voted for Obama than KKK who voted for Trump. 
Why not list some examples of what Trump is doing that is making this the worst Black History Month ever?
You've added your voice to millions that have expressed concern about the treatment of blacks in the U.S. How many people are advocating for the victims of racism in Canada's Atlantic provinces? Seems to me that if you are driven by genuine feelings of virtue you might want to be the first."
"You must be getting your information from Fox.  Regarding pre existing conditions. The reason Obamacare requires everyone to carry insurance (remember, this was a Heritage/GOP idea) is so that people carry insurance even when they didn't think they needed it.  So, when a crisis arises, you're not cut off by your insurance company when you get really sick.  Prior to Obamacare that's what was happening.  Or we all subsidized people without insurance going to emergency rooms.  Obamacare tries to spread the health risk over the entire population.  Much needs fixing, but most of the GOP doesn't even understand how the whole system works.  Remember Romneycare.  The republicans loved that system which is exactly what Obamacare was trying to copy.  Problem is that a black democrat proposed to implement a republican idea, and that is NOT acceptable to the Fox News lapdogs i the republican party."
"They could just walk over from the Capital to the  P  Street  area,  know as""The War Zone"" to see for themselves what Obama and 40 years black Democrat mayors have done to black lives in America. They don;t need Trump to tell them whats wrong. They need Trump to make them listen."
"In 2016 a college educated ""professor"" doesn't understand how inappropriate, insensitive and professionally damaging dressing up in black face is?  If she were ignorant of racism and didn't understand the Jim Crow type of racism this represents, perhaps we could say she was just uneducated.  Her First Amendment right to freedom of expression is protected, as she is not in jail, but her employer deems such behavior as a detriment to teaching students.  Her colleagues and students see this as demeaning to them.  Years of doing the right thing can cause your entire life to change when you display bad judgment, like deciding to drive on the wrong side of the street and wondering why you are in the Emergency Room.  If her employer doesn't feel she can teach students effectively, why are we whining about our PC culture and expressing how this shouldn't be a big deal.  Racism in all of its forms is a big deal and those that don't understand it, likely never experienced it."
"There are a lot of factors that lead to the number of black professional athletes, but racism by team management isn't one of them.


Except in your mind, of course.  No surprise there."
"For all the moral aspersions continually cast out by the self righteous virtue signalling Trump haters I say the left today is itself morally and intellectually bankrupt. They ignore balaclava wearing leftist violence, support murdering unborn children at any stage of gestation and care only about power. Where are the big ideas they stand for? BLM? Transgender bathrooms? Really?"
"Who knows. Washington is a cesspool of rapists and crime like most large US cities. Thanks to the panty-waist-in -chief's failure to address the problem of urban crime, America's cities have remained a festering cauldron of discontent, crime, murder, gun violence, and last but not least, sexual assault. against women. Be careful, women. You just never know."
Disparity in sentencing is not confined to black people but to Native Alaskans and other minorities as well.
"Surely anyone who is sympathetic to gay pride should be allowed to participate. 

By the way, the police shooting water pistols might not go down too well in the black community."
"Why is it ""had to counter"".

Just because you don't want to hear it doesn't make it invalid.

I call it ""fair and balanced"".  Even black people can do that."
"Obama didn't molest and degrade women, or make such a fool of himself.
Obama, however, faced a continual stream of racist attacks from the American Right.
Have you forgotten how Trump, the Birther in Chief, claimed he had proof that Obama's birth certificate was forged?"
"HUH?  Seems you too have forgotten Kraperkrap?  Hates his country, hates the police. Supports BLM. And you have the nerve to say Trump started it?  Get a life."
"“human dignity has no nationality”? This whole piece should ended with “for blacks” instead of “not discrimination”. A Nigerian comes to South Africa, applies for asylum or citizenship and gets it. The Nigerian becomes a Naturalized black South African. Nothing wrong with that right? Consider that this Nigerian will now get to vote, all the perks of a South African, he will get a job first and even have first option on tenders and business opportunities, his children will have first option to bursaries, sponsorship and even university accommodation and so on before any South African minority group. Not only will these immigrants help the ANC stay in power but they will help further economically side-lining minority groups. This is of course if minority groups aren’t exterminated by criminals and “normal crime” beforehand of course. This is why the ANC will welcome immigrants. This is only one of many strategies enforced by the ANC. If this isn’t a message, then I don’t know what is."
"Talking about murdering politicians is dreadful, especially in a country where that's always a possibility.  I hope you also think students talking about lynching a black coach and student within a small school community is dreadful.  It would help if you actually said so, instead of making up a straw man 'social justice' crowd to rant about."
"Motley, You're a clever writer but your attacks on Lincoln as a ""pig"" go far beyond civility or accuracy.  If you had the entire collected works of all Lincoln's writings and read and reread them as I do, you'd see you are taking a few odd quotes out of context and totally missing the essence of the Man.  They are great for shock value but totally unfair.  Unlike Deady, Lincoln  was far ahead of the crowd on slavery; though he'd been raised with the typical racist beliefs his guiding star was the Declaration of Independence, with its solemn oath  ""All men are created equal.""

But for  major SHOCK value, you'll  have to go some to beat this quote from a February  18 column  in the Eugene Weekly:
""Negro History Week started as an internal Negro Community Celebration, remembering the birthday and the difference between Frederick Douglass (my personal favorite Republican) and Lincoln (my least favorite Republican who edges out Ben Carson and Donald Trump). """
"The mindset change is required from every South African. I have predicted collapse an apocalypse for the last fifteen years. It has come and I am afraid. I was wrong. In the end it was not ""their fault"". The fault is mine. My own intransigence to change and accommodation of others brought this about. I stood on the sidelines and felt only schadenfreude. I am at the cusp of seeing the destruction of the enemy and I feel only trepidation. No joy. We are in trouble. The country is not ready. There is too much ""us"" and ""them"". In the end we are going to need each other to save this country. 

What we are asking of the ANC members, is to destroy their own party. They are damned if they do and damned if they don't. Getting rid of Zuma will destroy the ANC. If they don't they will lose the 2019 election. I think they will lose anyway, but I do not expect them to go quietly into the night. For many, it is a life and death issue. They will fight.

Quo Vadis? indeed."
"Talmud is a Jewish text.  Jews tend to be Democrats, not tRump supporters and stood with and marched with blacks during civil rights - so puh-lease get your name straight without insulting a whole group of people.  You were responding to ""tulimd""."
"Interesting stuff, oldgit.  

I've always been fascinated by the fact that many men (Lieber and Stoller, Lester Sil, Bihari bros, Ertegun bros, who wrote and produced such stand-out R&B records (Coasters, LaVerne Baker, BB King, the Drifters, Clyde McPhatter, Ben E. King and on and on...) weren't black at all.   They were Jewish cats, and, in the case of the Ertegun, Muslims!  

They were all colour-blind and possessed a passion for what they heard."
We are lucky to have such an intellect as Dr.Ben take a position in government but I think like most conservatives he doesn't understand the huge threat to our Republic. It is Communist G.Soros . professors and fellow travelers.He recently stated he will use blacks to destroy the US because they are easy to control.This doesn't appear an idle threat.
"Layla4, you seems to be unaware that neo-nazis are indeed targeting not only Jews, but Blacks, and Muslims as well. And gays. And Latinos. And Arabs. And liberals. And, and, and...

Is this seeming lack of awareness accidental, intentional, or merely feigned for rhetorical purposes?

In fact, they're targeting so many other communities and political persuasions that I'd hit the 1000 character limit long before the list was complete.

Don't try to kellyanne your way out of this. It won't work."
"Let's use this analogy:

There is a baker who is a Black Orthodox Jew. Three customers (a Neo-Nazi, a KKK, and a gay person) come in, separately, and they select items he has for sale and he rings up their individual purchases. 
-
Is there any form of discrimination there? No.
-
The next day, those same three customers return, separately, and they each ask the Black Jewish baker to decorate a cake they want to buy. The Neo-Nazi wants a cake decorated with swastikas and a picture of Hitler; the KKK wants the cake decorated showing a man being lynched; the gay person wants a same-sex wedding cake. He respectfully declines all three requests.
-
Is there any form of discrimination there, and if so, exactly what is being discriminated against?
-
""Yes,"" there might to some sort of ""discrimination""....but what is being ""discriminated"" is the ""artwork"" he is being asked to create with his artistic talents.
-
He cannot discriminate against ""people,"" but ""offensive artwork"" is not ""people."""
"Sarah, this is a remarkably good piece of writing. If it is coming back, you have perfectly captured an extremely compelling response: we cannot deny, this time, where this kind of thing is heading. Thanks to the scrupulous fidelity to ensuring the full story was told by your grandparents and their generation, willful blindness is bad faith. Not a one of us - not Muslims, not African Americans, not gays, not Jews... not a one of us should remain unprotected by those of us who have taken the obligation to the truth and to learning the lessons of history seriously."
"As shocking as it may seem to you allie, the President has the right to free speech too, no matter who it is. 
If you are working say at a donut shop, and you want to preach Black Liver Matters to my customers I'd fire you on the spot."
"Well, I think groups like Black Lives Matter are picking the wrong martyrs but many police surely get into that field because they like ""shooting stuff"" and driving too fast. Same deal with professional soldiers and other adrenaline junkies."
"Mr Saunders, like many on the left sometimes seem to have capacity for evasion of reality with a coefficient of infinite elasticity.  President Obama is a colossal failure economically, in foreign policy, and in domestic relations.  

Economically he has  more than doubled the US national debt to $20 trillion, put 46 million on welfare, 95 million out of the workforce, an annual trade imbalance approaching $1 trillion, a real unemployment rate of 10%+ not the fudged GAO 6%, Obamacare as a  failure, and an inversion problem with manufacturing and finance operations under foreign registry due to high taxes and over regulation.  

The Middle East is in chaos with ISIS in 28 countries,  600,000 slaughtered,  a million refugees  mostly young Muslim men destabilizing western Europe, the Russians and the Chinese emboldened. Our allies no longer trust us  and our enemies neither respect or fear us. 

Black Lives Matter endorsed  by Obama with 25 police officers assassinated speaks for itself."
"Seriously? No problem Trump. Just make sure you remove all the subsidies the US farmers get - those might be ""very unfair"" as well. Bit of the pot calling the kettle black."
"WTF
There is more dangerous methane from immigrants farts than cars. 
If we kept them on the other side of the planet maybe that side would heat first and destroy ISIS.
Who do I tax? I wonder if the CSIS would fund a black ops anti-fart program.....
Its as good a plan as the Liberals or Dippers have.
I think I just created a new and exciting trending meme"
"""mass desecration project""

Let's put some perspective on this indignation to the Hawaiian injustice.

Humans have a long history of repugnant injustices. Here's a short list starting with Genghis Khan invading Europe, then the Muslims, the African slave trade, the Armenian genocide, the genocide of the Jews, the Jewish persecution of Palestinians by evicting them, the Soviets in eastern Europe, the grievous abuse of Australian aborigines and N. American Indians, US invasion of Philippines during the Spanish American War, the murderous invasion of SE Asia and China by the Japanese, Rwanden genocide, the US invasion and destruction of Iraq...

Today, the US is belligerently beating the nuclear war drums with Russia and China, while everyone is destroying the earth's climate - that's the mass extinction and planetary desecration project we should all be concerned about. I do believe."
"So, BSc Hon, female, of colour, disabled............that should narrow down the field to 1 or 2 applicants."
"""The real issue is the relationship of social status to decency. There is no such relationship. It is not elitist to respect Muslims and Mexicans and African Americans and women and immigrants and Jews, and a blue collar is not a moral pass. A college education is not a requirement for, nor a guarantee of, a moral compass: There are educated members of the American elite who spectacularly lack one, such as the man who was elected president Tuesday. And there are “poorly educated” Americans who abundantly express kindness and solidarity for Americans unlike themselves.   Neither the elites nor the masses have a monopoly on qualities of character. But Trump’s American vision despises people at the top and people at the bottom. It is an inclusive vision."""
"MSW's quote from Bishop Sheil about blacks only having inferior opportunities reminded me of George Bernard Shaw's comment that in America ""they force the Negro to shine their shoes for them, and then look down upon him because he is a bootblack""."
"Lost in today's controversy about Trump's filthy attitude toward and language about women is the fact that he has resurrected the case of the Central Park 5 -- the teenage African Americans who were coerced into pleading guilty to a heinous crime they did not commit, subsequently recanted and who were eventually exonerated when DNA evidence supported the confession of the man who really committed the crime.  At the time of the crime, Trump led the effort to convict these young men in the press, even taking out a full-page newspaper ad declaring them guilty. Now Trump has renewed his attack on these innocent men.  This story is every bit as important as the one about his contempt for women.  Sure, he's a misogynist. He's always been proud of that.  But he's also a bold, proud racist.  Deplorable? I'd go with despicable."
"4. ""More factories are being built in America, especially the industrial Mid-west.""  
Do you have facts to back this up?  There have been two such new manufacturing facilities announced this week but prior to that there have been other factories closed and moved out of the country.  So before you get so sure of this point, do some research, please, TomQuinn.
5. Abortion continues to be legal in this (and many) countries.  I don't know what policies you are referring to.
6. Many would not agree that pulling out of the TPP and Paris Accords are at all a good thing, or wise.  But once more, the blanket and knee-jerk reactions of ridding anything touched by the black man Obama is more important then anything else.  Quite imbalanced.
7.  The stock market only benefits those with money, and now hey have more. Many economists see it as the prelude to another severe recession.  But who cares, Tom?  As long as you can earn more everyone else be damned, right?
More damage to follow, I know....."
"In this issue, Toronto's gay men and the police are allies, having a mutual enemy in BLM who wants to commandeer Pride , the police services and certainly with more demands for more power to come.   Pride was incredibly easy for BLM to take over.  POWER is all they want and Tory is giving it to them."
"I didn't see Linda Cohen and Rush Limbaugh's name of those who ESPN, has disciplined. Cohen was suspended because she commented that ESPN was being to political, for a sport network. And Limbaugh resigned from Count Down, same years ago, for criticizing the media for protecting black quarterbacks, from criticism. A media that told us it was racism to criticize a black president years later.

On CNN last week another black female sport report, Pam Oliver, said Hill was just expressing an individual point of view. Well isn't that what Cohen and Limbaugh did, or everyone of those mentioned in the piece, that either got them fired, suspended, or who resigned.  It's been reported ESPN lost a billion dollars, because of cancellation, and it appear Disney doesn't get it. Sport used to be a escape from daily life, however ESPEN has brought daily life to a Sports channel."
"It is shocking how Ismaili spokesmen have become apologists for Islamist terror. One would think that an Islamic sect that had know persecution and terror at the hands of the theocrats and imams who today direct mayhem at the West, would be the first to set distance between themselves and the holy killers, but that has not happened. Instead we get rationalizations and minimization of the issue. 
My take is that their position in the wider Muslim Ummah is too marginal for them to stand up and speak without fear of fatwa and persecution, from Saudi or Pakistan based Islamic teachers and followers.
This self censorship makes many Ismailis poor advisers for non-Muslims who wish to understand the challenges of Islamism, Wahabbism and Jihadi violence for our nations future. You want to understand that, talk to a Salafi - there you will learn."
"The issue at hand is not discrimination against a person, it is against an event.  The baker did not refuse to serve the gay couple; he refused to make a cake for an event celebrating an event which goes against his beliefs.  Had the couple ordered a birthday cake, or a generic cake, or ordered a wedding cake for their straight friend, the cake would have been made because it was not the couple being discriminated against; it was the event.  

Can a black baker refuse to make a birthday cake for a KKK grand dragon?  Can a black baker refuse to make a cake celebrating a KKK anniversary?  

Can a Jewish baker refuse service to a neo-Nazi?  Can a Jewish baker refuse to make a cake for a neo-Nazi protest rally?  

Can a liberal baker refuse to make a cake for a conservative politician?  Can a liberal baker refuse to make a cake for the Donald Trump inaugural celebration?"
"What overseas business? A hotel? Trump wouldn't know what to do with a hammer much less managing people. Filed for bankruptcy 4 times and screwed the investors. He's a dangerous, misogynistic, racist peccary who represents the worst in American politics and you'd vote for him...

Enough of the ""If he had..."" rear view look. Obama's record speaks for itself.
Your claim of incompetence is just sour ""racist"" grapes because you lost the leadership of this country to an intelligent man with black skin. Then along comes Hillary Clinton - your worst nightmare - to slay the paper dragon trump.
Things are looking up!"
"If he had been a muslim, lesbian trans person of colour there would not have been a peep due the prof being higher in the victim hierarchy."
"You mean Obama's policy on illegal immigration,  or building up the military, or embracing and helping Israel, reducing taxes, cutting regulations that are killing small business, or the pipelines that have been approved,  o maybe health care,  right,    ahhh poor little black man,  jeez  get a grip,  we don't like him because of his policies,  get it,  nothing to do with race."
"Really hip cool progressive folks refer to black folks as ""brothers and sisters.""
Just sayin'.
lol"
"Also, continously going back to race, sex in the article. Its part of the problem with the lib-left narrative that they seem to miss the connection to culture. Race, sex is to base of a generalization. Dont judge an actuon based upon culture as reflecting race or sex. The video of the black phd student vicious assaulted on the national post is disgusting because he is culturally high enough in social standing to never have been treated with such extreme excessive force. I dress like that guy. The police force is supposed to fight the bad guys, not be the bad guys. If he was dressed like a deranged homeless lunatic then maybe using pre-emptive action would be appropriate, but he was not, regardless of his race. At the other end of the spectrum, building a wall with Mexio is not racist. Mexician isnt a race. By the lib-left not incorporating cuturla differnces, they are invalidating their responses."
"I greatly admire and respect Mr. Lewis for his historic and steadfast work for his civil rights  work for Blacks and minorities. That being said, I am disappointed in his delegitimizing the current President and refusing to attend the innauguratiom. This is the second time he has assumed this position because he felt the elections were unfair, rigged, incorrect. G.W. Bush and Gore tied, settled by Supreme Court, he felt it was the incorrect outcome, even though the decision followed the Law.  He is assuming a same position today, states it was an illegitimate election because the Russians tampered with it and I have to wonder if his dislike for the candidate isn't included. So Mr. Lewis you are entitled to your personal opinions and actions but let me remind you that as a Congressman from your State you are until you are no longer in Congress the representative of ALL who reside in your District and should  show respect for the Government including  The Office of the Presidency."
"offending people...women got the vote by offending a massive amount of people
blacks in the US earned a place in business in school and in life by offending a considerable amount of people,  Europe's aristocrats and clergy were offended to no end by French peasants reading and thinking for themselves .... offending a few people when they deserve it has an quite an honourable track record"
"And Gary maybe count your blessings some won't show up...seriously!

""Racial prejudice, not populism or authoritarianism, predicted support for Trump.""?

According to the exist polling Trump  perform better than Romney among blacks, Latinos and Asian Americans. The same held true as compared with McCain with the exception being McCain performed slightly better among Latinos. And Trump performed as well as Bush among blacks, Latinos and Asian Americans. 

Not at all hard to see why Hillary lost when her supporters are claiming of all things that Blacks, Latinos and Asian Americans who voted for Trump did so out of ""Racial prejudice""....Now that is Rich...LOL!"
"I see the Confederate flags at Republican rallies. I don't think they are intended to make me feel like an equal American with Constitutional rights like the 2nd Amendment. Police shoot black folks for merely being suspected of owning a gun. The cops that kill unarmed black people get time off with pay. Us tax payers pay the settlements for the wrongful deaths, not the cops or the unions that defend them. I don't appreciate my taxes supporting murderous cops. All I want is equal protection  under the law. We have never had that in this country."
"ANTIFA becoming exposed!

One of CNN’s own hosts was just spotted at a rally backed by the radical “antifa” group… and instead of being there to report, it looks like he showed up to stir up the mob.

W. Kamau Bell is the host of CNN’s “United Shades of America,” and, according to PJ Media, he was caught on video yelling into a bullhorn about Nazis and “black people” at a rally with a very shady history."
"Brandon said he is not a football player 24 / 7 and I agree, I was not a contractor 24/7, but when I was with my customers I did not insert my political, religious or any other controversial issue into my dealing with them.  The same can be said here, play the game and if on your time you want to stand on the capitol steps to voice you concerns about how you are being held down by society while you make millions playing a game then go for it.  I would applaud you for you beliefs even though I don't see the problem black people seem to be protesting, those who want to work hard can be as successful as anyone else, as Nike says ""just do it""....."
"Since when is equal treatment by law enforcement (liberty and justice for all, which is part of the pledge you apparently hold sacred) a ""foreign belief?"" What Kaepernick and his fellow athletes are protesting is the disproportionate killing of blacks by cops. Why does that bother you? Your racism is showing."
"Sessions will get the nod as Attorney General. Sessions prior life in Alabama was not a bowl of cherries but he hasn't demonstrated anything that could construed as racist. I think the better term would be "" politically motivated"" that was unfair to the black people. He did threaten to lock up those 3 black protesters for a very long time so yeah, he used it as a tool for intimidation. We'll see what kind of spine he has while in office with Trump as president."
"Please.  We all know that America is going to be conquered by space-alien robots long before the Muslims get us.  Hasn't Bannon been watching the movies?


""This is not because Bannon had a hate or dislike for Muslims,"" Watkins said. ""I believe that he believed that no society is without its radical fringes.""   I'm not even going to swing at this softball pitch..."
If they get rid of specialty schools does that include the dedicated to black (sorry cannot recall what term I am suppose to use) studies?
"I did read it but I took it as a positive that Americans would elect a black President, not that he was elected because he was black.  Those are very different things.  I tired of the claim of reverse racism, as if a person of color can't win on intelligence, character or leadership.

We both voted for him apparently for reasons other than his skin color.  I think that true of many people."
I'm sure the NAACP is looking into the friendly behavior exhibited by black TSA employees.
"To the ""the brain is still developing, we need to make the age 25"" group:  why stop at pot legalization?  Make it the same with alcohol.  And while we're at it how about other decisions that should require a fully mature brain: military service - disregarding that the rashness of youth is why the age is 18 because by 25 it is far less likely they would voluntarily sign up.  And then on to contracts, especially those student loans.  
Or we could recognize that almost all the propaganda about pot has been from the US and it's full intention was to discredit Hispanic people, Black people and anti war protesters and was never at any time based on health.  Pot has been available to me my whole life, 50+ years, however I've never used it.  I agree that education needs to be ramped up to inform on possible long term health impacts but then I also believe that should be done for a variety of other legal drugs: alcohol, caffeine, OTC drugs (ex. Tylenol - kills more than pot yearly)."
"Do you think that these players are protesting their own circumstances?
Are they as shallow as your argument?

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game.

""",,,, the only conflict I see is between the headline and the content of Obama's speech  ...""   OMG.

Wow.  Let's see - how about  --- “No one has written your destiny for you,” he said, directing his remarks to “all the other Barack Obamas out there” who might one day grow up to be president ... ""Your destiny is in your hands, and don’t you forget that. That’s what we have to teach all of our children! *No excuses! No excuses!*""  

Can't hardly be more clear than that!  

Mr. Obama also scolded the black community to show a little more responsibility as parents and to encourage their children to do well in school - with the clear implication that those families where this doesn't happen, are setting themselves up for failure.  :-/
(He was right.)"
Are you aware that one of the most important reasons the NRA was formed was so Black Americans could learn how to use firearms safely and effectively due to the KKK? Every citizen has the right to keep and bear arms.
"Joe Smith, I'm afraid you live in a fantasy land if you believe that French and British rule uplifted Africans living under that rule.  You should read up on how King Leopold ""Uplifted"" the population of the Congo, for example.  The colonial powers were there to EXPLOIT Africans, and any ""uplifting"" that went on was by and large a side effect of needing a functioning local civil service so that the exploitation could proceed apace.  The biggest tragedy is that when the colonial era ended, many countries just kept doing what they had always been doing, under the same colonial era  laws and civil service (i.e., exploit Africans), but now mostly for the benefit of kleptocratic local rulers."
"National news is broadcasting that the RNC is stepping up efforts to try and court black voters.  Yeah, the only time the RNC or a Republican presidential candidate pays attention to the black voters is ONLY during a general election.  Otherwise the black voters are only and after thought.  You can also bet that black voters are paying attention to the inaction of Republican controlled state legislators and Congress who are blocking responsible gun control.  Republicans should lose control of Congress just based on that technicality."
"Hi Allaha. I know you're just trying to be funny, but you know better. Racism is never funny. Think for a moment about how this might hurt the vast majority of innocent, law-abiding, caring, kind, bright, and beautiful Blacks, young and old, female and male. Think especially of Black children, the keiki, the most innocent. I know for a fact that you would be protective of them just as much as you would children of all the other races. This is especially true in Hawaii, where aloha for children is a given. Peace."
"Well if you're looking for something that is in your best interests, you'd best not look to any Republicans.

That's not what they're up to.

They aren't out to make healthcare better for consumers, they're out to make money for their corporate sponsors and the wealthy interests they do serve.

I wish him well in bringing his genius and leadership into this new chapter in his life."
"If Trump opposed racism, he would hardly be calling for the firing of black athletes who take a small symbolic step to protest racial violence against people of colour. Even you have to say the careful sentence: ""Trump says he opposes racism.""

He's the one who has escalated this.  I don't know if he himself is racist; he's primarily in favour of anything that he thinks helps Donald J. Trump."
They'll distort things just as the Smithsonian did when they omitted the Conservative Blacks.
"Good call.

The MPC is not racially representative, as you wish for - Blacks and Indians are disproprotionately over-represented.

I look forward to seeing your earnest endeavours at changing this situation.
(Whilst you are at it, please have a word with your mate M'Baks about Bafana Bafana).

Could you also please produce some original ideas of your own, instead of quoting quite irrelevant quotations from the likes of Fanon.

How about explaining what kind of detailed monetary policy it is that you want and showing how that would grow the economy, curb inflation, increase investment and reduce debt:GDP.
You could even share with us your Econometric modelling - I would be happy to critique it.

Zero or very low interest rates whilst inflation is around 7%? Explain what effect that would have on the economy in the medium and long term."

I am unsure what misinformation you are referring to. Are you suggesting that the number of blacks shot and arrested is not done way out of proportion to their numbers and that there is no racial profiling and prejudice toward the black community?
"While we are at it, how about we make a monument to that great Democrat George Wallace or, perhaps, that great Governor of Georgia Lester Maddox, a Democrat whose claim to fame was his refusal to serve black customers during his time as a restaurant owner.

Then again, for those demanding a more contemporary statement, how about we demand the Democrats acknowledge how Black Lives Matter and Antifa are strongly allied and supported by Democrats while also being deeply bigoted organizations built on hate and violence.  After all, when these groups appear, they are always there in numbers far superior to those on the Right whom they are protesting, whose opponents are always deemed to be Nazi, racists, or whatever regardless of what they really believe, and who become violent even after those they are counter protesting leave the streets as witnessed in the debacle in Boston where dozens were arrested.

"Yes, by what authority does the UO administration impute meaning to Shurtz' attire or makeup? As does every other citizen, she retains the right to construe her appearance however she wishes. For instance, the president of the U. S. Is of mixed race. But he elects to define himself as a black man. It is the UO which has harassed Prof. Shurtz. It simply paid a private law firm to manufacture evidence."
"The protest has nothing to do with the military.

It is about excessive violence against blacks by the police.

Glad I could help. :("
"Sorry but that sounds like a red herring talking point of republicans.  It is no more about him than it is about disrespecting flag or country.  Fundamentally it is about the right of black citizens to peacefully protest how and when they so desire, to demand equality of citizenship, freedom from and freedom to - and his attempt to subvert that right."
"Helen Zille I simply admire your wisdom, experience and insight.  You are truly a relevant leader.  Such a pity that Musi cant be infused with these qualities and instead hinges on the importance of being seen as a ""Black man, first and foremost"".  Personally, this indicates a racial tone and the fact that his perspective is superficial...he needs, as a leader to get to the ""core of an issue"" and that requires the ability to move down the layers of a multidimensional and faceted being or issue. It is here that you often find commonality that has the purpose of cohesion...he is an essence, he is a being, he is a man, he is a South African, he is a DA leader, he is black!  If only he had operated from this basis, had the experience and foresight you display in your article....today, with the Gupta leaks confirming your understanding of the political status quo..he would be viewed as a relevant and balance leader, with vision. The tittle belongs to you! Take him under your wing...please!"

"I replied to that in my reply to my own post (just above this post).  I'm curious why, in 2016, Trump only got 8% of the black vote, but in the key Southern State of South Carolina, he carried 26% of the black vote.  Why did that happen?

Nikki Haley, a Tea Party Conservative, won her re-election in 2014 for Governor of South Carolina with 56% of the vote in a state that's 31% black.  How is that possible?"

"LG, this time we disagree just a little.  

In reading the plaque, the onus of responsibility seems to be on the police and firefighters, fostering, I think, more distrust & hatred of police.  No mention of the fact the firefighters feared for their lives from gunfire coming from inside the house. No mention the bombing was not halted by the mayor - a black man. No mention the police were there to serve warrants & make some arrests - and that the neighborhood had been complaining about the activities at the house.

A terrible tragedy.  No doubt of that. Eleven dead and 60+ homes damaged/destroyed. But the responsibility for the entirety of the situation is not strictly on the police and firefighters. Should there have been repercussions? Yes..and hopes that tactics for dealing with such confrontations revamped. But the plaque should reference somehow that BOTH sides had a part in this tragedy."
"The rules governing which faiths can be publicly mocked and misrepresented and which enjoy protected status is very complicated and ever changing within the progressive group think hive.

Catholicism seems to get a bit of a pass from the Canadian MSM even though the theology is on the conservative side of the Christian spectrum.

"Thank you, Civil Beat and Brian Black, for pursuing this.  The public should understand what the mayor’s fiscal priorities are and what we are giving up in the process.  For example, when the Honolulu Ethics Commission is significantly backlogged and the mayor doesn’t want to include funds for an investigator or for ethics training, the public should be allowed to have the background information."
Not to mention the prof at Ryerson who merely got up and left the room as a black woman was making a presentation.  Uh-oh. HUGE over-reaction.

"And roughly 15% of the population are black. That sort of gives new meaning to those numbers. Also, you're clearly not educated about the NFL and you should stop talking about things you don't understand. Their protest is in no way a breach of contract, and as a private employer, the NFL and it's teams have made it perfectly clear through statement after statement there is no requirement to stand for the national anthem. I don't agree with the protest either because I think it's mixing personal and professional affairs, but you're just reaching by suggesting it breaches their contract."
"Who says laborers were the deplorables that Hillary was talking about? She was talking about those racists and those that deny science, etc., that are part of Trump's base - and this was backed up by polls, too."
"And that has happened in New York state? Or maybe eliminating property taxes, income taxes and corporate taxes for ten years has generated a boom of business in the state? If the country did the same, only set as permanent policy, then we would see economic growth unlike this country has ever seen. These policies work and work well. Income disparity has grown much worse in the last 7 years due to democrat strangulation of business in this country. Also, unemployment among minorities, especially blacks and black teens has skyrocketed in the last 7 years. As many leaders in the minority community have pointed out, the democrats have done nothing to actually help them in any way. What do they say about doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result? Mmmmmm."
"Good point. But you waited to express this specific displeasure with the NFL until Black players protest to make your point?? I get that your sense of patriotism has been offended...but be sure to have similar passion when unarmed black people are getting killed by cops w/ no accountability among many other unAmerican injustices. I don't know about yours but my grandfathers AND grandmothers, father, aunts, uncles, brother, cousins, etc fought for those issues more than standing for the national anthem at the latest beer fest."

"David Brown 980. The Gathering Place not only provides a lunch program and food bank. People there work to change policies to fight for human and civil rights. The Gathering Place provides showers and a place to nap for people who have no place to stay at night. The Gathering Place is once of very few places where women, transgender, and children can go to actually be safe. It's not a perfect place, but much of what is there is a perfect example of what humanity should be like: Caring and acceptance.  It's a place where the people who go there talk to each other and help find answers by sharing their own resources, like change for the bus, like a place to stay for a few weeks, like a friend to talk to, like a couch in an apartment to rest in for a couple of weeks, like a place to share writing, music, and art."
"There will be some reluctance in some circles to accept Mr Singh as a leader of a Canadian political party.  It is a new thing, and there are always those who resist new things.  Mr. Singh could mitigate this by emphasizing Sikh CANADIAN and not a Canadian SIKH.  He already does this through his demeanour, his charisma, and his obvious comfort mingling outside the Sikh community.  He will broaden his base and vote potential by being Canadian first.  He will remain a minority candidate with pockets of electoral strength if he unduly focuses on his Sikhness.

This was the key to Obama's success.  He was a President who was black more than he was a black President,"
"""Obama took time to come out with statements and if I recall, his statements lacked a bit of bite to them as well.""

Your recollection is sound. I waited in vain for Obama to call out the racists in his country, even when blacks were being gunned down in droves. His comments were always bland. He blamed the killings on the easy access to guns, not on racism."
And if the Christian world does not disassociate itself from its extremist brethren and a president-elect spouting hate at rallies and in gilded towers.....
"As it did with South African apartheid, the international community has spoken concerning Israel's unjust policies towards Palestinians. But let's not kid ourselves: just like the Afrikaaners, Israelis are proud and independent. Israel will hate being told what to do. It will surely resist international opinion, just as South Africa did. 

There were a number of nations that were only lukewarm in opposing South African apartheid, and some that refused to apply sanctions when called on to do so. Israel was one of them. However, in the end, without a shot being fired over the issue, South Africa eventually relented to international pressure and did the right thing.

To be sure, doing the right thing in Palestine won't magically transform the area into a New Eden. Political, social and security problems will continue, just as they did in SA. But by removing an impediment to justice and equality, a much greater conflict was averted in South Africa. The same is true in this case."
"You refer to when she was FLOTUS?  The first lady was traditionally a poser who took up pet causes, Hillary wasn't much different. Only while Bill was in bed with the private prison Industry SHE WAS RIGHT THERE TOO. The Clinton legacy is neoliberal through and through, Bill ended welfare, signed Glass-Steagall away, and setup a pipeline of black boy/men from schools to prison.  While the CIA established a cocaine empire, Bill's crack laws filled his cronies' prisons ruining an entire generation of black children establishing the model of fatherless families. 

Yet the media played him up like the best friend to people of color, anyone pointing out his actual record was attacked, just like anyone pointing out Hillary's disgraceful record. Sure she had some pie in the sky idea for health care reform, Bob Dole responded with a framework that Obamacare matched closely. 
I can continue, Bill GAVE China plans for nuclear weapons, waged an illegal proxy war in Columbia and on and on."
"Yes, agree about Jews. 
This was strictly a snarky moment about labeling senators by ""color,"" and was meant to point out the fuzziness of thought when it comes to ethnic affiliations and demarcations. At some point it becomes inaccurate (and perhaps inflammatory) to participate in painting Hirono by the numbers as Asian, therefore ""of color,"" while the ""Asian"" Schatz is not."
"exactly, the US government fought the war to maintain the union. The 13th Amendment did not have the support it needed to pass when Lincoln used an executive order to free the slaves. He recognized that freeing the slaves would spell the end for the confederacy by enticing slaves to leave their ""owners"". provide more soldiers and general cause chaos in the Confederacy. In the absence of the slaves the Confederacy was doomed, The system of slavery had already ensure their demised but abolishing slavery just moved up the time line. The US government was right to maintain the union and prevent the death of a democratic form of government that was unique in the world and abolishing slavery was a tool in that endeavor."
"It is you, Tired, who ""deflects"", using a niggling difference that makes no difference.  The real point, which you refuse to admit, is that among your list of Dixiecrats who actually ran as Democrats, every one is dead, and the South, which before the Civil Rights Act of 1964, was the ""Solid (D) South"", now is the ""Solid (R) South"". As I said, Lee Atwater took advantage of the racist Southern reaction to the CRA by instituting the ""Southern Strategy"" to lure Southern Democrats to the Republican Party with implied ""hints"" of racism, using what are now referred to a ""dog whistles"".  Now, with Trump, this implicit racism is completely out in the open.  If Trump gets 10% of African-American and Latino-American votes, it would be a miracle, and a truly dark miracle indeed.

So it turns out that certain ""blanket statements"" concerning the deliberate currying of racism by Republican candidates is real and acknowledged, whether you are tired of it or not.  Trump has brought it out in the open."

"""I would be glad to hear any comments.""

And where would you hear those comments? You are not close enough with any black people that you go to their house for dinner and holidays, or they drive you to the doctor when you're sick, or you watch their kids when something comes up. If you were, you wouldn't need to ""hear any comments"", you'd already know."
"He and I mention it as proof positive the media is dishonest.  Even Fox's Chris Wallace got in on the dishonesty today----comparing a photo of Obama's crowd and comparing it to the crowd before everyone arrived.  On top of that , the Obama crowd wasn't an indication of how good the president was that just got elected.   Perhaps 70 percent of D.C. is black , and 98 percent of blacks voted for Obama.  Was there any doubt they'd walk blocks to show up ?   Trump won by punching people in the chops who dissed him.  That's how he'll make America great again.  Take the blinds off and you might see that."
"Solitary is aberrant mental torture for any age group, especially kids. The whole ""charge them as adults"" fiasco is also just wrong. If you can charge anyone as an adult, we have a crazed, revenge system. We also know that people up to age 25 do not have their full-brain-power yet. And, the idea of rehab for those convicted is laughable. What rehab? In the South they give felonies to blacks so they can never vote again. And their rehab? It's still working on chain gangs."
"Is that why you support a group whose very name is racist?  As if Arab lives do not matter, or Asian lives, or any other lives matter.   It is only that Black Lives Matter.

"Well as a Christian I am all too proud to aid my fellow human beings against haters.  You tout the law como eastas but recall that slavery at one time was legal. But people of good will sheltered people of color against the haters.  The same thing is happening today because hatred does not die.  We welcome undocumented immigrants into our churches.

People have their modern day witch hunts against undocumented immigrants."
"100% agree. CCB helps with topping up some of that lost income, income splitting would provide a small relief as well (the number is not huge but it helps) AND for those who have a parent staying home are helping free up daycare spots for those who work.

"What if USA Hockey just gets replacement players, and blacklists these ""troublemakers""?"
The political arena IS the public arena.What makes me twitch is name calling.  If your reasoning is correct then all the n-word means is black person...no big deal right? Let's ignore the political and historical context it come from.. The alt right specializes in it. This tactic is only ever used to attempt to shut down any civil exchange of ideas. Apparently the alt right and Trump supporters aren't actually interested in discourse they just want to hide behind it to spew their fear and hate.
Ant they mostly take jobs previously held by African Americans - and blacks know it too  - but have been bamboozled by their own Democrat leaders.
"Great exhibit, check it out, the LCHM, OBP,  and the Rutherfords should be proud of this material too often missing from our history.  Oregon's African-American pioneers faced a tough life just to survive. 
 And the Oregon Electric was a great line that shouldn't have been lost.

Here in Lane County, black railroad  workers were pioneers--Leo and Pearlie Mae Washington were the first permanent African-American    family to live here, arriving  in 1937.  He worked for the  Southern Pacific railroad  as a baggage handler and crew hauler.  They later took in black  boarders,  often railroad workers who couldn't stay in  local hotels. 

And of course our most famous early black resident was Wiley Griffon, who arrived about 1889 to operate the mule-powered ""Eugene Street Railway Co."" and later worked as a waiter on the railroad, allowing him to buy his home on the millrace at 4th and Mill in 1908, becoming Eugene's first African-American home owner."

"No doubt that Trump is a bull in a Twitter shop.
Who knows what his presidency will bring. 
What's more fun and interesting right now is watching the folks that don't like Trump. 
Especially the SJWs , globalists and celebrity ""I'll leave the USA if he gets elected"" luvvies. 
The same types that were anti-Brexit.
Their anger is palpable.
Despite the fact that both results were  fair and square according to the rules they believe they were robbed. 
The US electoral system that has served the nation for so many generations is apparently now ""broken"". 

One example.
Dem Rep John Lewis who has been re-christened Civil Rights Icon John Lewis spouts a conspiracy theory that Trump's 'russian-assisted' election isn't legitimate.
Trump blasts him for the failures of many of America'r inner cities - which are majority Black and mostly run by Democrats. 
That fact that Lewis marched in Alabama in the '60s has nothing to do with what Trump was talking about."
"I had wanted to elaborate on that last sentence a bit more but ran out of space to finish it (another annoying product of Civil).  By ""black mark"" I meant by hanging around too long, or worse, being a detriment to the Senate being able to pass anything (which is already a difficult enough task with the current Senate make-up).  

If he did hang onto the seat but left it vacant for months (especially now, and at this age), I think that would unnecessarily leave a black mark on the end of what's a great career of service to the country.  I would hate for people to think of that as his final chapter as a Senator."

"Its a fact that quite a few ""Blacks"" carry ""chips on their shoulders"".

"I wanted to hear your responses. I'm not defending any of O'Reilly's actions, he must deal with it. What I find interesting is that where are all your voices when the Black caucus stood on the steps of  The Capital and stated ""hands up, don't shoot"".  They knew it was a lie that they wanted to be true. The result, how much destruction and lives have been lost from this totally perverted action. MSNBC totally supported the actions of the Black caucus and others. That's a problem.  I'm not justifying O'Reilly's actions in his personal life or suggesting a moral equivalency with the actions of the the MSM, but there's something wrong when O'Rielly's personal life causes and outrage, but we hear little about the actions of Black Lives Matter and the  MSM enablers.  We could also discuss the carnage as a result of  ISIS, remember, the ""JV team""? There are many important issues in the world, but O'Reilly's personal life isn't exactly on top. The real goal is the remove him from TV."

"Mr. Haase: A ""flag-drapped coffin"" is a very big deal to, I would hope, all of us.  As has been repeatedly stated, the ""take a knee"" movement was, first, to protest the police shootings of unarmed black men, then it grew to represent a support of First Amendment Rights.  Yet some, such as you, seek to demonize those who demonstrated as callous, unAmerican uncaring villians.  Nothing could be farther from the truth.  Mr. Kaepernick took a stand...a courageous stand for something in which he believed......that is, equal justice for all.  That's an American value worth supporting......it's a ""big deal"" too.  
You state ""Yes, it is their right to disrespect the flag and the blood of the men and women whom died to set them free. "" That's an untrue and truly horrible acccusation.  The ""take a knee"" protests are certainly not a ""pout."" They are open protests addressing specif grievances and embody our First Amendment Rights.  IMO, as such they dishonor no one.  Gary Crum"

Our priorities are out of whack, and that does not bode well for the future."
"But the thing is, Trump cannot make money. He's barely managed to hang onto the money he was born with. So if you want to vote a candidate based on how she makes money, you better vote for Hillary because she's made a boatload of money without immediately losing it to bankruptcy or failed ventures as Trump has done. 

I think Hillary has probably netted more money than Trump, so I'm just fine with this principle of voting for the best businessperson. But Republicans don't honestly want to do that, this ""business"" approach is just a desperate ploy to try not to admit they want to vote the racist and sexist line. They just are freaked out that a black man won the Presidency last time and they're going to absolutely implode when a woman wins it this time."
"The author omitted to present the fact that before she was in the cab, the woman was able to text with friends, hail a taxi and remove money from her wallet to pay the driver.  The judge reportedly recognized  that the woman was operating at some level of capability immediately before entering the cab at 1:09 am, and commented that the prosecution presented no evidence about what happened between then and 1:20 am.  
I've seen nothing of what the cabbie presented to explain his state of undress, the DNA on his lip or his actions with the urine soaked underwear, and nothing that further specifies whether the woman's pre-1:09 am texts were coherent or more indicative of someone on the verge of black-out.
An appeal judge may provide a sober second thought on these very difficult facts."
"The Catholic Church should do that, but it won't because it's afraid of the African American community."
"LGBTQ rights are not special rights.  People are asking for the same rights everyone else possesses.  For example, the right to freedom from discrimination.  There is no federal law prohibiting discrimination in employment or housing that applies to LGBTQ folks as is the case for women and people of color.  It is up to each state.  Fortunately, Oregon's legislature has passed laws to prohibit such discrimination.  It is not only members of the LGBTQ population who appreciate having equal rights (NOT special rights) in Oregon, but also their grandparents, parents, brothers and sisters, other family members, and their friends.  If the government has any function it is to make sure everyone has equal rights under the law."

"As the photos and article show, this was a moving experience as Eugene progresses forward from our racist   past,   a time when blacks were forbidden to live here.  And as the marker, historic displays,  and various speakers noted, the basis  of this   segregation goes back to Oregon's 1857 vote which, following  earlier racist laws, placed the   hideous   Exclusion clause  officially   in our constitution of 1859.

This is significant, for as recently as a May 7th RG article,   esteemed emeritus  UO law school Professor James Mooney and other notables ridiculed  UO's Professor Charise Cheney's claim that the Exclusion law was the reason Oregon  and the UO had such a low percentage of African Americans.

I agree with the conservatives that want to protect religious rights.  The Bible says that the practice of same sex activity is wrong.  It doesn't say being black is a sin or being disabled is a sin.  I agree of protections for most groups because it's not considered a sin.  Christians need protection just as much as LGBT.  I think I'm a bit lost in my thoughts.  I hope someone can understand what I'm trying to say.  Just for general interest there is a website for those people who are liberal Christians:  http://www.thechristianleft.org/"

My parents later told me that they caught a lot of grief (I guess now we would call it abuse) for being nice to them.  They didn't have a car, so my mother would take Woody's mother shopping with her, for example.

Later in life, my father merely said about Woody's father:  ""He fought in the war too.""  

My parents ""signed their names.""

If you are truly worried about being abused or your family being abused, in Langley, please then consider what it would be like for a Syrian child seeking refuge in our country.  Do we give love or do we give hate that is driven by fear?"
"Ah, Mr. Timothy Busch, investor, influencer & overall 'man behind the Catholic curtain,"" organizes a conference at Catholic University. At $2,500 a pop, what did you think the crowd would look like? Black Lives Matter or Wall Street? So, so sad that Mr. Busch declared CU to be a ""perennial partner,"" along with Mr. Koch! Any ideas about protecting laborers in Mr. Koch's businesses, or organizing a labor union at one of his facilities, or the environmental damage he and his brother do to this planet on a weekly basis? Or, to bring it home to Kansas, what their political philosophy has done to the entire state? Oh yes, give him an award and a bottle of wine for his $50M! Unfortunately, his entire political persona is totally removed from the RCC! So, so sad this is what right-wing Catholics will cheer, and cheer, and cheer."

"""most Canadians have an attitude of live and let live..."" And, more to the point, they--and most of us--think so!  

However, I suspect that if you read a list of items to a few of the live-and-let-live advocates among us, you'd quickly experience some ""yes, but"" moments.  The list:

1. Good to let more Muslim refugees in next year.
2. Hey, it's a free market economy!  No government interference in the real estate sector.
3. We gotta take Mosul, and if that means turning ""advising"" Canadian Forces into ""shootin'"" Canadian Forces, so be it. 
4. Legalizing pot is A-OK.
5. Let Black Lives Matter dictate Pride Parade rules. It's racially prejudicial to do otherwise.
6. We shouldn't investigate what Muslim teach in Mosque classes.  It's their right to teach what they want.
7. A very low rate of police department ""unfounded files"" sexual assault files is very good. 

See?  I believe most Canadians pick and choose their live-and-let-live moments--and your moments may not be mine."
Well Black Lives Matter Houston is volunteering - kudos to them.  Meanwhile Antifa Houston is covering a protest in Berkley - people not clear on the concept.
"Criminal laws do not go against human nature, they simply follow natural law, entities that/who violate the societal acceptable standards are punished. The only real societal changes take place at the kitchen table, and the more the government tries to force the issue the worse it gets.
So what you are suggesting with all of these news laws is the blacks can't be trusted to make it on their own without the assistance of central government? This is my question because I know many successful elderly black individuals, being elderly myself, it is the age group I associate with."

"I figured you had read what Kaepernick had to say about it, but since you seem to believe you are the only one who has read the articles or listens to the news, here you go, ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""  

Seriously, I have a right to disagree with how he is protesting the issue, even if I were to agree there are problems. I would never not stand and show appropriate respect to the Flag or National Anthem. However, as I said, I will defend others' rights not to show what I consider appropriate respect under the First Amendment's protections of free speech."
"The problem about Gigaba now is how, as an obviously dishonest and crooked minister, is he going to interact with investors and convince them that South Africa is a good investment destination. How is he going to convince them that their investment will be safe in SA when he, together with his deputy minister, is one of the looters? South Africa is more in trouble than we realise. Right now whatever he says cannot be taken seriously simply because of who he is, no matter how sensible he may sound. The South African economy will remain on a free fall for as long as he is in charge of our fiscus."
"Not who I was expecting- nor I think most folks were though anti-Semitism in the African American community is not unknown. This has always been odd to me as Jewish Americans were at the forefront of the civil rights movement. This guy- as is usually the case , seems more emotionally troubled than anything else. In any event this accounts for less than 10% of the threats and hopefully suspects more to folks liking will be found and arrested."
"North Korea is enemy to only one country - U.S.A. They fought the Koran War of 1952 to a stalemate, still at war technically today. North Korea suffered horrific loss of 3 million dead from American carpet bombing similar to that of WW2. The U.S. 'took it out' on the Koreans after its army of several divisions under Gen. MacArthur was nearly wiped out by Chinese forces after trying to invade China. 

So the U.S. is both enemy of North Korea and China from this war. The U.S. is also enemy of Vietnam in the Vietnam War, and Cambodia and Laos after invading them. 3 million were killed in these 3 Asian countries, add the 3 million of North Korea and you have 6 million Asian dead from American imperial invasions since WW2. That's the same as the Nazi Holocaust on the Jews.

We know how the Vietnam War ended. All the weapons and forces the U.S. used did not win it after more than 12 years of horrific fighting including massive B-52 carpet bombing. 

So let's see Trump start Korean War 2."
"Thanks Ambrose.  That's about 80% of the whole US illegal immigration discussion, or lack thereof.  11 million illegal Mexican immigrants made it to the US over the past 2-3 decades because the upper half of the US socioeconomic distribution was either unaffected by it - illegals aren't competing with college-educated professionals for work - or even benefitted from it - those who hired illegals as nannies, or who hired illegals to do construction or other ""grunt"" jobs.  I'd hate to be on bottom half of the US pecking order over the past few decades.

With well over 40 million legal Americans of Hispanic background, Vicente Fox's cries of ""racism"" are simply absurd."
"Yes they do.  But real ""grown-ups"" do not condone racism and would never have placed an ad like that.  People of all colors can either be real ""grown-ups"" or can be just like these girls."
"If the ""RAIL"" is used, as one example of government financial hemorrhaging, then there will be no end to government spending.

Only government infrastructure issues, should be the governments' concern, over the next few administrations.

You can't keep on spending money, that goes into a financial black hole."
"Pardon me, but...judge much? You know  nothing about people's personal spirituality. Just as one example, Tim Kaine was raised in a devoutly Catholic home, was educated by the Jesuits, served a service year at a Catholic mission in Honduras...he and his wife were married in a poor, predominantly African American parish and have attended Sunday liturgy there for more than thirty years, he is in ministries in his parish and he sings in the choir.  I think that should be enough.  Whenever I see a phrase like ""they are not practicing Catholics"" or ""they don't follow Church teaching"", it says way more about the person who made the statement than it does about those being ""commented"" upon."
"The recount was initiated by democrats under the guise that trump did better in precincts where the machines were electronic than he did where votes were counted by hand.

As for the e-mails leaked - the guy that leaked them, Assange, said it wasn't the russians.  But even if it WAS!  Two things
1) do you really think that dramatically affected the outcome, or do you think dems should have stood behind a candidate the people actually liked, aka Bernie sanders instead of voting for someone they ""thought could win""?
2) what does it matter?  The emails weren't faked, they really happened.  The votes weren't faked, they also really happened.  What exactly is the result you're looking for?  Even if there was a video of trump asking Putin to help him out, (which there won't be) it wouldn't change the election....so...."
"IT was also Harry's ancestors who ended British participation in the transatlantic slave trade . ""Are we not men and brother too"" was the rally cry. Starting in 1779 Britain worked to end slavery and by 1832,  50 years, it was all over, but no thanks for that.  The Arabian slave trade  was in full operation across Africa a 1000 years prior to Europeans,  and continues today  Virtually every Islamic country continues some form of slavery.  But blame Harry's lineage that it happened at all, before and after they were involved.

As soon as Britain ended its participation in slavery  they got richer than ever with the Industrial Revolution. Not a single black man was ever again in British  slave chains, yet you are not pleased by that."
"Did you read the above link about Gorka?  Do you think it is okay for the Trump administration to associate with such a person?  

Moreover, there has been an outbreak of hate crimes and antisemitism since Trump's election.  This includes incidences of people being killed as happened in Kansas City, threats against Jewish community centers, vandalism of Jewish synagogues and the cemeteries, etc.  This all happened after the election and is directly connected to Trump.  Alt-reich bigots certainly feel okay to spread their hate now that Trump is POTUS in away they didn't while Obama was in charge.  

Finally, the Muslim Ban and indiscriminately rounding up Latinos and demanding the papers of dark skinned people do nothing to prevent terrorism or increase law and order.  These are acts of discrimination against minority populations."
"I would point out that the Civil War was about many things: slavery, states' rights, the ongoing economic issues involved in an idustrial North and an agarian South and, of course, the question of secession if a State or States were extremely dissatisfied with being part of the U.S.  I think all of those issues were involved and need to be studied.

The ""major questions"" about evolution.....Simple, it doesn't fit with the conservative Christians' literal interpretation of the Bible.  Those ""major questions"" have nothing to do with the extensive evidence supporting evolution, but are a result of the cognitive dissonance that evidence creates for the ""faithful,"" and, of course, given a choice between denying all that evidence and questioning beliefs you faithfully follow, many conservative Christians have chosen to deny evolution.

It's fine that you ""ended up"" a conservative.  It is also evidence that those schools in the Seattle/Olympia area support free thinking."

The political violence of the 1970's and 1980's, was indeed extreme in some parts of South Africa. However it was not as indiscriminate and restrictive as the violence perpetuated by criminals, who rape and murder grannies and toddlers, engage in violent home invasions, kill and hijack drivers, rob innocent people going through their daily routines etc. People (especially women and children) have become prisoners in their own communities and homes as their movement is restricted by the fear of becoming random victims of the crime wave.  The state is failing our people - that is the real problem!"
"Uh oh.  The Repugnicans are divided between those that want to eff as many poor and needy people as possible, and those who still have some memory of what it was like to be human.

"Sometimes the real meaning of news goes beyond the stories themselves. 

I spotted this story (as, presumably all other commenters did) on the ""Home""  page as a small-font headline under ""World.""  It was easily overlooked, because Xi was overwhelmed by the pontificating President's big photo and the bold, black headline, ""Donald Trump uses inaugural address to outline ""America First"" vision."" 

Don't sneer at the G&M; media knows what's important to the masses. To prove my point, a few minutes ago, Trump's photo and the headline disappeared, replaced by a photo of female protesters (""Dump Trump!"") and the headline, ""Women Descend on Washington...""  

A few days ago, at the World Economic Forum at Davos, ""the most powerful man in the Communist Party"", Xi Jinping was likely making the real history. Our PM wasn't there to hear it...having been persuaded (mostly by angry Canadians) to stay home.  Too bad. Ministers are no substitute for the leader when its time to ""press the flesh."""
"Looker: If you're going to accuse Hillary Clinton of being racist, you really need to link an appropriate reference.

Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. Thus you will know them by their fruits.""

If Trump is the tree, the tree is already diseased, and the fruit that has so far been borne (his cabinet picks) are already showing signs of disease. Frankly, I don't care how many correct church boxes these cabinet picks check, by their fruits we shall know them and those of us who did not vote for the diseased tree will be watching and waiting to see what kind of fruit they bear in terms of policy. I doubt much of it will be anything of which Jesus would approve. But we shall see. And we shall comment accordingly."

And to make it even more senseless, to say that Canada can afford these additional debts without impacts on future govt revenues and services.

And that we are in the present distressed state exactly because we have been living on debt financing for the past 45 years.

"Election results become, at best, confusing when you factor in the depressing reality that over 40% of eligible voters didn't vote at all.  The confusion is compounded with the Electoral College win for Trump but popular vote majority going to Clinton.

Yes, one cannot possibly give an overview of Canadian history, or any other history, in a few hours, while including every possible group and detail. 

Maybe the problem is trying to cover all of Canadian history in a single series.

 The US, as pointed out, has a whole industry cranking out detailed historical documentaries on every aspect of American history: whole multi-episode series just on the Civil War, or the Black Experience, etc. We would need to do the same, i.e. one series on each different region and period, etc., for all possible viewpoints and details to be fully represented."

You accuser the ""liberal media"" of neglecting this issue. Have you seen coverage of the famine from the ""conservative media"" which gets the majority of airtime, viewer hours, and talk radio exposure? I haven't. But I have seen coverage of the drought-caused famiine in South Sudan and the Horn of Africa, which are also VERY dangerous for anyone, let alone a Westerner, to go to and survive to tell the story. If those famines, whether caused deliberately by Saudi Arabia or by Mother Nature, held the attention of as many viewers as Trump and his family do, then we would see more news and discussion about it. Trump has now had 215 days in office to demand an end to the Yemen famine, which he could do. But instead, Trump has kissed the king's ring."

"There is no inconsistency.  I don't celebrate laws or this law, I support it.  It is wrong to legislate morality because it ends up with greater injustice.  Adultery is a serious wrong and it should not be a crime.  Idolatry is the most serious sin a person can commit but it should not be a crime in the U.S.  

We don't prohibit murder, theft, discrimination against blacks and women as a matter of morality but of public equality for all citizens which enables the public peace to be kept more readily.  We don't criminalize adultery because it would not cure the problem any more than illegalizing abortion has lessened abortion rates in any countries where it is illegal - it has in fact given these countries higher rates of abortion in almost every case.

There is a reason to have governmental laws to keep the peace and allow an even playing field for all citizens.  Churches have a higher criteria for morality as to what constitutes sin as this should be based on Gospel to gain salvation."

"I an see the basis for your reactions, but it certainly lacks any appreciation for the actual situation in which these people find themselves.  We are talking about an impoverished, barely developing African country that is torn apart by civil unrest and outright war.  Each day brings a distinct possibility of death.  It is near impossible for us to actually grasp the intensity of such a life, but if one really does believe in Jesus Christ, each of us can make a leap in understanding granted by Him.  It seems you have not yet grasped that essential part of being Christian, Rompecorazones.

"New to debate. Right.

I assumed you were, but I now see you're in over your head.  

As for refutation:  Your broad point was that illegal immigration is good for our economy.  My counter-point, citing Borjas, was that illegal immigration lowers the wages of the American poor.  You had no come-back, for the most part, but said only that ""the current unemployment rate is so low ... that any one who wants to work is working.""  That's false.  Unemp for black teens is 21%; for women over 50, finding a job is very difficult; for high-school drop-outs, unemp is about 7%.  About 14 million people who want work are unemployed."

Why is it the only thing you know about India is the caste system? The only time it was legal was under the British Rule. At that point, there was apartheid in India - European only schools, hotels, streets, etc. They didn't mind if there was discrimination among Indians.

As soon as India became independent, caste discrimination was outlawed. Whereas in Hong Kong, Africa, the USA, and other British colonies practiced apartheid for centuries. In Hong Kong, till the 1990s, there were EUropean only schools, neighbourhoods, clubs etc. In the USA, till the 1960s, segregation was legal. Interracial marriage was illegal. And so on."

Furthermore, if the Chinese have achieved what you say they have.....what is the cost?  Political prisoners.  A muzzled media.  Slave labour.  Torture.

Intermittent, unexpected violence in Europe, in places where I might actually travel, is both shocking and relevant to me for good reason. The fact that I pay more attention doesn't mean I dismiss the value of brown or black lives."
"Response to Tim Osman --
 I was a staunch Bernie Sanders supporter. In February I wrote the following:
 ""It is more important to me to see a President such as Bernie Sanders, who truly cares about people.  Hillary Clinton was part of the 'you get two for one'; therefore, it is disingenuous for her to separate herself from Bill Clinton's  suppressive racist policies, such as 'ending welfare as we know it', support of the death penalty as well as a tremendous increase of Blackmen in the prison system for non-violent drug crimes...Yes, it would be simply wonderful to have a woman president, but clearly not Hillary. Someone more like Elizabeth Warren, a woman who truly cares about people and doesn't blow with the wind...The president needs to reflect what is in the best interest of America's citizens, not corporate America's interests.""

Once Hillary became the Democrat nominee there was no choice between this Centrist-Democrat and a racist, misogynistic, xenophobic fool.

"I see your points. I the media has been largely against Trump. But a question raised is whether the media has the authority to determine a claim is a lie. 
Up to now, most media has shied away from that. Trump got five years media access to all but call Obama a Negro born in Africa. I never remember any media saying that is a lie. Trump's recent admission at least means he spread a falsehood - he lied.
Lawrence O'Donnell recently noted the liberal NY Times fell into this trap. Times: ...""in selling his case, Mr. Trump stretched the truth, saying ... Hillary Clinton, has no such plan of her own [for childcare] and “never will.”  But then they wrote ...""Clinton issued her plan more than a year ago...it guarantees up to 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave for a newborn."" Stretching the truth or a lie?
Chris Christie recently said Trump has not pushed the birther argument for 5 years, but we have tapes of Trump going to 2011. CNN said this was false. Why can't the media note this?"
"These are councilmembers that have attempted to pass legally binding contracts and Ordinances that have not undergone Legal review.  Contracts and Ordinances with illegal provisions within them.  This is neither smart governance, nor smart personal business practice!  This is not a matter of the Developer trying to get electeds to quit, this is someone finally stepping up to the legal plate to hold these three legally accountable for their illegal actions!  Thank goodness we have Checks and Balances with a Strong Mayor form of government in Black Diamond."
"You assume incorrectly. I have do have a problem with the Confederate flag being displayed. It's a symbol of treasonous stubborn immoral defense anti-black race-based inter-generational slavery. I also have problems with the Nazi flag being displayed. It's a symbol of racism and antisemitism. 

The American flag on the other hand is a symbol of a nation that always seeks to be perfected. Not a perfect nation, not an ""exceptional"" nation, but one that strives to move forward. A nation that strives toward liberty and justice for all, not just some. Protest is one means of perfecting the nation. Mindless allegiance to the status quo doesn't result in positive change.

The one silver lining with seeing the racist Confederate flag is that it lays bare the racist inner mind of the Confederate flag waver. It's pretty telling what kind of person would still pledge allegiance to the racist anti-black Confederate flag in 2017."
"Israel's treatment of the Palestinian's is consistent with their treatment by other Arabs which they enjoyed without complaint. Egypt and Jordan treated with the same respect as Israel. In fact, Israel treats them better as Black September in Jordan would demonstrate. So what's the beef?"
"WA STATE = fish n wildlife care less if black bear are in your yard or destroying your property.
Then they make up McSticticks. About deaths, mauling. So game on. Bears gotta go. 
Of course if they were in any far left politicians back yard? The entire bear trapping Mc$quad would be OUT THERE IN FULL FORCE. Trapping and removing Yogi and BooBoo."
"Heh.  RR never makes a legitimate point when it comes to black folks.  I've followed his rather checkered 'commenting career' for a while.  Saw him go completely apoplectic when a black lady talked back to him once.  Actually said he wanted to 'put her in her place.'

But my question to you is, was there ever a black Anchorage Assembly chairperson before Ms. Gray-Jackson?  No?  Then neither yours nor Richard the Rhino-headed's objection has any merit whatsoever.  First time.  It's noteworthy.  Get over it."
"Yesterday wasn't a choke. As Black said, it was just a good baseball game. The day before was a choke."
"I call this Fake Comment.

There is nothing at all to suggest what you have said is true.

Trump has said time and time again he wants to make African American communities better, starting by building infrastructure in the inner cities, reducing crime, and putting jobs in these cities.  

He wants to help all people of all races.

I feel sorry for you in buying into the SJW and MSM non-sense."
Because a birth certificate was demanded for the very first time when an African American ran for president.  That assumption is pure and simple racism.
"I believe there is enough history of the leaders and those who primarily organize the protest under the banner of Black Lives Matters have clearly one objective which is meant to be as racially divisive as possible. I would note not every individual who attends the protest organized by BLM are willfully minded to be racially divisive, but it is a rather very poor group to be associated with."
"It wasn't the fault of the OSC. Several prominent Americans of high net worth exposed Home Capital Group and with mounting evidence the OSC had no choice otherwise. Much the same happened with Conrad Black as we recall, the Americans exposed him as Canada tried their best to keep it all hush, hush."
"Facebook revealed on Sept. 6 that it had found 470 pages and profiles linked to the Russian troll farm known as the Internet Research Agency.


Some of those fake accounts posted comments here, no doubt.  Some are still posting here and elsewhere.

Facebook on Monday turned over more than 3,000 of the Russia-linked advertisements from its site over to the Senate and House intelligence committees.

The ads and accounts were created to push false information and lies in order to amplify divisive political issues across the political spectrum, including gun rights, gay rights issues and the Black Lives Matter movement.

When you read repetitive right wing talking points and myths, consider their source.  Much of their narrative is created and crafted by our enemies."
"Look at Black Lives Matter for why some  well-meaning people have turned off trying to address some of the injustices that genuinely exist, and have just tuned out ."
"What you write here is true in some areas, untrue in others, and sometimes true all over.  It takes time to produce those Congars and Rahners and Kungs and Newmans and Orsys and a Rausch and a Johnson and so on.  The issues of intellectually unprepared clerics, for example, is true of those in the Philippines, some parts of Africa and India as well, but that is not an unknown and the bishops conferences in those countries are starting to focus on the issue (Cardinal Tagle, for one, is very concerned about it).   I am more positive about our crops of ministers, both men and women, and the great influx of the laity in the roles of ministers and theologians and canonists.  This is why most religious are not overly concerned about our future: we see emerging models of new health and strength and spirituality, and a breaking free of the church-imposed shackles places on so many (women and the laity).   There is much to be hopeful for."
"Feeling a bit harsh today, aren't we.  Ms. Shurtz made an error in judgment.  Clearly she had no malicious intent. IMO, it's the malicious intent of true racism, discrimination, and hate speech which is so despicable. If you feel Ms Shurtz is a person who  ""deserve(s) to have their (her) careers destroyed and ruined, "" what would you suggest should happen to someone who wears ""blackface"" to intentionally mock and belittle African Americans?  The ""stock"" in the public square? A public flogging? Stoning? Banishment?.....wait, this is what her colleagues feel, and, it seems,  you feel should happen to her.  

Let me stick my neck out here: a) be clear, I'm not ""defending"" her actions.....nor am I defending racism.....far from it.  b) however, I strongly feel all parties would benefit if those persons harmed could find it ""in their hearts"" to forgive.  The homily says ""To err is human, to forgive is Divine.""  How about it?"
"""Prepare to Defend""- Anyone else ever heard that? To begin, black powder was made by ancient Chinese. It was a ""toy"" for fireworks. The they put it down the barrel and shazam, firearms! A better way to ""defend."" Nuclear fission was discovered and it had all kinds of applications...we made a bomb. Again, to ""defend."" Criminals have guns, invading army's have guns, rogue cops have guns and out of control governments have guns. (Waco). Lo and behold, an implement to, ya, you guessed it. ""Defend!"" WAKE UP!!"
"As I said before it is a Mass, not a service. Reverence, prayer and quiet reflection  during the Mass and in the pews.   Save the chatter for  the coffee hour after the Mass.   I thought we were discussing the Baptist Church, but  I see you mentioned the Black Catholic communities.  Sing with the choir and pray as loud as you like, but shut up during the rest of the Mass.  Talk to God, not your neighbor in the pew. You have plenty of time to converse with your neighbor outside the Church."
"True Will ...the US was generally on the side of civil rights ...but the democrats weren't and still aren't.

""History reveals that every piece of racist legislation that was ever passed and every racist terrorist attack that was ever inflicted on African Americans, was initiated by the members of the Democratic Party. From the formation of the Democratic Party in 1792 to the Civil Rights movement of 1960's, Congressional records show the Democrat Party passed no specific laws to help Blacks, every law that they introduced into Congress was designed to hurt blacks in 1894 Repeal Act. The chronicles of history shows that during the past 160 years the Democratic Party legislated Jim Crows laws, Black Codes and a multitude of other laws at the state and federal level to deny African Americans their rights as citizens.""

"Why is it that when a group of people who are right of center want to practice free speech, we need police with riot gear to protect their free speech? 

Apparently the people on the left who were protesting this free speech were clad in black? They probably thought they were fighting against fascism ironically by using fascist tactics as they've done on many college campuses - especially at Berkeley."
Thanks to the Liberals like Wavemaker and Neato Neil Black.
"Once again, Mr/Ms Milbank has put together a list worded to make the President sound quilty of all he/she purports. For example, if a Democrat Pres had come in and fired an FBI Director who had clear ties with R's and had lied to Congress, the press would have praised his/her good sense!  Dems never get this kind of treatment in the press.  When they hold up someone like FDR as one of their icons, the press never reminds them that it was FDR who ordered Japanese Americans into internment camps or that their party voted against getting rid of ""lynching"" of Americans who were black.  

Find a subject, and try to do some impartial research and inform the readers, if you can, please!"
"Irrationalist, no one is asking for proprietary rights in any formal sense. But aboriginals DO have a right to speak out and argue that non-natives should keep their mitts off their stories. It's their political, cultural opinion and they are entitled to it. Argue with the substance of that opinion and consider deleting your racist aside about the 'civilized world.' Your false, paternalistic argument ignores that people have always argued about who gets to say what in art and in what way. Women authors were once derided, black writers too of course, and militaristic victors get to write the history books AND the culture stuff too until oppressed populations write back. Your view that it's all supposed to be an apolitical sharing party is naive. And btw, culturally oblivious appropriation writers do not 'build on common knowledge'--the point the column makes is that they distort, marginalize, and insult. Watch the documentary Reel Indian and check your privilege. I did. It didn't hurt."
"If they were marching with the old Soviet hammer-and-sickle flag and pictures of Stalin and Che, then you would have an argument to label the activists you mentioned as ""extreme left"". (Although I'm guessing you meant groups like Black Lives Matter when referring to ""radical racial groups"" and you will need to explain to me what you consider a radical feminist.) ""Left"" or ""progressive"" will suffice. They're not like the anarchists that sometimes show up at marches and do property damage."
"I've practiced Islam for a few years, and while I no longer follow their teachings I'd like to share my opinion on the issue.

The Quran asks only for modesty on the part of woman in Islam. I'm not even sure if the 'hijab' is even mentioned in the book. How 'modest' is modest is partly up for debate: Jordan has adopted western values, and there's a decent number of Muslim woman who don't wear hijabs.

Yes, there's some that wear hijabs by choice, and that's fine. However, we can't really see behind closed doors so whose to say she wears one because she wants to or because of the fear of being shunned by a traditional Muslim family? 

I know my mother is still seen as an outcast by other family members, the ""black sheep"", when she abandoned her headscarf a decade ago. She doesn't mind it though, and loves being complimented. She still practices Islam, but I've only ever heard her complain about western society's cold weather, parking tickets, and electricity bills."
"Wow, I just got one STRANGE warning from the ""Civil Comments"" system.

Up popped one of the posts I was supposed to assess for suitability.

The post said something like this:

""Islam as described in the Koran can never be satisfied until Islam has overtaken infidel beliefs worldwide - as described in the Koran it is an expansionist ideology that requires preeminent status and so you might as well start learning more about its features sooner rather than later"".

Well, I voted that the post was okay and was civil, and WHAM!, my whole webpage went black and these big words in an angry-looking red font came up saying something like ""WARNING: YOU HAVE FAILED TO REJECT A POST THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE REJECTED, YOU MUST EMPLOY MORE SCRUTINY AND SINCERITY IN YOUR ASSESSMENT EFFORTS"".

Um, hello?
Seriously, hello?

How was the guy's post uncivil? For crying out loud, I could provide quotes by Winston Churchill that were a LOT more harsh on Islam than that post! Shall we ban Churchill quotes?"
"My generation during Lent used to fill little cans with dimes to 'ransom pagan babies' and we were taught that every person not Catholic, unless led by their own long-ancestral roots in a Protestant religion, had a ticket to Hell.  No one mentioned, at least to me, the ultimate destination of inhabitants of  countries with multiple gods to appease.  

I'm sure there is a seed of ""truth"" in every expression sincerely seeking God, but since God alone is Truth, we'll NEVER know it all as we're simply not God.  Maybe since the Reformation...or maybe since long, long before organized, routinized, mandated Christianity, people clung to their own culture in living their lives.  It seems to me what we're dealing with is simply culture -- not dogma, not the Magisterium, not even Tradition -- but simply ways people feel more comfortable relating to the numinous as it speaks to them.  Why are unity and uniformity so freaking important it has caused pogroms, wars, inhumane acts and all this angst?"
"""the lessons we’ve learned from the centuries when our biblical texts were used to justify slavery, discrimination, segregation and oppression of people of color and women,”
*
In regards to slavery, the bible never justified it.  In the context of a world in which slavery was everywhere, it tried to make it a little better, to impose some rules.  It was also the foundation for getting rid of slavery.
*
As for oppression of women, the same thing.  In the world of Paul and Jesus, where physical realities imposed roles on which survival depended, the bible exhorts husbands and wives to subject themselves to each other. 
* 
As for same-sex marriage,  it is a biblical oxymoron.  This is not to say that the federal government should not support the idea of a gender-free partner contract.  But to assume that this is somehow the same as that of a man and a wife, the biological basis for the procreation of the human race, and the idea of a marriage known to Jesus, is delusional."
"According to this site, there are only nine (9) black students at the U of O Law School.  I can see why they would tire of questions from very many of the other 357 law students or 67 faculty, much less the rest of the University of Oregon.

Of course, with 16% of the Law School faculty being part of a minority, a few of them ought to have a clue.  

And ""The faculty of University of Oregon School of Law is 53% women, one of the highest percentages of female faculty across all law schools (average: 41%)."" 

So gender bias ought to be understood by some of the faculty as well and give some insight.

Some of the modest swimwear is also very cute.  I learned about it from a plus-size friend, but I'm sure it's available in all sizes.  I'm too pale to ever go into the water unprotected, so I wear a dive skin.  It's black.  Would the French arrest me too?"
"The same people who tell us being afraid of Islamic terrorism is ""irrational"" because it is so rare we have a better chance of getting killed slipping in the bathtub, etc., are displaying irrational fear of the probability of another Bissonnette, which is even less likely.

"If Republicans are so racist, why did they nominate a black man, Daryl Glenn, to run for Senate in Colorado?  Or vote for Tim Scott (So. Carolina) to take a Senate seat?  

In one Sat. morning in October, I heard Coleen Hanabusa state to Mike Buck and Gary Galligher (now deceased) that Republicans were against Obama because he was black.  That kind of thinking is called ""projection"" and indicates the speaker is actually stating their own prejudice by throwing it on their opponents."
"Levin is writing from a libertarian/individualist perspective and is blind to the existence of other world views.  Many economists also share this blindnerss.  He sees the egalitarian movements of the sixties and seventies-as well as the hierarchist/authoritarian movements on the right (such as the Moral Majority and the pro-life movement) as actions of individuals.  They are much more than that.  The civil rights movement still lives in the SCLC and Black Lives Matter.  Occupy is a quntessential egalitarian movement as is the gay rights movement.  He is blind to the nature of collective action, however, so he misses a lot."
"Either Republican or Democrat will run our state into the ground and eventually the Feds will come in and take it over. That is the direction it is heading to.

Folks it's common sense, if you had more of that you would realize it and make a change. 
   Maybe we need just an ordinary person to run for office. Someone who is a Real person. One who has genuine love for the state of Alaska and will find others who have the same attitude as they do and turn this state around. Back to what it once was. We all can make adjustments and come out in the black. Someone who will spend our states budjet like it's coming out of their own bank account. 
   Alaska, if we don't do something in all the future election, we are going to be bailed out by the Feds like other staes are in the lower 48. then they will set our regulations."

"And who's going to pay for hundreds of thousands of people to go through detox? And what's the plan after that? They'll still have access to street drugs.
The first thing we need is to stabilize the population and stop them from dying. The simplest, cheapest and most effective way--by far--would be to legalize and regulate the sale of these drugs.
This would destroy the black market drug trade, dramatically reduce policing, first response and other health-associated costs, and bring users out of the criminal realm so that they have no reason to fear getting the help they need.
Then we can develop a national health strategy to help people get off drugs... funded in whole or in part by the reduction in costs mentioned above."
"I began to quickly doze off when he got into the abstract writing of B16. Maybe Cupich could have b16 come to Chicago, at least via Skype and explain his distinctions. 
As a native of Chicago's Southside, the effects of the progressive Cardinal Mundelein et al had zero impact on the parish I grew up in.  In fact, the opposite was operative - racism. A half block from me, a couple had a union meeting of people in their home; a few were black.  Quickly, over 1,000 people, overwhelmingly parishioners, took to the street.  Eventually, the owners had to move; the parish bought the house.  So much for progressive Catholicism. Never once did I hear a word of race reconciliation, publicly or privately by the clergy.
Interesting the Cupich has done an about face on Pfleger. George tried to drum him out of the RCC.
He's the last RC cleric who gives a damn about what is happening still in Chicago's huge ghetto."

"Thank you, Mike. The fact that there was no ""legal framework"" for slavery in Virginia in most of the first half of the 17th century, only indentured servitude, doesn't mean the conditions and brutality were not indistinguishable from slavery elsewhere in the Americas.  In addition, those first Africans were taken as slaves by Europeans, and they arrived with no ability whatsoever to determine their own fate.  Their work was brutal, as would be the work and suffering of future slaves in the south. To say that they were not slaves, but indentured servants, is to give full weight, again, to only one side of event, the European side, the side of magical labels, the side that forces all understanding through a single, limited worldview.  I'm pretty sure the Africans couldn't tell much difference between the two states, especially given that they were captured into slavery, not indentured servitude."

"According to today's (radical) feminist theory, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"" is outrageous.

Tom Robinson would have be guilty - not because he of racism and he was black - but sexism in that he's the man and the woman must be believed.

Why?  Women are always truthful when they cry rape - no women ever lies or has other motives or is ""mistaken in her mind.""  That's a reductive and highly chauvinist view if you think about it - the girl is always the damsel-in-distress pursued by a Dastardly Whiplash.

To be clear, it's terrible that actual rapes go unpunished.  But sadly, such is the he said-she said nature of much of these crimes.  Better ten guilty go free than punish one innocent person, as the proverb goes.  And better not put your thumb on the scale of justice to excuse relevant texts and tweets from the complainant."
"Not intended as a strawman, merely an analogy:

Woman crosses the border into the U.S. She wants her kids to have a better life. She gets caught. However, this time the kids won't suffer from her illegal behavior because some citizens want to ""give her a pass"" on her crime.
.
I don't define myself as racist because my godfather is a first-generation Mexican immigrant and one of my roommates is the son of legal Mexican immigrants and two of my cousins are half black. Regardless of that, I think that anyone who breaks the law should suffer the consequences. I understand that innocent children will also suffer, but they need to blame their mother and not the American immigration system."

Sad irony is that Lai's skin color is about the same as many African Americans who have lighter black skin.  It is agreed Hawaiians have been dealt a bad deal over a hundred years ago but to propagate hate and anger from generation to generation does more harm than good.  It is not lack of money to improve the life of Hawaiians when KSBE & OHA together are worth BILLIONS yet their focus is making maximum profits building million dollar condos for outside investors.  How about use the money &  land they sit on & develop truly affordable housing for Hawaiians.  Not like the Homestead program where they wait decades before getting housing.  Hoopili will nothing more than a urban sprawl but what if they had used that land to build mini farms/homes at a loss to the KSBE/OHA or whoever and made it a Hawaiian community that give them a place and identity.  Also education is key & continue to teach them Hawaiian culture but Western education as well.  Teaching hate has serious consequences..

Ask yourself if the blacks and Hispanics are any better off for giving their votes to Democrats year after year?  Don't believe the polls for one second either.  You had best prepare to call in sick on November 9th since you will be too drunk to drive with all of your sorrow over President Trump's massive victory!
"""Oregon's racist past"" is not a sacred cow it is a dead cow.  There is nothing anyone can do about the past which is why the productive people do not dwell on it.  People today are not responsible for the actions of people from long ago.  Wise and intelligent people focus on actions that actually hurt a person as in damage body, possessions, career, etc.  Black make-up does none of those.  Yet to fire Shurtz hurts her profoundly.  To publicly denounce her has likely hurt her to the core.  Those who put PC over the real impact to a person are not good people.  They are hypocrites blind to the adverse effects of their own actions.  As far as donations, the permanent endowment fund I created at the U of O foundation has over $100,000. in it.   Needless to say, I no longer contribute."
Was Hillary there with a black robe and witch hat?
"It nothing to do with being black. He was a secular Socialist dictator skirting the congress and the Constitutional at every turn by using un-elected heads of agencies to change laws of he country away from freedom and free market to socialist nanny-state control. Only what he wanted/believed mattered...part of the Def. of a ""Dictator"""
"Statistically, in classrooms it isn't so much the black kids who bring the guns and bombs for show and tell (shhh... It's those others)."
"IRT Gerrit Osborne: The maroons in local government think the movie ""Idiocracy"" is a training guide."
"sorry, but this was hilarious, and i've been riding this storm out with everyone else in houston. half my family back in north texas is this exact trope, and it's very real. that's not exaggerating at all, and while they dont live here in houston, other cities hit by the floodwaters have plenty of these guys. both them, and the thousands in houston (backwoods or not) are praising jesus for saving them. it's ridiculous, and rude to those risking their lives to save them. this is a big, destructive storm. god is not here, but volunteers are. the government is. jesus isnt going to help, you have to save yourself. if there is anything spiritual about this, maybe its the notion of natural selection. the smart will be fine, the stupid are too dumb to put their stuff in some boxes and listen to the news warnings."
"nonsense.
There was 10% unemployment when the black guy was inaugurated.

Now there is full employment 
............... and 80,000,000 Americans couldn't even take 6 hours off work to vote."
"Eugenean:  When we are together we refer to each other by our First Names.   I believe that the Black people that are not educated are the ones that are the most ""RACIST"".   What then?????     We have to put up with all of the lawsuits."
"Roy, you are wrong once again.  Trump has threatened military action against ISIS, but NEVER made any threats against any foreign nation.  If you (mistakenly and/or disingenuously) would argue otherwise, please provide the quotes.

You really seem to have a problem putting words into President-elect Trump's mouth, don't you?  But I guess we have to give you a pass on that, as it was only the same tactic used by the entire corporate media throughout the campaign --- ""racist"", ""homophobic"", ""hates women"", ""hates Hispanics"", ""hates blacks"", etc. etc. etc.  The man is many things --- narcissistic, crude, lewd,  and vulgar --- but I do not see where he has ever made any direct statements such as you incessantly and dishonestly ascribe to him."
"Well said.

They are ""poster children"" of the violent so-called ""black lives matter"" and Antifa groups."
"Actually, it's not just the ACA. A large portion of the alt-right are so freaked out we actually had a black president that they are trying to
destroy every vestige of his administration. They want to pretend it never happened."
"It's not BLM's party! A group of radical professional activists who called Trudeau a terrorist. They have no credibility and act like spoiled children who stomp their feet and plug their ears when they don't get candy. Pride has capitulated to threats of direct action and in doing so have severely damaged their reputation as an inclusive organization. BLM have hijacked Pride for their own self-serving agenda. Also, it's not like there aren't black police officers in Toronto... you're embarrassing yourself, BLM's antics should not be rewarded. The event should be changed to the Pride by BLM - as it's clear they dictate who can and cannot attend and Pride goes along to get along."
"You are not unique “Thor”.  You are a perfect example of the gun culture & how coddled you all are.  So easy to play you to get you to namecalling other people who don’t share your opinion.  You pride yourself on calling yourself s Christian but you call me a “clown”.  Jesus is so proud you lost your composure. 
If you believe in an individual right, then have the courage to show us all the evidence thereof.  Also explain to us why black slaves never were afforded your mythical right."
"Black Lives Matter is definitely not a group concerned with dignity.  One only has to look at their ""rallies"" that involve shouting down those who disagree, and rioting, and destruction of property (usually affecting predominantly black neighborhoods).  Church leaders need to call an evil organization what it really is."
"Exactly. If not guided properly, blacks destroy everything they touch. Just look at the third-world dump South Africa has turned into post-apartheid. Then look at the rest of Afreak post-colonia."
Lewis is a POLITICIAN and if Lewis enters the political arena he deserves everything he gets by Trump. What does the MLK holiday and his arrest 50 years have to do with what the old dinosaur says now? If Lewis doesn't want unwanted attention on all the poverty and black on black murders in his Georgia district then he should zip his mouth.
"Hey, he could be declared unfit before the election.  Every day he gets  wilder.  I don't see your list as being enough if he does make it.  You made some good points but how can he win without blacks, Hispanics, women?  The nude pics of his wife with another chick should have rattled his evangelical base but then again, maybe not.  Lol."
"Odd.  Sanctions were o.k. against South Africa (because they discriminated against black people).  They're o.k. against Russia (because they grabbed Crimea).  They're o.k. against Iran (because they might--or might not--be building nuclear capability).  They're o.k. against North Korea (because they're just plain nuts).  If you're the US, they're o.k. against Cuba (because they have a different political system and refused to bow down in obeisance to their American Masters).  So if they're applied against Israel, why are they automatically rejected as ""anti-semitic"" (which is itself an inaccurate designation, as many Arabic people are also semites)?   Sanctions and other more severe measures are warranted against aggression and apartheid, whether based on race, religion, or any other slice-and-dice, and irrespective of whether or not the aggressors were, in the past, victims of others' aggression.  Israel must be measured by the same rules applied to everyone else."
"Yeah right! Sexist, homophobic, anti-Semitic, anti-black attitudes in the military have been prevalent for decades, often encouraged and promoted by the upper rank officers.  It's always ""we'll take care of it"" excuse AFTER one scandal or another happens but it always is swept under the rug (well, they can afford a gigantic rug with the budget they have). Let's face it, the job of the military is to groom killing machines, and that means getting the best bunch of goons together with a singular purpose of destroying things and killing other human beings. Don't think sensitivity training is in the training manual."
"Your suggestion that Mr. Dalton is a member of the Black Riders is disingenuous Bill Hooper 651 as nothing in his posts indicates that he supports anything radical but if he did there'd be nothing wrong with that. I support the aims of the Black Riders. I'm a radical. Radicalism has a long history in the United States, and without it, American democracy would be weaker. William Lloyd Garrison, the famous abolitionist was an American radical as was Mary Wollstonecraft. Both were patriotic Americans who improved the lives of Americans and made the United States the great country--contrary to what Trump supporters claim-- that it is. Your ignorance doesn't scare me. I doubt it scares anyone."
"Apparently none of them realize that thousands of Latinos, Blacks, Asians, LGBT's, and other minorities, including more tha 50% of the women voted for Trump. Poor little snowflakes, luckily it's cold outside or they would melt. But hey spring will be here soon enough."
"Is there a quota?  Some affirmative action requirement?  What is it based on?  Percentage of people in Eugene?  Oregon?  
Are there important sub-sets like Black-female-bi-sexual?"
Exactly she is black I don't see her getting out any time soon
"Unfortunately for Trump, Rudy Giuliani, a vicious racist himself, exposed the dishonesty behind the White House's claim that the travel ban is not religiously biased when he came out and described how the White House had come to him for help in disguising a Muslim ban as something else. The argument that the ban couldn't be anti-Muslim because it doesn't cover all Muslim countries is as absurd as saying that Giuliani, as mayor of NYC, wasn't biased against African-Americans because he didn't discriminate against African-Americans in Los Angeles too."
"I wish there were honest media sources not driven by ideology.

What happened in Portland is definitely terrible and I don't believe that every crime by refugees or muslims needs to be published by all local papers. Sexual assault by three refugees against a 5 year old stands out but it feeds  the side of the immigration debate not supported by the DP.

The DP ignores most of the approximately 280 murders every week, but they put this one on the top page. The DP controls the narrative by highlighting certain stories and ignoring others. 

I used these two stories as examples, but their are many others. Do you recall the baby in Georgia shot in the face by two young, black men? If you only read the DP you didn't hear that story. That was horrific but the DP and others won't cover those stories because it doesn't fit their chosen narrative. Conservative sites are as bad, only differing on their preferred narrative. They highlight crime by immigrants and minorities, equally dishonest."
"Wow, imagine if Trump said this, all you lock step HRC supporters would use it as proof of Trumps prejudism.

""In her support for the 1994 crime bill, for example, she used racially coded rhetoric to cast black children as animals. “They are not just gangs of kids anymore,” she said. “They are often the kinds of kids that are called ‘super-predators.’ No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.”"
"So, I guess the future of hockey is for its athletes to become the physically gifted but arrogant, spoiled children that dominate basketball, football and baseball.

So far removed from everyday life and people, athletes in those sports, mostly black, move in  a world where normal rules and decorum do not exist. Scowling ""gangsta"" athletes, with their entourages, vapor trails of abandoned kids and wives, and quickly diminishing bank accounts in their post playing days.

Yes, that may well be the future of hockey. No more ""aw shucks"" humility, fake or not.

I'll pass."
"Great description of the Democratic Party of today. Particularly their expertise at fraudulent elections entwined in corruption and cronyism. How else did they do such a dismal job in the Ghettos, retain power while the Blacks murder each other, have little education or job opportunity.  Hillary, scapegoating election loss to Russia which I think is pretty well debunked. Probaby their own IT guys. Oh yeah  the Clinton man on the inside Comey. Even the media???? Eruptions on the moon??/ Ha, Ha? Wanting to control the Catholic Church. Protect the Military Complex and Arms industry by promoting war with Russia. Disdain for Right to Life!  Wanted to go on a fetus late term  murdering spree so fully developed fetuses could fetch a better price for Black blood and baby parts!"
"Mr/Ms so-called Brown,
I did not say anything about Latino nannies. Now did you come up with that kind of detail? Hmm.  

You speak of an integrated school, but from your statement it is clear that you are fine with any or all neighborhood families being thrown out of Ainsworth (""redistricted"") so long as you are not affected.  The worst kind of hypocrite is the one that does not even realize it.

BTW I am brown, so don't bring your racist BS argument here. Can you reconcile your statement with the fact that the Ainsworth SI program has so few minorities? Why are you so opposed to making the program more inclusive?"
Nothing like a little black comedy to lift one's spirits. LOL
"No:
For many decades, the right have been telling anyone that would listen the answer to a responsible government was to do away with the lawyers, technocrats and the ""social workers"" and instead put business people in charge. ............ 
Then the fools put the ""First MBA President"" in Charge,  then 9/11 happened, then Katrina, then the US economy totally tanked after Republicans cut ""red tape""..............
................. and then a black guy was brought in clean up the mess"
"Like I said, if he wanted his message heard loud and clear, there were better times to do it.  Instead, as you can see the message is now confused.   Is he a traitor that hates his country or is he someone that is fighting for justice?   That is the discussion that is before us.  A charge he could easily have avoided if he had not chosen to disrespect the flag.   He also, like BLM, chose to put it into racial terms, when it did not need to be.   Nobody of any color should be shot unarmed by the police for no reason.   Or are you and Kaep racist enough to think that only black lives matter."
"There is a stigma being black.   I don't think there is anything that has happened that allows you to call BLM 

""https://duckduckgo.com/q=Lisa+Fithian+who+led+Seattle+anarchists+a+few+years+ago%2C+who+was+also+involved+with+Ferguson&atb=v1&ia=web"" 

 I put in your comment and every single link was far right blogs or news sites like Fox.  I've discovered that mindsets that are similar is useless to hold discussions.  Yours IS bigger than mine.  Your ex of houses burning and you would protect yours BUT BLM house you are blind to the burn.  

Moving on here......."
"Not necessarily.  Businesses can be very tricky in these matters.  At least, they are with women, blacks, older people, etc."
"0.013 per cent Black; 0.078 per cent Hispanic;  and 0.135 all other minorities.  And so the headline reads ""Black Lives Matter"".    Apparently they matter more than all the other minorities for some reason."
"Yes, it's the left that is showing bigotry towards Muslims, it is the left that insists on ""religious liberty"" that translates to ""I have the liberty to tell you how to live your life"", it is the left that makes racism almost respectable. Or am I having trouble telling left from right?"
"Don't fool yourself, it is everywhere.  Canadians may not be as overtly racist as our neighbours to the South of us but we still have many prejudices and misgivings about visible minorities and this racism tends to manifest itself in many forms, some subtle and others not so much.  You may not see it because perhaps you do not practice it or at least you do not suffer as a result of it but it is there.  For many visible minorities, especially blacks, you have the feeling of constantly being under a microscope and that even the slightest perception of a transgression on your behalf will be dealt with is a disproportionately harsh manner by your peers and superiors.

Even if you take away the racist perspective, in the workplace Canadians are incredibly adept at the use of backstabbing to either gain favour or move forward.  I think that this is a social construct which we probably inherited from the British."
What bigotry or racism? We are talking about illegal aliens/ undocumented persons illegally in the country to stop black swans nonsense. Last I checked criminal isn't a race of people nor are undocumented persons. They just happen to be mostly mexican. Please point out some more bigotry.
"Please do not put Black Lives Matter in the same category as Antifa.  Very rarely has BLM engaged in or preached violence.  It is part of ""implicit bias"" that people see violence tendencies in black people where there is none.  Antifa, unfortunately, has good intentions but actively preaches violence.   It is generally not fatal violence, not homicidal, but rather a violence of fists and clubs (which of course themselves can accidentally result in violence.)  I support the goals of both groups but condone violence only in a case of necessary self-defense."
"Right, because he was black man who became president"
"So Charles, why don't you believe all black lives matter?"
I find the most hatred directed at people of colour comes from WASPs. And I'm not familiar with Greece or Spain. Aren't we discussing North America? Besides the WASPs I know would describe Spaniards as black people. So I'm not sure how that improves your argument.
"Sad that these players think that kneeling to protest racism cures black ills.  Racism doesn't explain black-on-black crime, rape, or murder.  More importantly, complaining about it doesn't give people jobs or get them an education.  I just read that Colin Kaepernick has donated $1 million dollars to charity.  This gesture is much appreciated and will make a real difference in people's lives."
"Let's not pretend liberals aren't nervous about people who are different. Just try to find a prominent lefty who embraces, say, a judicially conservative black Supreme Court justice. Or a diversity of economic thought, including supply-side views, in a university Economics department."
"Yet the belief endures, from an earlier age until today, that visible, affluent African-American entertainers are obliged to adopt a pose of ceaseless gratitude, appreciation for the waiver that spared them the low status of so many others of their kind.

 Stevie Wonder began a performance in Central Park Saturday night by taking a knee, prompting Congressman Joe Walsh to tweet that Wonder was “another ungrateful black multi-millionaire.” 

Ungrateful is the new uppity. 

Trump’s supporters, by a twenty-four-point margin, agree with the idea that most Americans have not got as much as they deserve, though they overwhelmingly withhold the right to that sentiment from African-Americans. 

Thus, the wonder is not the unhinged behavior of this weekend but rather that it took Trump so long to exploit a target as rich in potential racial resentment as wealthy black athletes who have the temerity to believe in the First Amendment."
"Now the absence of ""one drop"" nonsense is defined as ""oppression."" Most of the people I've encountered who insist that ""black"" is a ""social construct"" and has nothing to do with phenotype are just trying to save and legitimize the ""one drop"" myth."
"I wonder if he saw himself as 'a good Black' or as 'a bad Black'?

I see his mother and the psychiatrist/psychologists who were involved as complicit in these deaths even though 'innocent' in the legal sense."
"What exactly do these Republicans who think this ""didn't go far enough"" exactly want to do to us? Has the Republican party gone stark raving mad? (answer: most of them, yes). The ACA is what used to be the Republican idea for health care. But since a black president implemented it, it needs to be destroyed. And then just to punish American for voting for a black president, they want to make things worse than they were before the ACA.

Meanwhile, the pharma bros, insurance companies, lawyers and specialists all rake in the billions at our literal expense. No politician will take a poke at these real problems, since these billionaires who profit obscenely off our helathcare bought them off and own them."
"BLM rose up under Obama. Tell me how Obama had a great relationship with black Amartica.
BLM came from cities with black Democrat leaders. Tell me how the policies of those black Democrats helped their constituents. 

The only reason Trump may have to fix his relationship with black America is because Obama has hands him a poisoned chalice."
"Who's the Boogyman in the woodpile now?  I'll give you a hint, he's not black."
Was there ever a secession that was deemed legal by the central government? Remember that blacks used to be legally denied the franchise.
"Black folks say it all the time. So it's racist that a person of one race can't say a word while a person of another race can't. Either it's ok for everyone, or it's not."
"Wow. Why is transformation of our economy,  sports , businesses etc also a zero sum game with certain sections of our population?  Please tell me which of the sports people named in this article are preferential picks? Please stop equating black with inferior or incompetent."
"The overwhelming majority of the black Monday protestors were not racist. It is the likes of you that try and portray them that way. 

You are joining The New Age in crass labelling. Do some introspection.

In the last two days in my community there were 4 black farm workers killed in an attack, and one of our previous residents killed on his farm in the Free State. Last month a friend was killed in a farm attack near Loskop dam.

Get a life."
"Why is that prominent BLM whacko, Yusra Khogali allowed to attend UofT when there is clear evidence she was on university property hurling racial slurs at a black man who was speaking at a rally held on university property?"
"BLF seems to like strong curry. Just wondering, do you get something like a black Indian?"
"Viva La Hillary. Ebba, ebba undalay.  Women, blacks, Hispanics, Mexicans, Latinos, and a whole lot of Republicans and billionaires for Hillary.  Woot, woot."
"Okay, I didn't read the entire essay.  I stopped about half way through when it became clear to me that her father raised her as a ""black person"" rather than as a ""person"", and imbued in her a racial tension that prevents her from ""fitting in"".

Over the years, I have worked with people of many ethnic origins, all having the quality that they didn't see themselves as of any particular ethnicity.  From the inside looking out, I can't see myself, just as they couldn't see themselves.  It was this attitude that made us compatible co-workers.  In fact, this essay had me to consciously recall my former co-workers, to recall what they even looked like to see if they fit the label of ""ethnically diverse"".

I suggest that this author try to wind back the clock to the 4-year age and start over.  The way we act influences the way people react."
"You make a broad statement with your last statement.   You are also right that Germany  has no statues.  They want to try and divorce themselves of that history, which they never will be able to do.  Also, whether Black Americans want to admit or not, these statues are part of their culture and history also."
What is illiberal.  were Black slaves in your fictional militia bearing arms?  The individual right is a myth.
"""Many blacks believe that Jews participated in civil rights out of their own immediate and self-defined needs and that their activism had little to do with Jewishness. That activism of the past, they say, tended to be both condescending and controlling. Never a relationship of equals, they assert, Jews sat on the boards of black organizations and held power in black institutions but never allowed for the reverse. They gave money to civil rights organizations and demanded the right to make decisions by virtue of the power of their purses. Moreover, they alledge, Jews today try to cash in on that assistance. They have ex post facto attached a price tag to the historic alliance and expect blacks, out of gratitude for services rendered, to censure voices within the black community.""

"Which was a 33% increase over the percentage who vote for Romney.

Worse for the loser, the percentage of eligible black voters who came out to vote for her dropped."
"Um, your argument is a PC left wing progressive Den leader kicked a progressive left wing kid out of the Den for questioning a Republican State Senator for her un-PC remarks about black people? Is that right?"
"Interesting Fact: Regardless of the race of the policemen, it's been found that because of the over-arching stereotypes and narratives, policemen of any race are more likely to discriminate against minorities and especially black people. This includes black officers and is tied to implicit bias. It's very complicated. Most incidents of racism are caused by implicit biases, not explicit ones, meaning that even though an individual on a concious level thinks racism and discrimination is wrong, at an implicit level they still react a certain way. No one escapes implicit bias.It is therefore critical that we are aware of them."
As opposed to the 1/3 black president?
"You lost me at the 'racial-pandering' bit, AC, but then you seldom make sense when it comes to 'race' anyway.  But by all means, tell us what you meant by that.  Were the black Union troops somehow incompetent or 'inferior' according to you?  Should they have been relegated to cooks and stewards for the officers, as they would be in the US military only a decade or so later?

Sorry, that wasn't what contemporary observers had to say about the matter.  Were it not for the 'colored' troops, it's likely the Confederacy would have won the war (instead of subsequently achieving a 'victory' of sorts via infiltration and political treachery that continues to this day).

I believe it was in a letter to Karl Marx that Frederick Engels observed the Union was doomed to defeat without black troops, and if they refused to conscript them ""...they'll get a hiding, and they'll deserve it."""
"""Check your privilege!"" and ""Black lives matter!""are examples of sloganeering, not name-calling."
"Finally, really no surprise, an ultimate insider sells the Clintons down the river, as they enter their twilight years with no ""rain-maker"" impact on the Democratic Party anymore.  Hillary and Bill won't survive this one . . . it's not Monica and Belleview . . . it's a decrepit candidate and her doddering husband at the end of a sordid career in ""politics.,"" unmasked by a black, female power broker lionized by the Party consigliari."

"Arabs began the African slave trade  thousands of years ago.  Europeans practiced African slavery for only about 200 years and stopped because they realized the immoral corruption of it.   No  European nation continues slavery of any sort, while Arab / Muslim nations continue the same slave trade they began long ago.  Nothing has changed for Muslims of the ME where ownership of sex slaves and forced human bondage are still norms as signs of wealth."
"Absolutely.  I'm just thinking about the availability of those other resources. If your first resource is contraception, and there isn't much in the way of secondary resources, or much sense that society has any dignified use for you or any children you may choose to have, it's not a huge leap to think there's a whiff of eugenics around that first resource. I think well intentioned people can easily miss that, and fail to appreciate how that can contribute to the understanding that little value is placed on the lives of poor people of color. 

Birth control is fundamental to women's equality, but it will not achieve the equality of poor women of color.  It just won't. It opens up worlds of possibility to women who do not belong to the underclasses, but those worlds remain largely closed to the rest, however many children they do or don't have."

"Convenient you left out the word ""roiting"".
 Also, just because it is protected does not mean it is right, and does not mean that people in power can not point out the flaws and let people know they do not support the flawed parts of the idea. The point is Obummer has shown to align himself with the BLM movement, which has proven that it believes ONLY black lives matter."
The trip is slated for next week as he has a busy schedule of tweeting lined up for the next few days - lots of black athletes to bash.
"Willfully ignorant comment.100s of ODs have occurred at Insite over yrs, but not 1 OD has been fatal 'cause medical personnel R on hand to revive people. If those same ODs had happened in alleys or rooms, do you think they'd have all been non-fatal? No, eh? These sites SAVE MANY LIVES.  The fentanyl crisis is worsening but that that doesn't mean safe injections sites are useless, as you falsely claim. On the contrary, bad as it is now, the situation would be MUCH WORSE with many MORE deaths if there were no such life-saving sites. Get it now? Good. 
Btw, the fentanyl crisis is not a drug problem, it's primarily a PROHIBITION PROBLEM,a direct outcome  of foolish prohibition laws than prevent users from accessing legal,standardized doses of drugs of known purity.Opioids wd B much safer if legal and carefully regulated as we do with deadly tobacco and alcohol. People are dying in droves 'cause our laws force them to play black-mkt-drugs roulette. End the failed, hypocritical war on drugs."
"A choice!!   Absurd!!    What woman wants to cover herself in black cloth in 30C weather including her head and face?   Think of the inconvenience, the impracticality of it.

Excellent article.  At the heart of the matter are arrogant people who seem to think that people of color are incapable of using our own voices.  Makes me (an older woman of color) laugh just thinking about it.  I suggest that we speak for ourselves and let others speak for themselves.  Should fix the problem.
"The Rockies are the worst team ever! Holland will never save another game! Bud Black can't manage his pocket lint! The Monforts are stealing your hard earned money! Nobody can hit! Nobody can pitch!

But it's closer to September than July and we're still talking about them which is a vast improvement from past years. Honest objective discussion is great. However, the joyous abandon with which some people spew forth their negative proclamations, is perplexing to me.."
"Mr. Trudeau said that while Canada is always welcoming to vulnerable people, the government needs to make sure it’s doing so the “right way.”
.....................................................................................................................................................................................................................................
It is high time that Justin Trudeau get out of his egotistic competition with Pope Francis for Best Humanitarian, and, for the sake of Canadian civilisation, act on the wisdom that the ""right way"" in response to all these refugees is to address the domestic factors that have caused the refugee flows.  In the case of Syria there is vicious Islamic sectarianism, which prevents the stubborn Syrians from reconciliation and openness to diversity in their homeland in the example of South Africans after apartheid and Rwandans after the 1990s genocide.  In the case of Africans,  government corruption is the evil dynamic."
"This is the guy who carried a quote on a piece of paper in his wallet from Reverend Samuel D. Proctor ...When asked to explain the passage, Holder replied, “It really says that … I am not the tall U.S. attorney, I am not the thin United States attorney. I am the black United States attorney. And he was saying that no matter how successful you are,  there’s a common cause that bonds the black United States attorney with the black criminal or the black doctor with the black homeless person.”

What about the rest of us Americans, Mr. Holder?  Those of us who don't see ourselves by the color of our skin - I don't feel as though you served us with the same leniency you served Shabazz and other members of your same race....what I see is a censured, anti-American..."
"There is a reason the Olympics, the NCAA, and sports organizations around the country disagree with you. Have you ever stopped to consider why? It's because your assumptions about puberty are wrong. 

If you want to start campaigning for bone density classes in sports then I will certainly believe what you're saying isn't about prejudice. But you're going to have a hard time justifying having all the black women out there (who average in the male range) in their own class. It's going to look like prejudice to them too. And you haven't even come close to proving that bone density gives all the advantages you are assuming. Hence why arguments about bone density are so spurious. 

If you had studies showing there was a difference in physical performance for trans women, superior to that of cisgender women, then you would have something real. Until then, all you have is an argument tat isn't even half baked. 

These orgs didn't accept trans people on a whim. They had reasons you ignore"
"Dear Jim, with all due respect, I disagree: Americhristianity never has ""its best day"" being ""nothing more than Churchianity"".  That's exactly what it wants you to think, and then dismiss it as ""mere Churchianity"" . No, Americhriatianity is a dangerous, anti-Christian, Gospel-betraying, dangerous cult masking itself as ""church"" (like Satan appearing in the guise of Light, Lucifer).  Americhristianity's Trinity is: the leader (German: Der Führer), the gun (law-and-order-or-else!), and the flag (draping the cross into invisibility - ""the Other"" shall die on it; it burns in black neighborhoods; it is not the Cross of Jesus Christ, nor is the flag the symbol of the US Flag and the values the Flag represents, but its vile usurpation).  I am serious.  A Dutch Jesuit, deceased several years now, who taught systematic theology in Chicago through many years, once stated that, should the RCC ever experience a schism again, it would take place in the USA.  His comment may turn out to be true..."
"I am not suggesting that murder of anyone by anyone ought to be discounted.  BLM was formed in reaction to the disproportionate rates at which police officers shoot black men.  That is the issue that they are addressing.
I believe that the murder rate would be lowered if we spent more money on education to improve inner city schools, if we did a better job enforcing gun laws, if we offered more support for families in need, if  we had better after school programs, if we did a better job preventing teen pregnancies ....
It's not at all fair to suggest that BLM people don't care about black murder victims.  No one organization can address all of society's evils and shortcomings."
"Subsidized Public Broadcasting Is our only protection against Money worshipping Brainwashing !!!!   George Will is a simple minded ideological fanatic.  
Public Broadcasting teaches children to think out of the box.  It finds innovative cutting edge ways to teach math, reading and science to all of our children in proven ways that rival the best schools, and do not include dogmatic right wing religiousness, or archaic disproven religious narratives.  Public Broadcasting is largely the intellectual power that keeps our great nation from devolving into an animalistic and hedonist cesspool.  I would venture to say it's more important than Christianity, to the past and future development of a decent American civilization.

George Will's opinion is that of a barbarian repeating and emulating catch phrases from a large body of intellectually flawed ideological works to fabricate something convenient, to ""sound"" like it's meaningful.  

His commentary Is up there with Charlie Browns teacher"
"This article seems selective and overly PC.  First, it isn't just the US that is experiencing an increase in ethnic angst, it's happening all across Europe and Asia as well.  Are people there following Trump too?  And of course Hawaii has its own similar problem with nativism, as the SPLC has bravely pointed out.  (When is Kill Haole Day this year, anyway?)  Second, while synagogues have suffered from vandalism and bomb threats, at least four US mosques were outright destroyed by arson.  US Senators lined up to condemn the bomb threats but were silent about violent attacks against members of other groups.  Why is anti-semitism treated as especially bad?  Why did the authors mention the black American who made 8 bomb threats, but not the Israeli man who made dozens?  Why is criticism of the policies of Israel (or acknowledgement of their nuclear weapons) so politically incendiary?   I wonder how much of that hypocrisy and favoritism ironically leads to the vandalism and swastikas."
"I agree that we should be putting as much money as possible into the hands of African groups as possible, but why not take it a step further? Instead of setting up a system where we are basically ideologically driven abortion dealers, we should be helping Africa help itself (so that, in the future, women need less abortions and we don't need to send money at all).

We've been micromanaging the native reservations for years. The government spends a lot of money, the natives are still getting screwed and it hasn't worked out that well for either party. Why would foreign aid be any different?

Western influence should be limited to providing/overseeing/auditing the money. Let the Africans choose how to spend it. My guess? Most would prefer improving sex education to providing abortions.

If we are going to just send them band aid solutions - send food and medicine."
"So sad that people had to go through this. I remember once in Juneau, back in the late 50s, my parents were attending a conference of BIA teachers. They went to lunch or dinner at a Juneau restaurant. It so happened that one of the teachers/educators was black. The proprietor of the place came over and informed them they did not serve blacks. So ALL of them got up and left. My Dad would tell that story and I'd just want to cheer!"
"Now comes the consequence of ""Black Lives Matter"" and the ""Liberal Left"" agenda in the United States.  Ying/Yang?

"NO ""equality"" is NOT a worthy cause, and it WAS dreamed up by a  left wing agenda.  ""Equal Opportunity"" on the other hand is a worthy cause.

The left no longer fights for equal opportunity but equal outcome and equality just for the sake of ""equality"" This is a different animal.

I'm not sure Kappernick knows what he is protesting. He talks about black oppression as a million dollar paid black paid to sit, but quotes police shootings which have nothing to do with oppression."
"Oh I see so shutting down political speech that you disagree with is OK because you've determined they're ""racists""...got it. It's ironic you're against grouping people together and making judgements based on anecdotal things yet you can't see the hypocrisy in lumping together and calling all Trump supporters racists? Does that mean that this weirdo stabber respresents all Sanders and Stein supporters? What about the black clad thugs in Antifa? They're Sanders people too...? Of course not. The Portland Mayor is using this event as a pretext to shut down speech he disagrees with just like all you little flaggers who know when you've lost."
"So there is no duty to protect and intervene in cases of genocide if it happens in an Asian country? What about African countries? Latin American, are those ok because they are majority Christian? Or is it just in European countries?"

Sorry Europe but your countries are too far gone for saving in respects to a migrant crisis. I only hope we give our heads a shake here."
"Well William, I agree that Carson's heart is in the right place. But I see no evidence that he has the personal experience or other qualifications to clean the ""swamp"" in a constructive way. Surgeons are good at ordering people around. Im sure there are exceptions who make good leaders. But I'd want strong evidence of that before selecting one to wield a scalpel in a large government bureaucracy. 

Trump is a businessman. I don't believe he would ever hire Carson to even run one of his hotels. But it's fine to put him in charge of a multi-billion dollar federal agency? I agree with Cloudjockey's comment above. Carson is a candidate for the position because he is Black and because he supported Trump. I don't like it when Democrats use tax funded agencies and positions to reward friends and supporters, regardless of qualifications. And we need to call out Republicans when they do it."
"You hit the nail on the head.  You can't on the one hand support police shooting Tamir Rice or any of the 100 other UNARMED black citizens shot by police in 2015, yet say that Finicum's death was an outrage.  Unless you are a...Trump supporter (new code for racist)."
"Nine years into our ""recovery"" the only group who have not benefitted from the ""growth"" are working people. Their wages continue to be depressed. Corporations have piles of money and the rich continue to get pull away economically. These conditions have been brewing for over thirty years. A large cohort of profoundly anxious people, who are not necessarily the economy's losers, chose to express their poorly understood and articulated angst by electing an incompetent to the presidency, just to create confusion. They blame the same people who did what their parents or grandparents did, that is immigrate to this country. They become ever more tribal as they look for new people to blame - in addition to - liberals, African Americans, Mexicans, immigrants, agnostics, LGBTs, while not comprehending the real causes for their condition. They flail impotently as they elect people who have literally no interest in making their lives better."
"Good for ADN.  Perhaps they'll make people like you, Black, Obooba, Craig, and Chance disappear for good."
"Defenders of cops always like to point out that more African Americans kill police officers than police officers that kill African Americans. The difference though, is that the 'cop killers' are convicted of murder and face justice while police officers overwhelmingly go free for murdering African Americans."

You might not want to keep your mind open enough to pay attention,I keep hearing tough environmental regulations have contributed significantly to the huge recent  drop in prices of alternative  nonpolluting  energies;  far more efficient automobile engines, and far cleaner urban air situations in places like California, Arizona- 
 And you might not want to believe the validated truths that technology  and the need for better educated & trained workers is the prime horse driving US job loss –  or that not too many US citizens want jobs picking tobacco,fruit and vegetables,or as maids or babysitters - but that data could be ""fake news"",right?

"Bear - I was following along a series of questions asked by another commenter that were focused on late term abortion and seemed more concerned with what we are doing here in the U.S. than what is happening in El Salvador.  Conversations wander.  I don't think my comment is any more out-of-line than many other comments in this thread.  

What is happening in El Salvador regarding abortion is horrible.  There are no exceptional circumstances recognized under law which would allow an abortion - no abortion in case of rape or incest, to protect the life/health of the mother, no abortion if there are fetal defects.  This is the Catholic bishops dream - women as cows.  This is the kind of law that only works when the world is perfect, when there is no rape, when a pregnancy never threatens the life or health of a woman.    

We have to remain vigilent here so we do not turn back the clock the way El Salvador did in the late 1990's and is threatening to happen in Poland.

Satisfied?"

"baloney. What injustice? Black on black murders, especially in Chicago? Abortions of black babies? Those are honest-to-goodness injustices and both are controlled by blacks. These millionare football players no nothing of injustice!"
"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest. I'll save my sympathy on those who deserve it."
"one word: Xenophobia, and the entire article is trash at ground level - basic black racism is what negates the articles title entirely"
"""And police have continued to shoot and kill a disproportionately large number of black males, who account for nearly a quarter of the deaths, yet are only 6 percent of the nation’s population.""

I always find it interesting when media outlets compare the number of black males shot against their percentage of representation in the general population as opposed to comparing it to the percentage of blacks who are criminals.  Hmmm..I wonder if that's because there wouldn't be any gap at all, if they did.  Nawwww...there's no way today's media outlets would cherry pick the stats at hand to make a point....nawwwww...."
"Something hilariously hypocritical is going on, which basically unmasks the fact that this is not about patriotism, but about racism - through the conflation of partriotism and opposition to protests over racial injustice.

So, players have kneeled, players have remained in the lockeroom.  Owners have shown up on the field to lock arms with their players.

And while this is going on, WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS PERFORMED, the yahoos in the stands are yelling at the players to stand up.  WHILE THE NATIONAL ANTHEM IS BEING PERFORMED.

- Not standing deferentially.

- Not standing and paying attention to the glory of the flag and anthem.

-Yelling orders at black men below them.

. . . maybe they think that conduct IS what patriotism is all about??"
"This racism perpetuated by The Gupta family, is similar to the one perpetuated by the Indian community in KZN, particularly Durban. The manner in which they treat black people, their disgust for black people, you would swear they too aren't black. I hope that this racist behaviour by the Guptas and you  calling them out Ranjeni Munusamy, hits home to the Indian community in South Africa as a whole. A beautiful article nonetheless. It's about time we get these bastards pay back their ill gotten money they are stealing with JZ and deport them back to India. As for the other people involved in state capture, they should get ready to trade their expensive tailor made suits and dresses for the notorious orange jumpsuit."
"I'm Asian, and about 70% of the racial slurs thrown at me have been from black folks. They ranged from ""Open your eyes!"" to ""Do you speak English?""

"None of it matters.  Like I said from the beginning, Hillery Dillery will get in no matter what due to the mass corruption going on in this poor excuse of a country.   We are in an age where people of color can vote 5 or more times, brag about it on national television, and get away with it.  The dead arise again just to vote.  Identification can not be asked for.  Illegals get to vote.  Racist black groups are allowed to intimidate and even threaten voters at polling locations.  

America, the quickest to rise........the quickest to fall......."
Its also telling that even though I didn't mention blacks once in my comment you immediately assumed I was talking about the black community in relation to police violence.
"I've met Linda Hamilton on more than one occasion and I can tell you from my own experience that she is a flat out racist and plays the part of a victim at damn near any and every chance she gets. She'll go out of her way to make sure it's pointed out that she's black and she scts like that gives her specal rights and privileges. The irony is that if anyone else points that same thing out to her in the exact same way she does, they're racist and trying to bring her down. If you want to be treated as equal, you must first see yourself as equal...a concept she still hasn't learned. It's too bad too, because she can actually be a pretty nice person if she wanted. Unfortunately she seems to only want to be a victim...and will probably try and sue the Register-Guard for allowing me to post this..."
"Black supremacy is OK though, eh?"
It all started because blacks want the 'right' to not be arrested following their robbing a 7-11. Need to keep this basic point in mind...

"Agreed, the black clad black shirted Fascists are far more intelligent, wearing hoodies and masks to cover their faces as they run riot , burn, damage public and private property, throw rocks etc., at policemen.

The brown shirts are National socialists ( Nazis) a different breed of totalitarian Marxists....the Reds, of course , are their socialist totalitarian cousins, the Communists.

Black= Fascists .
Brown = National Socialists.
Red= Communists.

Another shooting in Baltimore. 8 people wounded by 3 gunmen. Police say it was a retaliatory attack from a Labor Day shooting. Add 11 more black on black shooting's. Where is black lives matter? Oh yeah there is no media value without a cop involved.
So the Repuglican majority in Congress is Obama's fault? That takes the cake. Apparently. everything is Obama's fault. Repugs are just helpless victims of the black president.
Milo only dates black guys.
I'm sure the millions of people suffering in the Middle East don't care that Obama is classy. I'm sure the families of policemen shot by inflamed blacks in the US don't care that Obama is classy.  Wow.
"The Mighty Racist speaks again. Can you make one comment with out bringing race into it? Why is it fitting he is a Black man? What does that have to do with anything. I am sorry your are not happy with the race or all the races you were born with but please do not pass on the hatred to your family. Or go ahead and raise them as racists if you choose, the decision is yours."
"OKC was 20+ years ago. Most mas killings in the US the last few years were done by Muslims (except in Chicago were it is African American gang members killing each other and civilians at an appalling rate). Pray tell what ""Christian"" attacks/massacres have occurred in America? Christians do murder each other all the time here, ""Bob the Catholic killing his brother when they were drunk"" doesn't count. When have Christians in the US targeted another religious/ethnic group simply because they didn't like that group? Have fun hugging the notoriously homophobic Muslims, you'll probably get your butt kicked. You don't seem like a very tough individual."

"Thats not what I suggested at all and im not really sure where any of what you said came from.  Again, the issue is that Trumps stance encapsulates ALL trans people.  If someone is just post-op and is still going through a lot of medical issues - I can totally understand why they should not be accepted at that time...just as I would expect an otherwise healthy individual who just broke their leg to not be accepted until they are back to being 100% again.   

But to deny a trans person who has been post-op for years and is no longer needing medical procedures done or anything like that - thats just wrong.  If they are physically capable of meeting the minimum standards for joining the military, then they should be allowed to join.  Trumps policy statement suggests that he does not care what the health is of the trans person is in any way; just that the simple fact they are trans, is a disqualifier.  Kind of like how being black, or a woman, or gay used to be."
"Whether or not these sour grapes Democrats decide to attend  the inaugaration or not is really insignificant. Maybe they could march with all the man hating feminists as well.   I expect that Congresspersons John Lewis and Maxine Waters will  keep up their race hustling along with the rest of the Black Caucus keeping Black people fearful, angry, resentful, and hating Whitey to keep them on the Democrat voting block to put these parasites in office to live high on the hog off the government.  On January 20th, 2017 Donald Trump will be the 45th President of the United States.  Their beloved President Obama isn't going away though. He will resume his community organizing domestically as a race hustler keeping Black people on the Democrat voting block as a dependency class.  And he will go on the speaking circuit internationally getting very rich badmouthing his own country and advocating one world government under the United Nations in order to save the planet from GLO-BULL warming"
"And the first flag the KKK used to hang poor innocent blacks was the Stars and Stripes. The flag used to commit murder, steal land, break treaties and commit genocide against Native American men, women and children was the Stars and Stripes. The yankee officers that after the war committed these horrendous acts were Sherman, Sheridan (the only good Indian is a dead Indian), Custer, Crook and others. The president of the United States that gave his blessings and orders for these atrocities was guess who......Ulysses Simpson Grant, the drunkard!"
"I find this rather ironic, especially since there are members of the gay community who find  rappers, predominantly black, to be quite angry, homophobic and disrespectful to the gay community... not to mention the Caribbean and African nations (again, predominantly black) that openly promote violence and even killing of gay men.

I'm still waiting for BLM to issue a response on  this topic (which they curiously seem to gloss over).  The irony of the situation is disgusting!"
"Are you kidding me ?   Just when you think you've heard it all .  These mushers are one goofy lot .  The musher with the doped dogs say's he didn't do it but adds there's a half percent chance he did---by accident .  And the gang of mushers demands the musher be named---giving the Iditarod 72 hours to name him or else---thinking it will clear all of them from being under a cloud . The only problem is that the musher who claimed he , by 99.5 percent didn't do it--- suggests one of the other teams did it on purpose .   The Iditarod is getting the black eye it clearly deserves .  From winning mushers smoking dope on the trail to doped dogs the Iditarod needs to be ended.  Short races like the Rondy don't hurt dogs .  Forcing dogs to run days on end just so the owners can win prize money is animal abuse .   It's basic logic---IF this musher didn't dope his own dogs--why would he say he's not running in next years race ?  If it walks like a duck it's usually a duck . Where's PETA ?"

"These lazy crybaby-boyz are pathetic!  Instead of kneeling why don't they stand up like men and work to CHANGE whatever they're 'protesting'.  

Hey big guys, put your money where your knees are, and for instance, set up school scholarships for disadvantaged youth, or go out to work with the misguided kids hangin' on the street corner, just wasting away their lives.

There's a thousand ways these big babies of the gridiron could 'make a difference' in the REAL lives of blacks----BUT that would mean manning-up and giving up some of their 'club time'. . . the paaaaaaaty scene livin' the high life of  a big shot.

Instead, the boyz prefer to 'take the knee' every week while the rest of the country stands to honor and revere country, flag and sacrifice.  

These louts are exactly where the left wants 'em----on their knees, genuflecting to the liberal doctrine of  their stinkin' politics.

Keep it up, and a lot more of 'em will end up like Kappernick, unemployed & hangin' on the corner."
We do know that the number of African American males that kill police officers and other citizen more often than any other group.
"""But we are probably more tolerant than any Western nation""

That's ridiculous. You have twice the rate of hate crimes as the U.S. does. You are probably the only Western nation to be found to be denying the human rights of your own citizens. None of your minorities reach critical mass as far as pct of the population is concerned and as the writer of the article states, the majority in Canada is in firm control.  You're locking up your largest minority as a percentage of the population at a rate in excess of blacks in the U.S.
Your immigration policy would be unacceptable in probably every other Western country as it would be considered 'discriminatory'. Your 40000 recent immigrants were limited to families, homosexuals and orphans but they are bandied about as if your tolerance and inclusion is due to your genetics."
"right wing racial hatred has always divided this nation, it got worse during the '50s / '60s cos of the civil rights movements which improved relations somewhat among the educated but further inflamed the haters and it really pissed them off that they could no longer widely impose their toxic will or lynch with impunity. cue newt gingrich and his non-stop pounding of the wedge...
then ol' black Obama comes along after the disastrous dubya / cheny years and legitimately beats the crap out of the never right... TWICE! while heading a historic economic recovery and the hate mob's throbbing head veins couldn't take the pressure any more.
he irreparably divided this country merely by being black and then kicking righty butts for 8 years, they simply couldn't handle it and typically errant righty rants repeatedly prove it.

"The glaring and often repeated problem is that -- yes --- the only time you see marches in the street about Black lives mattering is when a police officer kills a black man.  The horrifying rate of black-on-black murder is ho-hum, even in the communities most affected by it."
"Unmm Hillary accepted 25 million from Saudi Arabia, that's about as ANTI women and ANTI LGBTQ as you can get.  In addition she eulogized Robert Byrd, high ranking KKK member.  The only thing she has done for the black community is push mass abortions, even for full term babies.

"Bottomline, as an organisation, the ANC is clueless. As a leader, Jacob Gupta is the mafioso Don, using patronage and money (violence could be added) to keep himself in the driving seat. 

Wealth is surely not created by taking it away from the ""haves"" and give it to the ""have nots""? Let's have a frank and honest assessment of what happened to the land which actually has been transferred to previously disadvantaged people. We pay our taxes so that it can be used to uplift society and the poorest, but all I see is how it is stolen and ends up in Dubai and Saharanpur.

And while we're at it, let's have a discussion about how before European colonisation there was african-on-african colonisation. Do people really think that Ubuntu was at the heart of the expansion of the Zulu kingdoms? Zulus migrated down from the Great Basins region of East Africa - do we really think they did this without murder, rape, torture, displacement, atrocity?"
"I love the republican right wingers threatening churches with the loss of non-profit status and with heightened ICE enforcement tactics when they run afoul of their perception of what churches can legally do.  But what happened when churches wanted to carve out birth control provisions in Obamacare (a law which was passed by both houses and signed by the executive)?  Well back then these same churches were poor and oppressed, maligned and misused by the first black president.  It’s really the height of hypocracy."
"My party doesn’t exist anymore,” she said.

That about sums it up.

The Progressive Conservatives have been taken over by the Reformers, a party associated with far right lunatics, racists, anti Semites,  anti gay marriage, anti Muslim, anti Climate Change, anti science, anti education/educated, anti pension reform, anti increased wages for Canadians, anti anything and everything this country/Canada stands for

"Joe Walsh is an insane maniac.   However, to be fair, I don't think that he represents the average Republican.  

He only served one two year term in the Congress.   Once people realized how crazy he was, they would not re-elect him.  He went into talk radio the next year, but was fired by his sponsor station just a year into working for them, for repeatedly using the word ""N I G G E R"" on his program.

He now has his own talk show, but it is just mainly online podcasts and YouTube videos.   It is only on the air on minor radio stations in only 4 cities in America.

He is now pretty much considered to be an abject failure, and a fringe person: a total loser.  Even his own wife divorced him, he is that bad."
"a definite possibility - if the guys in the car were loaded or especially stupid to do such things on W 11, chasing a black guy might have seemed a good idea.

I jay walked with my black step brother across a street in Inglewood many years ago, more of a mixed race neighborhood - we got stopped by a cop who actually pulled over to the curb and  upshot was my step brother got a ticket!  I got a lecture about being a ""follower"".  blew my mind  - right then I learned ...yeah....different rules for different people."
Cossman is an acknowledge sexist and hates men. Does the Globe also publish from Black Panthers or KKK?
"I feel it's important to point out that the rally in Charlottesville was not just racist. It was anti-Semitic and it was anti-LGBTQ as well. The slurs the Nazis and KKK were using moved from racial slurs to gay slurs to anti-Semitic slurs with frightening regularity. They wanted to make sure they terrorized certain groups of people and they did just that. Jewish folks, LGBTQ and people of color are now feeling trepidation when walking home alone at night in Charlottesville (and many other areas of this country). 
I only mention this because Trump has already broken his word on ""supporting LGBTQ people"" and it makes me wonder if that's who he'll hit next in order to rally his base AGAIN. Since the Nazi's were very vocal in their gay hate rhetoric in Charlottesville, I think it's a subject that should be discussed openly and honestly before something bad happens and Catholics wish they had spoken against the homophobic rhetoric being spewed by the Nazis.   
My two cents worth."
"More conservative drivel. What twittler did Friday night absolutely led to the mass protests this weekend. Every player had every right to protest, and protest strongly, against our racist, ineloquent, foul-mouthed, hate-inducing POTUS and his wayward divisive agenda. I stand with the players 100% on this. Inequality and violence against African Americans in this country is real."
"Trump is a master deal maker, negotiater and strategist. He built a great company and employs thousands of people, some whom are tremedous people, even hispanics, whom he loves but also the blacks, he employs several of them too.  He knows how to make a deal, a great deal not a bad deal, some of the worst deals ever made, were made by Obama and Trump only makes the best deals, believe me.  Trump also knows how to build things, like a great wall so tall, Mexicans can only get over it with a long rope.  He is an expert at ecommunication so when he feels the need to tell the truth to the people he sends a series of tweets that will unify and inform his base  but also put his enemies on their heels as he effortlessly manuevers the field of 140 characters.  He will also deal with a Nuclear Threat by tweet, since it will ultimately intimidate his adversaries. Thanks Murica, and as far as Trump being the greatest president of all time like his base claims, I guess, we'll see."
"From Common Dreams:

Black’s assessment of Salazar, Podesta and the transition team’s four co-chairs is withering. “These aren't just DNC regulars, Democratic National Committee regulars,” he said in an interview with The Real News Network. “What you're seeing is complete domination by what used to be the Democratic Leadership Council.

So this was a group we talked about in the past. Very, very, very right-wing on foreign policy, what they called a muscular foreign policy, which was a euphemism for invading places. And very, very tough on crime—this was that era of mass incarceration that Bill Clinton pushed, and it's when Hillary was talking about black ‘superpredators,’ this myth, this so dangerous myth.”

Black added: “And on the economic side, they were all in favor of austerity. All in favor of privatization. Tried to do a deal with Newt Gingrich to privatize Social Security. And of course, were all in favor of things like NAFTA.”

"Would help if they had a recording?, just like donald would say.  But, I guess having that many 1st hand witnesses of the phone conversation don't count because they were, what??, all black?"
I don't see any mention of Black Lives Matter.  Or are they too busy plotting to disrupt Pride celebrations again in Toronto this Summer to worry about trivial matters like this?
"The same stereotyping you have of villagers could also be applied to rednecks living in trailer parks, blacks from the inner city, et al. Trying to put broad labels on a group of people is rarely accurate and never helpful."
"Today?

They were ""racist images that included nooses drawn around the necks of a black student and coach.""  Try posting them at work, along with your comment that you like them, and see how quickly you're out the door.  People are responsible for what they say and do, whether it's by actions, pictures or words.  It's not new, and it's not surprising."
"Interesting how you ""perceive"" my comments. I did not say BLM had control over all Blacks. I said that a group of protestors shouting that we want dead cops now would be an example of inciting violence. BLM and many in the media do not glorify those that shout those things, then in the next breath, justify the emotion that creates the phrase. Since many on the left, you and BLM, are not happy that that an officer is facing a murder charge in a shooting incident in Georgia, then it seems that you would prefer that the officer not have any benefit from our system of justice. No long wait for the prosecution and defense to prepare for trial, No need to wait for a jury to decide guilt or innocence, he is guilty. Just convict the officer right now and pass sentence on him. From the way that you, BLM and many on the left say, it just seems obvious you would have no problem with lynching the officer. I do not call for lynching. Your statements and those of BLM seem to support it."
"Okay. Now where's your article on the leaked DNC memo for how to ""handle"" questions from black activists?"
Can't remember if our democratic congressional delegation made similar statements about some of the violent black lives matter movements when Obama was in office.
"Hispanics voted for Trump. So did black people. And so did Muslims.

"Even if he did somehow have 'a point' about that somewhere, it is apropos of absolutely nothing. Meaning, in what even remotely conceivable historical scenario would 'blacks' have 'populated America'?

But hey, I guess he really had to get this off his chest. And what better way than to put in a newsletter?"
"So, an American black man wearing a ball cap for Chicago is yelling in the face of a Canadian man holding up a sign to stop the illegal entry to Canada.  (you know, abide the law - apply through the front door)

That man doesn't look peaceful in that photo nor acting Canadian.

Are we supposed to accept people who demand entry to Canada just because they breathe air?"
"I'm far less concerned about my safety on the light rail in PDX than I am on the streets. Ten people are slaughtered per week just in Oregon, a substantial increase over just a few years ago. 

Also, the fatal stabbing a few months ago could have been prevented if the Portland cops would have arrested the killer the day before when he assaulted a black woman (who maced him). Unfortunately, the PPB says it won't pursue a potentially dangerous suspect until back-up shows up, so they let him waltz away from his crime and return in a more lethal state of mind. (I have my suspicions that the PPB simply won't take crimes against people of color or cyclists seriously and that's why they let the violent racist go, but that's not an easy case to prove.)"
"I enjoy talking with you Bill?   LOL, couldn't resist.

 I don't think you're either, biased yes but hardly sexist or racist in the sense that you would seek to harm either women or black persons only because of their gender/ skin color.  

And since I'm being fair to you, I feel the same way about Charles.  I have no point of reference to fully feel what being a black man in American feels like.   We're lucky to have a look at one man's life from that perspective.   Not that Charles represents every black man in American, but on this site, we're lucky to have on honest opinion from even one black male and a chance to ask questions!"
"My problem is they can't define what they are protesting about. Fair, and Equal are opinions based solely on personal emotions. Tell me what actions do they want  actually want to change. If they are using a example like the Micheal Brown shooting, than they are basically asking for the police to no longer arrest black people, because they are black."
"You might have to wait a while longer:  

As an agnostic I am about 3.3% of the US population according to PEW Research Group.   The athiests about 2.4%.

According to a 2012 review by the National Council of Churches, the five largest denominations are 
The Catholic Church, 68,202,492 members
The Southern Baptist Convention, 16,136,044 members
The United Methodist Church, 7,679,850 members
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, 6,157,238 members
The Church of God in Christ, 5,499,875 members

The Southern Baptist Convention, with over 16 million adherents, is the largest of more than 200 distinctly named Protestant denominations.  In 2007, members of evangelical churches comprised 26% of the American population, while another 18% belonged to mainline Protestant churches, and 7% belonged to historically black churches."
Obama talked a good game but talk is talk. He has left the world a more dangerous place and will be considered the least effective of the black American presidents that will reach that office.
"Once again....We are not talking about people being descriminated  against for being black, women, or yes even gay. This baker didn't want to participate in a ceremony his religious beliefs say are not acceptable."
"This is what I said: ""I feel her actions were an error in judgment....not a malicious act. I felt the cries for her resignation were unjustified"" I feel disciplinary measures, whether by the criminal justice system, public employers such as the U of O or school districts, private employers, parents or any other agency with powers to ""discipline"" should be appropriate and measured.  I certainly recognize that some (perhaps many) Black students were offended by Ms Shurtz's actions.  I've never said otherwise.  I've also said, and I repeat, I don't feel her actions deserved the cries for her resignation or dismissal...perhaps a letter of reprimand in her file or whatever....but, certainly, not dismissal.  Thank you for asking,  Gary Crum"
"Obviously these ads don't have to come out and say ""Vote X"" but that seems to be the measure some are using to deny that they can influence an election or behaviour.

Am not wild about Facebook but have to use it for some things.  Couple days ago there was a shared photo of black athletes burning a flag in a locker room.  It didn't say ""Trump's Right"" or ""Taking the Knee is disrespecting the Flag"" ... because it didn't need to.

Brave new world where every Theresa, Dick or Heimirich can produce and disseminate propaganda."

You can only practice the "" freedoms I agree with""? Yeah thats what they told black people after slavery, ""hey your free"" but don't vote, or use this bathroom or try to hold offiice but hey your free"".

"Breitbart.com is not a legitimate news site and should not be held out as such by linking here, imho. They ought to rename it bubble.com. The idea that the Obama presidency has been plagued by scandal is one that many (so-called) conservatives cherish in their quest to make the first African American President a failure-it's almost as bad as all the people who would suggest the Berlin Wall would not have come down without Ronald Reagan, but not quite."
"It's easy & cowardly to rake in millions throwing a ball & taking a knee, instead of really putting forth positive action.  I don't see these same ""complainers"" & bench-side bystanders going into war zone neighborhoods to mentor in order to stop black on black murders.  How about doing a ""root cause analysis"" before blaming those that must take action (police/military) to combat the symptom's negative impact on the innocent general population.   Furthermore, any industry represented by Unions (entertainment, sports, etc). you can count on anti-American ideology, where they constantly complain about capitalism, racism & oppression, yet...have no problem taking millions, and oppressing others rights while hiding behind straw man arguments."
"I'm waiting for the actual BLM movement...you know, when the Black Lives Matter people sue the Bureau of Land Management for copyright infringement for referring to themselves as the BLM...I mean not that BLM isn't already a registered trademark or anything....but don't worry, they're a government agency, they'll cave."
"Shouldn't matter anyway. The real issue is proving that he said any such thing. Right now we are in a climate where the police & courts are being pressured to believe anything the complainant (woman) says when she has no proof to back it up. Our criminal courts have devolved into a rumour mill mediator at the expense of men's livelihoods, family ties, futures, dignity and reputations. The lying women that make these claims treat it like acting a part in the theatre and relish all the pity and showering of free supports upon them. The fact that Trudeau is endorsing this to continue with more frequency is one more black stain on him."

"History is one thing, but how do you explain what happened now? Can you explain what is the mind-set of these Nazi and KKK activists today? Many things that have happened in the past are very evil and bad, but humankind learns as it becomes more enlightened, and we don't accept these acts of human cruelty any more. Do you think the past justifies today?  If the Confederacy had actually won the Civil War, what do you think would have happened to the black slaves who couldn't escape? What if."
"But wait.  Americans mostly all believe that slavery is not so bad.  Around one percent of our entire population is locked in cages.  Just as in the days of black slavery, the many believe it is okay to deprive so many of liberty, lock them in cages, and control every aspect of their lives.  The Deady Hall issue is perpetrated by the media to distract from real issues of on-going slavery (disproportionately black) that exists right here today.  As with old style slavery, many justifications are given which the masses accept.  Even after we let these people out of cages, we label them as felons or sex-offenders and in so doing continue to control their lives as long as they live.  You think it okay?  So did the slave holders of the past.  I suggest cleaning up one's own house before carping about that of others."
"It is much more violent to encourage and incite rape and death threats and the deportation of lawful residents of the United States then it is to set a streetlamp on fire. 

Yiannopoulos uses his star appeal amongst the fascists, racists, and sexists to threaten and endanger the lives of people of color and women. He encourages his rabid fans to shut down any and all of his critics with abuse, both physical and psychological. That is an attack on free speech.

Remember that it was a supporter of Yiannopoulos that shot a man in Seattle only a handful of days ago at another talk by the man."

We could go on and on and on.........."
"Trump disparaged all POWs by disrespecting McCain's service in Vietnam. During the campaign he held a fundraiser for Vets but kept the money until the Washington Post shamed him into donating it months after the event. He assailed the character of a Gold-Star family who had the temerity to point out that Trump's proposed Muslim ban was unconstitutional and un-American. He still hasn't addressed the deaths of the four troopers killed in Niger and refused to release a generic statement of sympathy that was drafted for him in the days after the event. He promised a Gold Star father $25,000 and forgot the mail the check until it became public. He lied when he said he had called the families of every service member killed under his watch. 

He has never accepted responsibility for any of this. And you support him.

So tell us more about how the liberals are leading the, ""devolution from a rational society to and (sic) irrational me-first society."""
"Kneeling is not disrespectful. You are choosing to be offended like a triggered snowflake.

Grow up, you know nothing about me and how I conduct my self during the anthem."

"Hum, maybe not in so many words.  But there was this ""...equally true is that there is no room in America for coming to a rally one group is holding spoiling for a fight.""  Do Antifa, Black Lives Matter and whomever else was on the left side ought not have been there?  Ought not have shown up to protest the naked display racial intimidation? Again I hold not protesting it there (or here) is complicity."
"Right, Federal court protected that right. Bet Black Lives Matter,  Black Gorillas( rebranded Black Panthers),  and Chaos were there. Confrontation was a planned test by all fronts to see what the government is going to do about it. Looks like both sides  came equipped, people with attitude, flags (to rally around), uniforms, and armour (shields, helmets, sticks, improvised flame thrower) along with a new police attitude, tolerance, which is interpreted as weakness by some. Actually more interesting than pre season NFL."
"The antifa people sure do like to throw open containers of urine.

This helps reinforce their message of peace and nonviolence.

"Deny the evidence all you like and remain a party of one.

No apology is due. The political operatives revealed in Wikileaks, most of whom are Catholic themselves, said nothing outside the common discourse among Catholics.

Trump is losing big time, and you're grasping at straws."
"I think the fans Trump is trying to incite should really think about potential consequences for jumping on Trump's bandwagon, particularly Season ticketholders and stadium attendees.

The NFL owners have basically taken a position.  They're going to accommodate, without penalty, player non-vilent demonstrations during the presentation of the anthem.  Some are ging to stand right there with them to demonstrate personal approval or aquiecence.  

Seems to me that most owner/managers are prone to protecting employees, particularly against emotional customers.  The thinking is that attack on employees precedent must be deterred, and overall morale of, as well as ability to ""retain"" a workforce enhanced.

Black players constitute a clear majority of the NFL feature workforce (80%??).  Without them, the NFL product would really be inferior.  Driving them out en masse would NO DOUBT merely transfer that workforce to new owners.  

I think fan attendees who get too motivated . . ."
"How did these five individuals come into contact with one another?

"No, a president has very little to do with abolishing constitutional rights, even if she wanted to. The original Second Amendment guaranteed the right of well-regulated state militias -- essentially, all free men -- to train and be prepared to defend freedom against a potential overweening federal government. But after the Civil War -- given that southern states had used those militias instead to oppress people (blacks) and suppress freedoms (whereas the federal government had freed people) -- the Second Amendment was reinterpreted (by the Fourteenth Amendment and other Reconstruction acts) to include the right of individuals to protect themselves, so that (for instance) freed blacks could defend themselves against the rising Ku Klux Klan. And that's where we stand today. Regulations are constitutional, and the right to defend oneself is constitutional. For more on this -- and on what it would take to change it -- read the wonderful constitutional scholar Akhil Reed Amar."
"As soon as you look pass the color of President Obama's skin color, you may very well realize that President Obama looked pass the nation's skin color and tried his level best against a Just Say No Republican-led congress."
"Unfortunately Obama arrived probably ten years too soon and he was black. For the bigots that became a rallying cry. He had all the attributes to become a great president. He was articulate, very intelligent and most of all, believably compassionate. One got the feeling that he really cared. He made us all believe in ""Yes, we can"". 

Then again maybe he was the right president. If not for him, the world economy would have been in much worse shape today. Just think what would have happened if a Trump withdrew the US from the world in 2008.

Unfortunately, the Democrats lost the house early and that hobbled him. The disappointment of the unfulfilled promise and a poor candidate cost the Democrats the election and opened the way for the worst ever president of the US. He is not a conservative and neither are most of his supporters.

These people are not fighting liberalism, they are fighting the system, where corporations can take everything away from you, because China makes it cheaper."
"Welfare (as designed by congressional Democrats) has destroyed millions of Black American families. Which their own Patrick Moynihan told them it would do. Coming from a fatherless home is the number one predictor of juvenile delinquency. Hundreds of (Democrat controlled for 50 years) inner cities are plagued by crime, drugs, and the worst schools in the country. American taxpayers have spent more than 20 trillion dollars on welfare since the War on Poverty began. And if anything, our inner cities are more troubled and inner city residents are more poorly educated than previously. Welfare should be workfare for able bodied adults. Anything else is a continual insult to the recipients. Norway, while having a high per capita wealth, has an astonishingly high cost of living. Norway also utilizes its energy resources for wealth. Norway also has healthy young nicely dressed adults shamelessly sitting on sidewalks begging for money. I don't want that for my descendants."
"It's no question that misinformation, civic ignorance and apathy is abound in our society, and is a pressing issue of our time. Just as there is no denying that populism can sometimes lead to negative outcomes.  But I challenge you to find any evidence that voter suppression and disenfrachisement produces more beneficial policies and representatives for the populations that have their voices suppressed. Less voter turnout will always lead to less policy emphasis on the needs of a particular population. The founders intended the citizenry to vote with their passions, that's why they designed a system of checks and balances and representatives to make decisions on our behalf. But denying blacks the right to vote did not lead to racial equality, and denying women the vote did not lead to gender equality. Society just doesn't work that way."
"Driving legally down a one-way street with the flow of traffic and then being harassed by 'protesters' illegally coming down that same street in the wrong direction beating on your vehicle and flattening one of your tires  because you have a Trump flag is equivalent to 'poking a bear with a stick'?

In what universe?

If it had been me, I might have felt a ""reasonable belief that I was in imminent danger of serious bodily harm"" from the undisciplined obscene mob beating on my vehicle.  

You know, where I get to use ""deadly physical force"" to defend myself? 

The kind of deadly physical force which happened in Portland right after the election when the 'protesters' met the black guys (legally in their car) on the bridge and the black guys thought they were being 'dissed' and popped  a couple caps in their direction. 

Those here who encourage nastiness even here on ""Civil"" Comments should not be surprised the next time rounds go downrange."

The redkneck i mean people who hate Muslims so much I bet don't even know a Muslim.I grew up down the street fron a muslim family and played sports with the boys. They were a good family. Kids all got good grades and were active in sports. They fled the country the were from because they wanted a better life. A life where they wouldnt have to worry about their children being killed just walking down the street. Like I said so much hatred and I bet they dont know a single Muslim person.

"Exactly.   The decision to act against Zille is prompted by party-political tit for tat.  The South African electorate generally is so narrow-minded, and their mindset is rooted in victimhood.

"I recall seeing a news item on ""diversity"" where a black fellow who was a systems analyst was able to 'solve the problem'. Hooray and all that. 

The only problem was that as I listened to 'the problem', it was the sort of thing any competent systems analyst (regardless of colour, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, etc.) would have been able to solve. 

See, there are some IT problems that simply involve understanding what the problem is (often it is something like, ""We need to track the number of service calls our service reps make each week.""), knowing where the data is and then coming up with a way to get the data to where you want it to be. 

Sure, go ahead and advocate for 'diversity' (and certainly hire based on a person's ability). But recognize that 'reserving X number of seats for THIS group' because of 'unconscious bias' may mean you aren't hiring the best qualified people.  

btw, I wonder if the author runs an 'Equity Consulting' business?"
"Here again liberalism rears it's ugly head. Many of the people were under the false promise that the government would take care of them, because of Social Security, and they didn't have to do anything themselves. Liberalism has destroyed the black family, with it's false promises. In the 60's only 20% of black families were headed by a single parent. Today that number is 70%, and it's the flag and the National Anthem that's the problem. Government is and always has been the problem. The government doesn't solves problems, it creates the problem, and then magnifies the problem by fixing it. Think Health Care."

"Portugal and Spain had large Moorish populations (that were converted under duress to Catholicism). I would call them diverse - the Moors originated in North Africa. The Spanish Empire had a lot of interbreeding with the natives in Latin America. The Portuguese intermarried (and may marriage is a loose term here) with local women from Brazil to Goa. While the top positions were held by the ""purebreds"", an empire needs a large number of middle and lower middle class workers, soldiers, bureaucrats, etc. In Latin America, these obs were filled by the mixed races. The pure blooded natives were at the bottom, like the blacks in the USA.

As for China, as pointed out, their empires contained Chinese, Mongols, Koreans, Burmese, Tibetans, Naxi, Central Asians, etc. Those who don't know much about Asia might think all these countries are the same, but they are not. They speak different languages, have different religions and customs, etc."
"I wish I could be more sympathetic to the Albertans.  Unfortunately, a lot of their misfortune is of their own doing.  In the 1980s, when I lived in Alberta, there was a popular bumper sticker: ""Dear Lord. Please let there be another oil boom.  I promise I won't pi$$ it all away next time.""  Well, there was and they did.  Since the late 1940s Alberta was provided with the riches and royalties to develop the petroleum and secondary and tertiary industries and they never did.  Each time the pi$$ed it all away and now, once again, they are in financial dire straits and expecting BC to allow them to crap in their own backyard with environmental and oil spill inevitable disasters.
All one ever had to do was drive down the suburban streets of Calgary on garbage day and see the refuse from their hedonistic shopping sprees.

"Strange closing paragraph. Opium production declined dramatically during the years that the Taliban has a greater degree of control. There was also the minor scandal when Canadian troops returned and reported that they were told not to burn the poppy fields. Burning would have been logical if they were a source of funds for the Taliban.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_production_in_Afghanistan

It is far more likely that forces other than the Taliban are using the funds from heroin sales to support their black ops. Perhaps see eye eh?

-Zimbabweans appear to be quite docile and accept a lot of manure. South ASfricans since the mid 1970's have a culture of protest and rebellion."

I'm betting it is not the indigenous portion that let to the anti-gay laws, and considering Christian missions have been actively pushing anti-gay rhetoric in many African nations http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/04/world/africa/04uganda.html it is just as likely that they are responsible for the laws. 

The objective fact is Theocracies are never good for a given portion of the population. If the 1st Amendment didn't protect us from the the Family Resource Council and their ilk of ""Christianity"" we would also be a Theocracy on that list."

"""Most all""? I don't think so.  

It was funny thirty years ago when I first heard it, but there has never been much evidence to support the claim.  Most people couldn't hit the broad side of a LIO with a long gun, much less a pistol, and I've frequently seen people waving guns around with no care in the world for anyone's safety, their own included.  I've nearly been shot twice, both at ranges by someone forgetting to eject the last round from a chamber after removing the magazine.  Twice that I'm aware of.  Both of those times the weapons discharged; no one was hurt.  One guy who's gun went off while several people were downrange, actually laughed and the person next to him awarded him the coveted Black Eye of Stupidity and Failure to Know How This Danged Thing Works Medal.  Both were summarily ejected and asked not to return.

"One of the worst dangers to our democracy is that corporate media will represent any symbolic action that threatens  corporate power in such a way to as give it a ""bad rap"" with the ""mainstream"" audience, an audience that is shrinking, by the way.

Black bloc and the fascist ""alt-right"" are a sort of sideshow to the corporate takeover of our public institutions and our media. Unless public institutions reassert themselves against the ongoing corporatization of the public sphere, radical groups will soon realize the futility or trying to get their message out. even through acts of symbolic violence.

They will then arrive at the next stage in radicalization: direct action against the institutions of power.  And when they do this, everyone will rapidly realize how fragile the social order actually is. I don't support the corporatist status quo, but neither am I a fan of the puerile futility of  Black Bloc."
"I find it interesting that whenever anyone mentions diversity, the counter response is tokenism and lower or a lack of qualifications. Why is this? Are you saying that people of color and/or women aren't qualified and are just mere tokens? 

Ms. Costales took a stand to bring attention to the lack of diversity of members of the selection panel. When the people making the decisions lack diversity, they tend to select people who are similar to themselves. We have a long history of discrimination against people of color and women in this country and anyone who condones the perpetuation of the lack of diversity is the problem."

"What a joke. Black Lives Matter is a domestic terror organization that incites violence against cops.

Deal with these incidents on an individual in-house basis, do not destroy a person, and put a chill on free speech and interpersonal relations."
"I'm watching the video & the situation was bad all around. I didn't like seeing the one lady with her arms crossed & her attitude. In fact many of the people involved I feel were inappropriate, but I think Bishop could have handled his attitude better. Using the ""f"" word was inappropriate & made him look bad & I think he made a threat if he was touched. Bishop seemed like a nice guy. He doesn't look like a punk or bad boy type. I don't see this as a racist issue. I do see it as an issue that some people don't like rap music & stereotyped this particular group. He did embarrass himself when he used the ""n"" word. Also the fact that he is running his mouth on & on has resulted in him saying some things that put him in a bad light. The whole situation was handled very poorly in my opinion. If it had been a racist issue then why was the other black woman performer not asked to leave. The situation is certainly not worth having a race riot. If I were him I'd  hire a lawyer."
"Black bears are like rats. Meaning they easily take up habitation amongst human kind. In my memory black bears have killed and eaten a couple of people beyond the events of last week. Brown bears usually do not feel comfortable amongst human kind. That said, it bears pointing out that we (humans) are dealing with an intelligent complex critter whenever we speak of bruins. Always remember that Bears respect size and force. Don't be a shrinking violet, remind the bear in question that you are the dominate creature. Carry an appropriate defensive weapon (most hand guns are of little value) THAT YOU ARE  CAPABLE OF HANDLING ( think muscle memory) and practice sound judgment whenever in bear country.   Running and biking bring you into the bears immediate domain quickly and shorten both the bears reaction time and yours.  Most bears do not want a fight and will seek escape. However you must be prepared."

Do the honorable thing, if you have any honor, step down, retire or find another profession.   No sympathy and no excuses for anyone who uses their power and position to abuse the rights of others.

I believe that the 2nd amendment is a God-given right. It's not about deer hunting, that is a stupid.

That's not true. The NFL is largely African Americans who believe they are targeted unfairly in the U.S. just because they are Black. And now almost all players are showing their disgust for the POTUS.

"""...a half-century ago that was precipitated by the Democratic Party's decision to support the equal rights of African Americans.""    -that's historically false. The Democratic Party has attempted to block and impede all efforts to desegregate and integrate African Americans and impart those respective rights to vote-- up to and through ""a half century ago.""
.
AND What's more-- once Democrats accepted the fact that blacks' right to vote and integrate into significant segments of society was a certainty, they shifted their focus to instead implementing as MANY Liberal Socialist policies as they could onto them, this ensuring: A) votes and B) social dependence for decades to come.  Baltimore, Detroit, and Chicago are modern-day casualties of those failed social programs.

Because we as a society must have someone to blame for what happens.  We can't blame the dead so instead we turn toward someone alive and in power and say, ""hey this is your fault?""

"I'm convinced that campus ""diversity"" is a concept that is more prized as an icon than as a actual social reality.

I attended one of the most liberal universities, and was curious about how diversity would affect campus life.

"So that there is no misunderstanding about what I'm trying to say here:

1) I'm not comparing Trump to the Hitler of the Holocaust or to the ways in which Hitler consolidated power. I'm simply comparing Trump's campaign to the young Hitler's campaign from 20 years before the first gas chambers. As outlined in the piece, they used strikingly similar rhetoric. 

2) While there were some anti-semitic overtones to his campaign, the real danger has been the demonization of minority groups and immigrants. 

3) There has already been a 78% rise in violence against Muslim American's since his candidacy began and there have been 200 recorded hate crimes since the election, the large majority of which are anti-black, anti-immigrant, and anti-muslim. To be clear, this rise in hate crimes dwarfs the violence shown by a few anarchist protestors who are capitalizing on the anti-Trump protests to spread their message of anarchic chaos."
"Unfortunately, we all live in a country where the Constitution protects free speech.  That is ALL FREE SPEECH, not just the speech you agree with.

As for your apparent hatred of our president and expectation of a ""perfect"" world where everything you want comes true, well sorry to burst your bubble, but it ain't going to happen.  So best you grow up and start dealing with reality and acting like an adult.  Talk to people who disagree with your point of view, because your prejudices will be the only thing you stand to lose.

"President Obama's legacy has been a debt-fueled recovery at home, and chaos overseas. A master of public presentation, he always sounded and looked more together than he ever was. The decisive moments of his presidency include the bail outs of the financial services industry and backdoor bail-outs to the world's central banks (including Canada's), implementing the flawed Obamacare health reforms, and the long war against America's enemies in order to keep the dollar afloat. Being half black was never the great accomplishment or landmark as some claimed: America has long had blacks in high levels of office and that has never changed the fundamentals relating to black social and family failure."

The freeways were narrow and obsolete so no one wanted to drive on them and this kept people living in the part of town they were from.  I, for one, stayed in an area of six square miles.  Going outside that area seemed like going from Europe to America in the 16th century.  Everyone I knew was a democrat and the only minorities we ever saw came up Thackeray St. in busses to work and steal in our homes.  Many didn't want them in their houses because these workers would pilfer kids toys, the silverware, jewels, or whatever they could get their hands on if it wasn't nailed down.  My mother lost our yardman because she paid into social security for him and he told her he had never paid income taxes and was afraid of the IRS."
"Oh, so it's okay for tRump's campaign to take tens of millions from the Citizens United CBCs, huh Travis.  One that has an Alaska Court View rap sheet shouldn't be criticizing and calling someone else a crook.  That's what you call the pot calling the kettle black."
"God has spoken that apostasy shall not overcome the Light [prevail forever]; but, we are in the midst of great crisis.  The children of Christian civilization have repudiated the foundation for Blessing;...Law and [B]order.  The Truth of Liberty and Freedom has been transformed into liscence.  And now the walls have fallen for uncultured hoardes of uncivilized savages to rape, rob, and plunder.  A plague of devouring locusts sent for judgement to destroy the blessings.  JOEL 2:3
Why do the clergy cast off all fear of God?...holding to a servile sycophantic cult-like addling, mesmerized by this messiah of apostasy like rats after the pied-piper.
The Mighty God judge with fire the judas-clergy aiding and abetting this globalist criminal enterprise.....or, better yet, let fear have her imperfect work. Proverbs 9:10"
"Wait it  was the Russians, wait it was the North Koreans, wait it was the Chinese, wait it was granny in Topeka, wait it was ME, wait it was the Democrats, wait it was the New York Post, wait it was the New York Times, wait it was that damn Troll, Wait it was a BOT, wait it was those nasty Republicans, wait it is Jill Stein working with a BOT, wait it was Bernie the Communist, wait until January 20th, cause none of these petitions for a recount will change anything, wait for Obama to immediately begin his attacks on his legacy of corruption. Heck I think I'll wait two years and watch 23 Democrats try to get elected. 

Mean while ""back at the ranch"" there could just be some more insanity coming out of universities and their safe spaces, cry spaces,  no conservatives allowed to talk, BLM marching, shooting at Wal- Mart over parking places, sanctuary cities, sanctuary police departments, college graduates reading at the 4th and 5th grade level.
Where have all the sane folks gone? WAIT"
"Icon66, please don't be an ageist.  I am adamantly for #blacklivesmatter, LGBTQ rights, Muslim rights, immigrant rights, and more.  And I am almost 60 with a ton of wrinkles.  And yes, do to some health issues that I struggle with, I get tired sometimes.  MEANWHILE I HAVE MET SOME SHOCKINGLY RACIST YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS TOWN.  And racist middle-aged people.  Racism crosses age barriers, and always has.  So, again, being ageist is not helpful in ending bigotry, as it is also a form of bigotry."
"Actually I am intimately familial with the ""processes and politics that impact OHA""

"Thank you, Civil Beat and Brian Black.  I don't understand why most of the HR report about Chuck Totto and his entire severance agreement was posted online for everyone to see, yet barely a peep was mentioned about the new ethics ED."
"So members of Black Lives Matter are like Jesus?  Jesus was born into this world so that he could be the sacrificial lamb for everyones sins and members of Black Lives Matter spring forth from the womb to incite violence against police?

I can picture the young black boy now.  Wearing a N.W.A. T shirt and proudly singing the lyrics to their most popular song at a underground anti police lemonade stand at the ripe age of three.

Good job on the hyperbole bud!  I know I can always count on you."
Cause black lives matter man !!!!
"Here come the Russian trolls/ignoramuses. Let's start with Trump's exhaustively documented discrimination against blacks at Trump properties.

"I sat in my conservative evangelical church, maybe the last person to move from a pew.  This was within the week that President Bush announced the attack on Iraq.    I had thought it a silly rumor, not possible, but there it was.

I sat crying until the pastor saw me and asked if I was OK.  I wasn't.  I saw the deaths of thousands about to happen for what reason? It was as obvious to me it was a 'murder for oil' plan.  

The US could care less, (much like we do with the majority of South America and Africa), about the Muslim poor in the Middle East or the atrocities of Saddam. (We certainly ignored genocide in Africa more than once).   Nope, the heart of American foreign policy has always been a locked safe full of gold and it takes Oil to keep it filled.

It's hypocritical for me to blame American foreign policy for abuse, when all Americans, have enjoyed the financial rewards of stripping natural resources from other nations.  I plead guilty of trusting The Party."
"Kizsla, what have we been doing over the last 50 years or so?  Don't we have 'affirmative action' for blacks?  Isn't extra credit on SAT scores for blacks something?  How about quotas for black hiring?  Quotas for contracts, private and government for  minority owners, anything yet Kiszla?  Black Miss America?  The Black Caucus?  Nothing Mark?  

What would make me delighted, would be be to see them all do without those huge paychecks for a couple of years, then see how 'angry' they are....."
"Let's talk about the freedom to indoctrinate children with supernatural claims. Sure, parents have the right to express their religion, but as Dawkins has so famously pointed out, children are not born, for example, Christian children, but the children of Christian parents.
The state may try to protect children from indoctrination with beliefs such as ""Blacks are bad"" or ""Women are chattels"" but when it comes to ""There is a magic universe creating agent who watches you all the time"" or ""This statue of a man being tortured to death on a cross is actually representative of something good"" the state backs away.
I support the notion that children be educated about religion, otherwise it's difficult to understand the behaviour of some of our fellows, but schools are rightly prevented from
promoting one set of crazy beliefs over another. Thus the freedom of religion is also the freedom from religion. If reliant on strength of argument to convince skeptical youth how long would religion last?"
"Without a doubt a tragic turn of events, but I honestly cannot understand how this specific incident is being used as a prime example of a racially motivated ""murder"" by Toronto police officers. There is no denying there are widespread issues down south, but in Toronto? Come on.

We all put our trust in these brave men/women's hands to keep us safe on a daily basis and exhibit judgement in stressful situations that you or I are simply not equipped to deal with.

Andrew Loku was picked up by officers an hour earlier and accompanied safely home, an hour later he's endangering the lives of his neighbours and refuses to follow simple instructions by the officers on scene. Bottom line, if you don't comply, you are putting them in an impossible situation and yourself in danger. In this case, albeit a tragic outcome, this was justified use of force without a shadow of a doubt. BLM's insistence that this case was somehow racially charged will only further discredit them."
They have to make sure that they are gender neutral and do not conflict with the LGBTQ community as well as BLM.
"Unfortunately, most of the Trump supporters seem to hate liberals, or even moderates, more than they love their country.  If Trump's actions were undertaken by a Democrat, especially an African-American and/or a woman, these same people would be running around with their hair on fire, just as instructed to by Fox News.  Trump is an embarrassment to our country. The Republican Congress looks the other way just because they are so excited about the chance to push through their Ayn Rand inspired agenda."
"Oberg??  Really?? I would have rather seen Estevez get the call up, but I know the Rox want to keep him closing (for now) in AAA in case they lose Holland next year. Right now, the only Rox relievers I feel pretty comfortable with are Rusin, Dunn, Holland and Neshek. We'll see if Chatwood stays in the pen...I think Black is tempted to move him back into the rotation."
"He is a throwback all right, with cave man attitudes toward women, a slaveholders attitude toward black people, and an expressed hatred toward Mexicans and Muslims. We ended slavery 150 years ago. Men like Trump didn't do that.

You nor anyone else is a ""slave"" to ""political correctness"", which is a nasty meme intended to demonize respect toward all people, no matter their differences to or with you. I have seen a lot of people who practice disrespect - we call them ""rude"" or sometimes ""jerks"". But you aren't enslaved, you can be as rude as you want. And the person to whom you are rude can punch you in the nose. See? Freedom! No slavery!"
"We know very little about what Trump will actually do. What we do know is that he likes to incite people and this message struck a cord with the electorate. What scares me is he never takes responsibility for anything, meaning he is always in need of scapegoats. Historically, this has been women, Jews, blacks, Hispanics and LGBT."
"When Canada was formed did the Canadians take a vote amongst all inhabitants of the land? Obviously the people of Catalan do not need consent from Spain to be free. Their ""constitution"" is nothing more than a flawed set of laws that must be ignored. I guess you think American black people should be considered as 3/5 of a person because the US constitution said so (Article 1, Section 2, Paragraph 3). Constitutions are not absolute or eternal."
"Cannot help thinking that the fallout from the pedophilia scandal that we as Roman Catholics are still trying to get over pales by comparison to the one for which we would only have ourselves to blame if we, as Church, did not promote St. Maurice to the nation.  The number of suicides by victims of predatory priests is, thank God, infinitesimally small when measured against the more than five thousand young black males annually claimed by ""urban"" violence.

Because of Protestant denominations' unfamiliarity and discomfort with our own hagiographical traditions and sensibilities, I've long believed that the reintroduction and popularizing of this black saint to be a uniquely Roman Catholic obligation and one that grows ever more desperate and increasingly urgent.

"condemn acts of violence, intimidation, and the fostering of hate.

since when is a march an act of violence, intimidation,  and ""fostering of hate""?
blm fosters a lot of hate, is often violent, and intimidates people, at least thats what i saw when the blm crashed a ryerson faculty meeting, and when the Charlotte counter protestors didnt need a manifesto or nazi ideology to practice their violence.

i wonder if uoft would be so quick to shut down muslim and anti-semitic 'fostering of hate"" speeches and propaganda on campus."
"CFHR is a religious based entity as you note.....SPLC, the Anti Defamation League, et al are US non profits with an extensive  history of protecting the civil rights of ""classes of citizens"" .....Jews, blacks, women, gays etc....from ""class discrimination"".... If the Church was discriminating  hostilely against a ""class""  in the US  then I would certainly identify that as a hateful....and if the UN was attempting to protect the rights of gays and CFHR was objecting...I would find that hateful too....."
"I reserve the right to put whatever make-up I want on my face.  If I dress up as George Washington or Michael Jackson, I mean no disrespect.  In fact, emulation can generally be viewed as evidence of admiration.  I am truly sorry that there are so many sick people out there that think black is intrinsically offensive and that is exactly what is being said in disparaging black make-up."
"At first. But after that? Black and Green can co-exist, but, yes, the weaning has come."
"""And if you think disenfranchisement of women, men without significant property, and people of color who also happen to be slaves indicates 'a pretty good assessment of human nature'""
Eric, you left out a significant part of my post: ""...it seems to me they had a pretty good assessment of human nature with regard to government."" Specifically,  federal government will grow ever more invasive with tentacles reaching into many if not every aspect of corporate and private life if not specifically constrained via enumerated powers. It's true that some of our founding fathers trusted and desired a strong central government, but the fears of the others is strongly represented in our Constitution.
As to my absurd response, it was tongue-in-cheek meant to counter your assignment of absolute responsibility for ALL calamities: ""...whatever calamities befall us over the next three to seven years."" Of course republicans have no such power, nor do democrats who have spawned their own calamities."
Yep.  I remember years ago reading excerpts from Columbus' journals that clearly stated he took Gambian Muslims with him as interpreters to communicate with the black folks he found in the Bahamas when he landed there.  Never once saw those excerpts referred to in any 'history' book--certainly not the ones foisted on us in school.
"You seem to be implying that African-Americans are not rational, civilized people who understand the concepts of free speech and rule of law. If so, don't be coy. Spit it out.

By the way, the Jewish Defense League seems to have not gotten the memo about how they're supposed to eschew violence. I'm sure they'd welcome some guidance on the matter."
"As a HART Rail Consulting party I attended a meeting on Tuesday about how the histories around each station would be presented. There was barely ANY mention of the very rich Hawaiian history of the Ewa Plain and Honouliuli. In fact the HART Rail plans to focus on Japanese Internment as the primary historic feature of West Oahu, Ewa Honouliuli. It's the victimizing of Japanese thats the history feature...
.
Then as we move to Waipahu, there isn't any mention of the plantation era, ranches, numerous springs, shark goddess, it's Quonset Hut 33 where apparently a few black sailors
were involved in the ""Honolulu Race Riots"" of WW-II.  A small footnote in WW-II history because the CENTRAL FOCUS of HART Rail Station ""history"" - more VICTIMS of RACISM is what rail rider tourists will learn. 
.
The few Hawaiians attending the meeting asked why there was little IF ANY stories about Hawaiians - particularly positive stories of people, places. Hawaiian history NOT important,
especially good stuff"
"murder by police.  No one disputes that.  But genuine concern for black lives would also evince alarm over the huge number of the black on black murders.  On that subject, however, BLM is silent."
"There have always been people who hate and they look for something to focus on so newcomers or anyone different is a target. Religions by their nature demonize the other, after all there is a chosen people, a hell for non believers and a host of other reasons to hate heathens, of course most practitioners today do not act this way at least here. The murderer in Quebec will turn out to be a mentally damaged person just like all the other mass murderers.The talking heads are already trying to use the deaths of innocents to promote their beliefs. The killer will be called a terrorist because there is political mileage to be gained just like calling it a hate crime and then claiming all Muslims are targets. There are those who want to prevent any debate or questioning of issues they support. I support immigration but i see problems with how we manage it and i have problems with having two passports or more. Of course my opinion does not matter because of my skin color or my sex or whatever"
"As I recall it, blacks were excluded from mainstream Mormonism until late last century when the church leadership had a ""revelation"" that anti-black doctrine was in fact incorrect.

Would it not be nice if Islam's highest religious authorities had a revelation to the effect that any and all exhortation in Islamic scripture to kill non-adherents of the faith were spurious and that any people who acted on those exhortations betrayed their faith."
"I think these are good questions, CAE. It's important to remember that prior to VII, priests were not trained to think of themselves as Ministers, but as intermediaries between God and humankind, performing holy rituals and maintaining a ""sacred"" lifestyle. Although many made the transition to ministry, many more have not, and they seems to be growing in numbers.

Interestingly, the Church in Africa knows exactly how to minister to black people, so it seems to be a question of training and culture."
"Well, okay, but ""lip service"" seems off to me when talking about Obama. I think his connection with Christian beliefs, especially in a ""blacker"" church, is more based in the spiritual importance of human actions (the ""doing"") and he sees governmental action as action involving people to help each other--a very basic American idea of community engagement."
"FDR was racist. He put thousands of Japanese Americans in camps and took their property. There are also records of him verbally denigrating Jews. If you and your self righteous ilk want to start erasing this county's history then be consistent. How astonishingly hypocritical of you to think Japanese Americans are less important to our nation's history than blacks. How astonishingly ignorant of you to think it's ""false equivalence"" to compare two wrongs perpetrated on our people by our government and call one less wrong than the other. I suppose you are a fan of the democrat Andrew Jackson too. Was what he did to the American Indian less wrong than slavery?
 Stop the hypocrisy and start adhering to the rules of this so called civil comments."
"I'm sorry not to see my parish listed. But not surprised, I guess. Our pastor is extremely liberal in his outlook, carefully inclusive in all his remarks, and would, I am confident, be completely welcoming to all.  I think one reason there is not a particularly visible LGBTQ presence in our church is that Black LGBTQ people have a lot of difficulties in the general community, and there is much less broad support for mainstreaming than one finds in more privileged communities. 

There's a Black protestant church not far away, that is, I am told, THE church to belong to, as an LGBTQ person of color. I attended a sad and difficult funeral there, and was moved and impressed by the way the pastor spoke to the conflicted responses of those attending. A woman pastor, with great gifts. If I was queer and Black,  and looking for a community of worship, I imagine I would be drawn there, rather than undertaking missionary work in a Catholic church."
"In my post below:  In the article, the cop already contradicted himself (swereing, looking for a black car, than the burglary), and the EPD could not validate his claim of a burglary in the area. Therefore I believe he lied."
"Perhaps we should not have sold our manufacturing arm to China and India, at what price, I wonder.  I have heard of actual cases where imports of African manufacture were stopped because the Chinese had preference.  Perhaps our government's trade negotiations should come under the spotlight before we plan more manufacture that will simply fail because we cannot compete with Chinese and Indian slave labour and ""dirty"" coal powered manufacturing tactics."
"The only thing these protesters are to do is hurt the NFL and the NFL fans. The NFL is going to lose viewers and merchandise sales while the NFL supporters are going to lost a relaxing national past time because some spoiled racists decided to disrespect the flag and the country it stands for. By supporting these radical racists the NFL has made a serious business blunder, but they are the ones who will have to live with it. 
As for protesters nothing will come for their actions because their demands are for other to change while they continue to do the same. The same 70% of black births to single moms, the same black on black murders, the same gangsta attitude and the victim mentality indoctrination."
Say what? That would be pot calling the kettle black wouldn't it.
"""and Goebbels Cheney""

You don't get it.  The Cheney ship sailed away with Hillary.  She was the neoconservative interventionist.  She wanted a no-fly zone in Syria and war with Russia.  That's not happening anymore because Trump won.  He wrecked those plans.  He upset the established order of permanent war in the Middle East.  He decided to ally with Russia against the terrorists.  

I know, I know, ""our allies.""  Poor Saudi Arabia cannot accomplish their goals.  Their $20 million donation to the Clinton Foundation was based upon their honest, genuine, heartfelt support for women's rights and gay rights in Africa.  I'm sure.  

I'm sorry that the ""evil dictator"" is still in power in Syria.  If only we could have ""spread democracy"" there like we did in Iraq and Libya.  Those were such glorious and righteous causes!  If only we could have let the radical Islamic jihadists take over Syria too, then everything would be so much better like it is in Mosul or Benghazi!"
"Remarkable that Jesus had nothing to say about abortion or same-sex marriage, both of which existed in his time also, and very little to say about remarriage after divorce, about which we find a plethora of divergent and hard opinions.  For the most part, Jesus left the black-letter law to the lawyers, about whose pharisaical attitude Jesus had more to say, especially that we should not get caught elevating ourselves above the sinners of our day and pretend that we are better than they are.  So Jesus shared food with these sinners in an obvious act of friendship, and even endured scoldings from his disciples.  That's enough right there to make me and many others think that archbishops should befriend sinners and maybe even have a burger with them.  That could explain why McDonald's is looking at a possible Vatican site.  Oh Happy Meal!  Ah!  Happy Meal!"
"I value Obama for his efforts to mostly keep us out of new foreign wars.  The economy would likely have progressed about the same regardless of who was president.  The jury on Obamacare is still out.  It did nothing to control costs and even left alone would likely be unsustainable because of the rocketing costs.  Besides, just look at the family recently highlighted in the RG basically begging for funds to support their child's skull fixing operation.  The child was identified as being insured by Obamacare.  It was also important to have a partially black President."
"Take off your blinders, Trump was elected to undo the eight years of Obama. Obama was the one cozying up to our adversaries like Iran, and the Muslim brotherhood. Throwing Israel, one of our most loyal ally,  under the bus doesn't speak well for leadership. 
Supporting the BLM (Black lies Murder) is hardly about equal rights and forcing religious organization to pay for morning after pills isn't much of a uniting action. We should have never even considered agreeing to the TPP and the Paris Climate Accord was a disaster. 
Allow with Obamacare correcting these issue is what got Trump elected, even though you don't like that is the bottom line."
"Citation?

"No mistaken sentiment, ""just the facts ma'am"" as Detective Friday would say! 



I didn't say that about the Confederacy, I stated it was a ""integral part of our nation's history"" and went on to say that ""History should stand as it is, told as it happened, and be something to reflect on with truth."".



 Did I lie about the Democratic Party, or did I tell the truth about their history back then? Did I lie about President Johnson's extreme racism concerning black people? Ain't but one party own that history back then. 


Leopards don't change their spots, they find new ways to hunt. The Democratic Party is the Master of the New Plantation of government control over the individual, in my opinion respectfully OZZIEL.

Been a good discussion, even in disagreement there is much to enjoy in such civil discourse and personal respect for others of differing views, thank you for that!"
"Phew man, Andrew!  I have also suffered big mental abuse and physical injury, during a hugely, failed marriage, and my poor children suffered as a result of that history.  How? Are we going to educate the mass of South Africans to value and respect women, and children too,  instead of always, always,  using them as a battering ram on which to relieve their own, frustrations. Tribal custom is also a serious issue here.  Grew up in the Transkei, so I have been a witness to the atrocities committed by the Xhosa men upon their women. Abuse is an accepted norm, amongst the amaBantu.  Now go on,  tell me I am a racist!!"
"You just did by saying they went into the bakery with an agenda.  Many movements started with ""agendas"", and as such, it should not diminish what happened.  

Gays like to compare their movement to blacks because it is the most relevant movement from recent history which comes anywhere close to what they are trying to do.  Is it the same?  No.  The history of blacks in America is horrifying and not really anything close to what is going on now.  However, can you name me another point in American history when a specific subgroup of people were being denied services based on things like ""religion"" or beliefs that was not later determined to be unjust?"
"Wasn't there an uproar some years ago when a Koran, at Gitmo, was flushed down a toilet? And isn't the Koran a symbol. The same side that called that DISRESPECT, is the same side that is now defending to actions of the players. The statement by the Broncos that this isn't DISRESPECT, of the flag, the military, or the police, is BS, if that's the case then why do it to begin with. And why do it during the National Anthem?

Can anyone explain how taking a knee, during the National Anthem, by rich professional athletes, many who have gotten out of inter-city black neighborhoods, help those in inter-city black neighborhoods? This is akin to all the ribbons liberals wore to show they cared more. But did one ribbons cure or make something better? And what exactly IS social justice? That everyone is treated fairly? If that the case why then are there protective classes? This action has always been about disrespect, not about accomplishment."
"But yes, lets talk about casual racism. When Yusra Khogali stands at the edge of a crowd at a free speech rally on the property of the university where she attends as a student and is caught on camera hurling racial slurs at a black man who happens to have the microphone and is issuing a speech which she disagrees with should that not be considered an overt act of racism that needs to be called out? That university has anti racism fever yet a blatant racial attack such as the one I just mentioned goes unaddressed just because administrators there have decided not to enforce their own rules based on the racial make- up of the offending party despite there being clear evidence of the offence is about as racist as it gets."
"Yes, Social stratification by wealth is color-less.  Some people of color who I have met are totally the most uppity when they have bucks.  ""Oh. My God, look at that girl, she's country""  In many brown nations, the darker you are the less you have social status.  I have seen examples in my travels.  The elites in these countries think that it is normal to use and abuse the average person.  Many in the 3rd world are conditioned to think they are ""less"" that the elites.  If you are American and have not traveled, you cannot fathom the difference between here and there."
"It is kind of hilarious how the MSM and left loons went crazy over whether Harper at end of term was either 1 billion to the good or 1 billion in the red. Between CBC Global CTV  and Star there was 5000 hours spent broadcasting Duffy 90,000 deal that got paid back and crickets by same entities reporting on Turdo lying to the tune of 100 billion on his promise of 10 10 4 and last year balanced.

Then we have the left loons blasting Harper for having deficit years. In terms of population we added 
1/6 of the debt as USA and a fraction of what the other G7 added. While we were squabbling about either a billion to black or red the USA was adding 1/2 a trillion to go along with close to 10 trillion over last 8 years. 

Now we have Jr on training wheels spending money  like his daddy. Having all the left loons come over from Queens Park to tell him how to flush the toilet. After putting Ontario on their feet and taking that to the ROC. Everyone was driving a Cadillac and now they are walking"
"No, you do not have the right to express your opinion on this epaper. You have the privilege of doing so. This is a business and your comments have to meet the standards of the ownership of this business.
Harassing any citizen for crimes they have committed and having served their time, is prejudice, reflective of ill behaviour appealing to the base intellect.   It makes you look bad, not Black."
"I know whose restaurants I won't knowingly eat in. I am a man with money to spend, but  obviously she does not  seek my custom.  She insults all men and thinks its good business?  

  Black Hoof,  and Grey Gardens   in Kensington Market.   Do her male staff know how much she begrudges them?"
"No one in the US government wants war, few if any of the rest of the world community want a war.

No one wanted a war in Europe in the '30's....unfortunately two individuals did, Hitler and Stalin,  both conspired to precipitate WWII.

Just like Hitler and Stalin, there is one person in North Korea who may well want to precipitate a war .

He is the one with ICBMissiles , he who has nuclear war heads, who has been testing his missiles by shooting them over Japan and has threatened repeatedly to shoot his missiles to hit the USA and its allies.

If he initiates a war, President Trump would, quite rightly, end it."
"I feel for the black Lady who was given a Post to be a CEO of a dyin Company her reputation is gone, how do you jump into hot seat."
"It appears that you don't have a problem with hate. I just wonder with what variety of hate you're comfortable as there are different kinds. As examples, there are those who hate black people, those who hate green beans, and those who hate taxes; all different kinds of hate. Specifically, what sort of hate do you think is beneficial, justified, or at a minimum to be tolerated?
President Trump is brash, impulsive, a product of the American male subculture, wealthy, ruthless, etc.; in short, a really genuine human being with foibles, warts, and all, rather than the cultured saints we've had as our presidents in the past. I think his wealth and now his fame/notoriety amplifies and spot lights his faults. So is he deserving of hate because he's got all these significant faults just as many of us less wealthy, less famous people have?"
Republicans have never had near the majority of Hispanics or African Americans.  Not likely to either.
"Had he made this comment about an African American, a Latino or a GLBT, he would have been fired on the spot...it's still ok to make racially insensible remarks about Asians (see Colbert or Biden)"
"What're you talking about, jendal?  It's a cake walk alright.  Wait and see. Nothing but a tiny bump in the road.  Women, blacks, and Hispanics have Hillary's back.  The Rs know it and soon tRump will know it.  Nasty women will be coming out of the woodwork."
They never give suspect descriptions because 90% of the time it is a black man or people of color. They don't want to make the obvious anymore obvious.
"Since Black Lives Matter obviously knows how to deal with these situations, I suggest they volunteer to be on call whenever an armed black person is threatening to harm others and BLM could come and handle the situation appropriately and show us all how it should be done."
"Why are the Republicans on the wrong side of virtually everything? 


If the cons are able to roll back net neutrality, they will be working to dismantle everything about what made the Internet great, and they may essentially break the Internet, making it the plaything of huge private tyrannies only, and killing off future innovation - at least in the United States.


I know that many cons are so racist as to want to wipe out every last bit of the black President's legacy because they are so very hateful and twisted, but they should know net neutrality existed since the dawn of the 'net, and Obama has nothing to do with it. Much like the concepts in the ACA, but that fact doesn't change their mind on ""Obamacare"" much, either."
Obama is only 1/3 black.
"Elise does another in a long line of false comparisons. Why do you actually think Trump won? It is because the left and the mainstream media continue to paint anyone who is conservative/republican as being racist. sexist and any other ist you can think of. There are also a lot of independents who know better and don't like it when a whole segment of the population is painted as ignorant racists. That includes so called establishment republicans that are no more than lukewarm democrats. The ones who told us they were going to do something to stop Obama and Obamacare and then did not do anything but lay down for the liberal agenda. They betrayed us and we got angry. Racism or sexism has nothing to do with it. Of course ever since Obama was elected, we have been painted as racist just disagreeing with any policy he puts forth, never mind that we disagree with his policies and race has nothing to do with that. If it did, then every black politician that disagrees with Trump is racist."
"The sad thing here is that companies like Swifambo (if it is really a company) reinforce the belief that BEE is a sham, and some State Owned Companies actually support this sham. It sounds like a company primarily formed to merely be a BEE partner and profit from a service into which they did not add any value. Maybe this judgement will deter those who form companies to benefit from deals just by being black."
"The whole point is to change history, not to get revenge for it.
There is nothing to show that blacks or gays are specifically mistreated by police today in Canada.
The Chief of police in Toronto is Black and the force is full of Gay officers.
Just because BLM has formed in the USA doesn't mean it belongs in Canada.
BLM and Gay pride have almost nothing in common and it is ridiculous that they share any values like this.  Public dollars should only go to events that are open to all."
"Hey Renzetti, there's a famine going on in South Sudan. Millions of people are at risk. How come you never write about that? Why will you go back to bashing Trump next week again? More important to you than millions of black lives?"

"You don't ""win"" the Medal of Honor (it's just the MOH, no Congressional), you are awarded it.  It was also counterintuitive to dump thousands of slaves into ""freedom"" to which they were wholly unprepared for.  I guess people such as Frederick Douglass, and others who reported on black combat troops fighting for the south were wrong then..even though he states he saw them, under arms, participating, as early as the 1st Battle of Bull Run.  History is written by the victors, and it sure wouldn't fit the narrative of a ""war"" to ""free the slaves"" if blacks were acknowledged as fighting on the ""other"" side.  There were free blacks in the south, and even black slave owners.  Again, economics, not racism.  As for Walter E, I suppose you COULD ask him what he's basing his statements on.., but then...are we allowed to ask liberal academics what they base their claims on?  Uh, yeah...thought not."
From his previous actions it seems like he will cave in to every demand from the black kids at the U of O.
"Well, if BLM is a success in getting cops to shoot fewer black people, and NFL loses some dollars? I'd call that a more than fair trade in the interest of progress. 


If you were a parent of a child that is at risk of being shot by cops for no particular reason than for having the ""wrong"" skin color, I think you'd prioritize BLM over the bottom line of those within the NFL.


I know it's only natural that cons value profit over people, but seriously, try to walk a mile in another's shoes, even if it's only as a mental exercise."
"I agree with most of your comment except the part about the southern racists becoming republicans. In fact, out of all of the southern racist democrats, only 3 became republicans. All of the rest remained with the democratic party. Republicans have never been supportive of segregation, then or now. The major switch between the parties was strictly due to economic theory, not race. I would also agree that the democrats embraced the ideals of Lincoln since the 60's/70's but the republicans have never left those ideals. Nothing has been done to keep blacks from voting, only to keep anyone not entitled to vote from voting. There is no evidence that voting ID laws have had any impact on anyones ability to vote."
Things weren't so bad under Eisenhower unless you were a black person living under Jim Crow.
"Quite funny this, this resistance to the suggestion to 'integrate with coloureds'. The Coloured groups always seeking association more especially with Afrikaans groups and resisted association with Blacks. We are in the dwang.

"Are you kidding me ?   While due to the new system we no longer see the faces of who's commenting , nearly all who use the racist tag are those of color or those who support them. Just as when the issue of gay rights comes up--it's the gays and their supporters calling everyone who won't go along with their agenda homophobes and bigots.   If one dares to discuss race and isn't in full agreement with the position of blacks---they are called a racist.   No wonder we can't have healing discussions on these issues."

"John Havelock said what I said but in a more indirect way. I say it directly. MIne was deleted as being uncivil. I said: It is right and good and Jesus-like to condemn the bottomless pit of the old deep south style of racism and bigotry, some of which has traveled here to the far north. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions comes from that historically ignorant pit and should be relieved of his duties. It is right and good to do so immediately. I might add that a recent study of America shows one in every six marriages are inter-racial. That is also right and good, and not an abomination as the old south believes.

John Havelock said: He presided over Alabama's criminal justice system when criminal behavior by black people was a notorious priority. Life sentences and the death penalty are common among Southern states with a high Afro-American population, including Alabama."
"Keep going---and your solution is---to go out and get all the guns .  That's what democrats really want . Do you really think American's would give up their guns ?  They want us to be like England where you can't even own a B B gun.  Alaska probably has more guns per household than any other state.  So why , with it's strict gun laws--is Chicago the worst city in America ? Or a bigger question---why do democrats scream about controlling guns when a mass murder happens yet when dozens are killed every week by blacks against other blacks in Chicago they don't utter a word ?  Democrats jump to blame the NRA yet say nothing about the blacks doing all the killing in Chicago. Why don't those black lives matter to democrats , Black Lives Matters ,  Al Sharpton , Jesse Jackson , Obama or the national media . Those deaths in Chicago amount to more than all the mass shootings put together in six months.  Last---what's your solution to ending mass shootings other than offering meaningless stats ?"

No BIGOTS need apply. Your defending bigotry by saying it is backed by religious beliefs does not differ in any way from racists who refused to serve blacks and said it was because of their religious beliefs.
"the job go to an American black.  This is a thoroughly permissible favoritism toward our own countrymen, many of whom have scraped to get out from under historical racial discrimination.  Many American blacks feel jilted by policies that have favored illegal Central American and Mexican workers.  Who can blame them for seeing this as a continuation of American racism toward blacks?"
"Sometimes, civil unrest and an extreme action is called for to get the message heard.   That you would devalue the struggle of blacks and gays to receive equal treatment under the law, by referring to them as ""malcontents"" is exactly the reason why BLM and Pride took this action.   Frankly it's bigoted to refer to minority groups as malcontents."
"Actually Kaepernick started protesting police violence against blacks by sitting on the bench during the anthem.  People told him that was disrespectful so he did the knee pose.

Kaepernick has given a million to the cause and seems to have put his career in jeopardy standing up for what he believes in.  He has dignity and those trying to minimize him and the problem of racism I think are not coming off well. 

 Trump is just a knob - a president telling a private business how to treat their employees and calling them SOBs.  And I don't believe Trump that his attack isn't informed by racism.

Cheney helped Haliburton.  The Bushes helped wall street investment banks in general.  People got rich!  America was great (until it suddenly wasn't - but that was Obama's fault because God saw horrid, black Obama was coming).  The key is what the Trump base knows.  Soon, once Trump makes America great again, and there are Trump hotels in all nations, members of the Trump base will also be rich, and have good jobs, and have better health insurance that liberals, and there will be no Muslims, and coal powered plants will make electricity free (for Trump supporters).  So, trust in Trump.  Support.  Quit crying just because Hillary lost."

When was Clinton recorded or reported as boasting about grabbing women by the crotch?

"He needs to realize two things.
1) As a buisness owner discrimination against someone's sexual orientation actually is in contradiction to the Equality Act and therefore is illegal. This was upheld by the State of Washington. So sure, open the door for lawsuits. I am sure that those lawyer expenses will do wonders on his expense ledgers
2) The freedom he has to practice his religion stops when he is trying to impose them upon others. He is providing a public service as a buisness owner. He losses the right to say he will refuse to serve anyone, based on that. 

He also needs to understand that individuals in the community can also ensure that others are made aware of his bigotry and refuse to  patronize his buisness.  And if it goes under, I would shed no tear. He can then enjoy explaining to his creditors why their investment went under. 

And for those that say he has a right to serve whomever. Replace gay with African American or Hispanic, and ask yourself does this sound bigoted?"

The niqab is synonymous with social regression and a lack of fundamental rights Canadians take for granted. It's not a coincidence that in every single country where the niqab is common that women are subjugated as second class citizens (often under the threat of violence). There is rich irony in defending the niqab while simultaneously raising concerns about homophobia and anti-semitism as wherever the niqab is common, the LGBT community face the death penalty for being outed and hostility towards Jews is a badge of honour. 
The niqab is synonymous with social regression, division, and community segregation, without exception."

Let’s get one thing straight: Paid maternity leave is not a right. I repeat, paid maternity leave is not a right. Your boss was not involved in the making of your baby, so why should they be forced to pay for your life choices?

Yes, women can be physically and emotionally abused by their partners. However, this isn’t solely a “women’s issue.” Men can also be physically and emotionally abused by their partners; they are just statistically less likely to report it.

This right is protected by the US constitution, like all of the rights in the bill of rights? These players represent the black community and they are tired of being mistreated by police and discriminated against. They don't feel safe in our communities.

Then again, if a business is serving the public, public accommodation laws, both local and federal, take effect.

There were about 5 states remaining IN the union that were slave states, (as was DC).  in 1862, the IRS began taxing slave sales in these states to help fund the war.  Since the Confederate states seceded, NONE of the individuals in them could be guilty of ""treason"" against the US!  In 1958 (I believe) the US Congress passed a law establishing ALL confederates were United States Veterans.  Up to 90000 free blacks fought for the south starting in 1861.  Free blacks in the north: not until 1863.  Slavery was only 1 issue, and even southern leaders knew it would be gone in a few decades.  Please study some history!"
"I've met and or worked with all the county commissioners going back to the 80's, unemployed timber workers including those in Cottage Grove, Republican congressman in the 90's regarding US and Africa polices, I attended town hall meeting with Senator Wyden during the birth of the Tea Party, elected Springfield politicians, EWEB management dating back to 1995, all the EPD police chiefs since the 80's, and the Eugene Chamber of Commerce. Vic Atiyeh appointed me to the Commission on Black Affairs. How many black folks do you know and or worked with? How many did you have to answer to?"
"The anthem is a song. The flag is a piece of cloth. Their significance is what they represent.  Until the late 1860's the flag represented constitutionally entrenched slavery of black Americans.Now it represents a society where de facto racism still persists to a great extent.
Taking a knee to make that point seems pretty benign to me."
"CD,  Thanks for the reply.  I'll check-out the books , ""To Protect and Serve: How to Fix America’s Police"" and ""Breaking Rank: A Top Cop's Exposé of the Dark Side of American Policing"".  As part of my reading I ran across an article where the author (a black man) wrote that racism on any scale beyond individuals and small groups really no longer exists in this country but prejudice and discrimination do.  I think I agree.  As a citizen and voter, I am looking for specific issues and specific policies that address the issues of institutional prejudice and discrimination.  I can also see specific policies/laws just being repealed as part of the process.  The problem I have with this issue is most folks speak and write in generalities on this subject.

I can understand a democrats view that defeating Trump is numero uno but I find it hard to believe that you really think Trump would or even could start WWIII if elected president."

"How many arrest did you see? Out of hundreds of black domestic terrorist rioting , looting, setting buildings on fire , attacking innocent people, destroying police cars and attacking the police, how many were arrested? When they besieged a city building and fired a gun at police , how many were arrested? When they were throwing rocks, bricks, and glass bottles at police , how many were arrested? How many blm people were murdered  at point blank range by the police during those riots?  Zero."
"for most marijuana consumers.......be they medical or recreational......it is like beer or wine.....most needs can be made right at home.....
....and with all the 'bad guys' who presently supply the black market with marijuana.....they will get very wealthy by going legitimate......as did the alcohol/beer/wine suppliers following PROHIBITION....if that is what they want to do

EITHER WAY.....legalization will free up hundreds of thousands of man-hours of police..court...and corrections  resources...

The problem is.........tests today will only indicate if someone has consumed marijuana in the last six weeks......tests do not indicate if one is under the influence of marijuana.....

Not that it matters......marijuana does not impair driving..,.as does alcohol nor hard drugs......Canadian drivers have been driving on the same roads as marijuana users since the sixties.....no problem"
"Here we go with the spurious comparisons -lack of critical thinking. Citizens have a RIGHT to vote, that's why they fought and died to get it when its been denied.  Citizens dont have a RIGHT to get on a plane.  and yes, the republicans create voter ID laws, ask for the kinds of ID they know young people, poor people, black people are least likely to have.  That's what is meant by 'surgical precision'.  BTW, its a sign of cognitive deficiency when one is incapable of making an argument without name-calling...very trump-esque though."
"Referring to these attackers as Black and/or Brown, could have racial implications !!!"
"I guess it depends on what you mean by help.  In Washington D. C. vouchers helped black students get into Sidwell Friends, the school that President Obama's kids went to, until Democrats took that away.  Are you saying vouchers didn't help black students?  Amazing!"
"What reason does anyone have to possess a firearm? What reason does a black person have in not wanting to be relegated to separate but ""equal"" facilities? Economically speaking, prohibition causes crime. First, it makes what would otherwise be legal, illegal. Second, it creates an economy void of the protections (courts and manners of redress between two parties in an economic transaction) that facilitate an organized and civil society. Three, it creates both scarcity and demand, which, in turn, cause prices to rise and the ensuing crime to acquire the ability to pay the higher prices for the good being demanded."
Hitler said that any Jewish blood (whatever that means) in your ancestry meant you had to sew a yellow star on your clothing. In South Africa any Black ancestry subjected a person to the mandates of Aparthed! And at one time in this country anyone who looked as though there was African ancestry - or Carribean ancestry - created a risk of being lynched. In Joe Arpaio's Arizona looking Hispanic subjected you to harassment. How come a drop of blood in your ancestry makes you subject to sanctions & humiliations but not having enough of a proportion of that ancestry divorces you from the so-called privileges of that ancestry. Talk about a schizophrenic notion!!
"remoore:  You don't think the NFL and NCAA will just continue on if the fan base leaves?  The NFL feels the problem right now, they are in denial why it is happening.  These uber rich players that somehow succeeded in a racist country are protesting.

Don't you see the irony.  Their message should be one of hard work pays off and to the black community, you can succeed if you work hard.  America is not fundamentally a racist country.  We have have racist people, of all colors.  Bet you didn't know that Democrat President Woodrow Wilson re-segregated the government after Republican Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves.  Or that more Republicans in Congress voted for the Civil Rights Act than did Democrats.  Facts for thought."
".... or is Black History Month more important than ever, so more people will learn about Frederick Douglass, and the history of racism?"
"Read Roth's ""The Human Stain""- Art becomes reality. In it a Professor alludes to two students who act like spies as ""spooks"",the vernacular term for spies. The students happen be black, and the professor, mistakenly denounced as racist, is pilloried in the politically correct backlash. Isn't it obvious that this was meant as a pun [albeit a bad one]  that played off Segal's title as a 'master' of the college? It would apply to anyone, regardless of colour. C'mon people-failing distinguish between real and imagined racism delutes the legitimate outrage we need to reserve for actual injustice."
"If Sanger was such a threat to blacks, why did Martin Luther King Jr. praise her during his acceptance speech of the Margaret Sanger award in 1966? If she was good enough for MLK, she is good enough for me."
"According to your logic, anyone with an agenda can claim affinity with the Black movement.  I disagree."
"Doing the Depression, when the original Gallop Polling  system was being developed the odds on favorite was the Republican running against FDR. Gallop pioneered the anonymous phone poll, asking the same questions of people regardless of  race, income or occupation. Early Gallop  polls  had FDR comfortably ahead, which was considered impossible by the news papers and Washington  elite because opinions of blacks, women, or the unemployed simply didn't count, just as they still dont count now if they support Trump."
"And you blindly believe the claims of blacks against cops - without exception - because of your own intrinsic racial animus and anti-police hatreds.

No fact is presented here."
"Not a chance mate . he still dances ANC tune .
  When questioned about pensions 'bailing out SOE's ' 
Escom is a well run company , and they might raise capital through the issue of 'bonds' . To be paid in 10-15-20 years time . 
   So , the biggest pension fund in the country can be relied on to make prudent , fiscally good investments . ? 
   After all , it will affect Cyril's pension payout too . 
We know how that can turn out , and am sure he could manage without it . 
   A well run Escom , seriously ? That's junk bond status already . 'Have only used R250m of the R350m guaranteed .....by the taxpayer . 
   Where is Tokyo  ? 
He is doing OK , how many black jobs has he and Cyril created ? 
   Adam , its not 8 years , its 20+ !"
"The book is political and nothing close to an  impartial study of these problems.   Look at the authors credentials  (lack of) if you doubt it.  

My conflict comes from the fact that Republicans have offered nothing to the black community of significance.   The absurd claim that the poor have anything close to equal opportunity is just a self-righteous excuse that keeps them from seeing their clear advantages.  Combine the oppressive nature of poverty, with the clear negative stereotyping of black people and you have a witch's brew that kills opportunity. 

There is a long list of failed policies, (mostly Democratic initiatives) that have not addressed the root causes of poverty.    In some cases policy has institutionalized poverty.  Many of these policies were made with good intentions but poor design and little accountability to the goal of lessoning poverty.

These are serious issues that should be addressed.  

The bigotry of political ideology cripples rational policy making."
"By all means. You are currently allowed to go to most any bar and smoke your stogies in their designated smoking areas. My guess is that a cigar only bar would not be financially viable; however, I do not envision many pot only bars being able to remain in the black (profitable) for very long either."
"""But the momentary tension was defused when one of the Trump rally organizers invited them onstage and offered one of them a microphone."" -To let BLM speak their mind.
In sharp contrast to the left, especially the alt left and the terrorist group Antifa whom do not believe in freedom of speech and stomp on opposing views at every opportunity, even using violence."
"The person at fault was DOJ Investigator James Williams, whose innate(?) bias led him to investigate #BlackLivesMatter, then to mistake a graphic of a black man in sights for a police officer.
He got $70K, reinstatement, and back pay thanks to an arbitrator; quite a reward for being drastically wrong."
"Tell me......

Don't you think it's a little ironic that the same people that want to see Confederate monuments remain, and get huffy at the thought of them being taken down are usually the same folks that like to tell black Americans to get over slavery?  It seems to me that the defenders of the Confederacy seem to be stuck in the past...a past that never was what they think it was."
"Assuming you have checked your facts as well as you normally do, what would you focus on to reduce the number of black deaths?   

Will a police strategy of aggressiveness toward all blacks stop the use of violence in the communities or just reinforce it?   

Why hasn't the almost unchecked purchase of weaponary worked to slow the violence?"
"Reminds me of that 80's movie Revenge of the Nerds when the nerds played that song during a party for a black fraternity...

Some are always ready to defend the rich and powerful against those trying to survive and keep their communities.  The police defend the rich and powerful and were doing so during this protest which was defending the black community.
"These ""demands"" are doing more harm than good.  Isolated cases of rudeness are blown out of proportion and blur the reality that everyone gets bumped-around by the vagaries of life once in a while, me too.  I try not to take it too personally.  One more thought:  The percentage of blacks in Lane County is 1.1% and 2.1% in the entire state.  If I really wanted to be exposed to black culture, I'm not sure if Oregon is the place I would go."
Whether Lincoln wanted to deport blacks after the war is irrelevant. Tell us about other irrelevant things Lincoln wanted to do. Did he want to see the Great Wall of China before he died? How about ride in a hot air balloon? Eat a hot dog in Coney Island?
"This is a long over do step toward providing equal protection under the law. It has taken 150 years to get to this point. The data will help improve policies and procedures. I appreciate the effort. When I came here in 1975 to attend the UO, the EPD kept a photo book of all black men that were in town more than a week. It was found by a black student interning at the EPD in the 1980's. My picture was in the book. I was stopped within a half hour of arriving. I was on foot, having arrived by air."
"Student newspaper outraged that someone (not Nish) opined that the diversity committee was not diverse.  Because:  lack of diversity is not an issue if it benefits black folk, apparently.   Nish agrees.  Seems to be a perfect fit for PCC."
The national anthem stands for a country that embraced slavery and discrimination toward blacks. Do you mean that national anthem and that country?
"I don't know what 'black privilege' means, but George Soros record is clear for this election year.

 ""New York financier George Soros has spent or committed more than $13 million to support Hillary Clinton and other Democrats this election cycle, already more than his total disclosed spending in the last two presidential elections combined.""

His son also donated $1 million three days ago through the Planned Parenthood PAC for Hillary.  (That tax free corporation has put $20 million toward her campaign, of course.)"
"Palatable, handle the diction duties and provide a suitable word replacement. BTW, hate is not the argument. Instead, it's that there is no known problem with transgenders serving in the military. Over and over we've seen your kind say that allowing blacks, women, gays, et al., serve in the military would cause a significant problem, yet these people have served and there is no problem. So Trump's ban on transgender in the military is the problem. Again, it's the Trump's bans that are the problem. Get your GED and learn to understand what you read."

"Indeed...at least before the absentee and military ballots are counted. :-)

But you're missing point.  She got the majority of black and Latino votes, no doubt.  But more Latinos voted for Trump then did for Romney.  She abandoned her middle class working Democrats....and many of them voted for Trump...just as she was warned.

Can you even begin to imagine what would have happened if a truly likable Republican was running against her?  You may want to recall the Reagan elections.  This is something the Democrats are going to have to assess - you cannot abandon your base and think they're going to stand by you."
"Do you know one, just one, family who lives a traditionally native subsistence lifestyle? No alcohol, no cigarettes, hunts and fishes the traditional way?  I don't think so.  Ethnically mixed means many have different traditions and cultures.  Most have ancestors who never lived a subsistence or even semi subsistence lifestyle in the near past so why do many claim they do.   Like anywhere USA they have Asian, African, European ect ancestors. Can we be selective and only claim the one that you get the most benefits from? If the native store does not have what you want you can order it today. It is more expensive as it should be when you choose to live far from amenities. The growing of ones food and raising livestock is the epitome of real subsistence living.  This has helped so many cultures to progress to where they are at today. America would not be were it is at if we had to buy or trade for all our food.  Even cave men progressed from the help farming to supplement their diet."
"Trump can't get by the FACT (that word seems to be missing from his vocabulary) that not only 3 million more people voted for Hillary than for him, that same 3 million people chose a woman over him. Add to that the FACT that the outgoing president, who is a black man, had a popularity rating of 60%, while at the same time Trump's popularity was at 32% and falling. Incidentally, these are the ""original facts"", I have yet to see the ""alternative facts"" regarding these issues."
"Good point, Chris.  But what to do?  Boko Haram is a truly odious organization.  Providing weapons to Nigeria is fraught with risk; a significant portion of all African aid ends up lining the pockets of black marketeers, corrupt governments, or both.  Add automatic weapons or grenade launchers to that list and you have disaster waiting to happen.

On the other hand, if he sends military support – even training – the move will be seen as imperialist by most of the world, and war-mongering by the far left.  I don’t like or trust Trump, but there are some wingnuts out there who would vilify him even if he brokered Middle East peace and reunited Led Zeppelin.

And to do nothing is perhaps the worst choice of all.  We are speaking of an organization that kidnaps and enslaves children for political ends."
"What is happening in Anchorage is going on all over the country. They put on the mask of altruism and pretend to care about the homeless but they are actually trying to contain them into one area. Then they are treated like animals. BFS is abusive, mismanaged and full of bed bugs. The women are placed in areas of lots of light and noise, it is very unhealthy. In all of these co-ed shelters there is very little supervision of behaviors. 
The systems that deal with the homeless are based on racism. When the Clinton crime bill and welfare destruction happened devastating the black inner city areas they then placed a large number of police in the area to arrest as many as possible, they do the same in these areas where the homeless are concentrated. Note the security guards downtown for the purpose of running off the homeless. The systems are not in place to help the homeless, they are there to manage the homeless who are the left over people they could not get or keep in the prisons."
How embarrassing for the Germans!
"Actually, Sara, no, not within the way you think so, anyway.

I really do not know what you believe the 1950's were, so you shall have to tell me, though I suspect strongly that it will have to do with the female role within society.

Now let us look unto the modern, or current realm of the female role within society, shall we?

Females consist of more high paying jobs than males do, within management, lawyers,doctors,small business owners, and approaching CEO's, etc.

So what is it that you want?

A female President?

Fine.

As I stated unto a supervisor in 2007, who was a liberal, asked me point blank if I believed if this Nation was ready for a black President, unto which I responded of course, but not this one.

Should they have presented the same query as unto a female President, I would have responded the same, as of course, but  not this one.

First, and foremost, I support Libertarians.

Secondly, true Conservatives.

And I shall never support a progressive, nor Liberal. Ever."
"Thank you once again for the thoughtful take on this issue...it represents a clear consensus of the majority of Americans. Then the questions is, ""why do we allow cop-killer bullets, large remove able magazines and military style weapons?"" The why is related to the fear...seeing the black polic chief of one of the best polic forces in tears should say it all...but the killing of children didn't, the murder of police won't either.  We are governed by fear...that Obama is not one of us and he's coming for your guns seems to be a thread. So is this fear of a war going to start a war? Only if we continue to let a few rather strange leaders set the agenda."
"Yes but they always had married priests and still it took many hundreds of years to get women equally ordained to priesthood.  

Many of these married men to not support women being ordained priests and if they wanted to help women genuinely then they would refuse ordination to priesthood until women were being ordained as a matter of Human and Christian Justice.  

If black men were not being ordained priests, and ordaining women could worsen or cause any delay in these men being ordained, then I would indeed be a sinner for supporting women being ordained when black men were not. 

Why is it Catholics only care about extreme injustice when it is being done to men?  Optional Celibacy is Gender Segregation with all men having all voice and control and women, including all the ordained women deacons, having no voice.  Deacons have NO Authority at all.  It is time the laity demanded we treat women like human beings."
"i have lived in Colorado for 31 yrs.,, Never start a climb after 10 am.  reasons why? Lightning, and rain, darkness.

"""Some black students are uncomfortable entering the building"".
 
How many black students feel that way? 
How many were told by the liberal administration: ""You Should feel uncomfortable here""? 
How many that were told that were already aware of Deady's history?

It would be an extremely interesting poll.

""As part of the initial demand to rename the University of Oregon’s Deady Hall...""
WHO made this ""demand""? The handful of Black students? or the Administration? Or the local NAACP? ...and why was this never before an issue?"
"Would be nice if all these coverings were in beautiful colors.

"""...all three religions have traversed periods of extremism, such as the Spanish Inquisition (Christianity) and, more recently, the fanatic Jewish settlers in Israel’s Occupied Territories whose religious claims to the land eschew the rights of others."" That seems a little harsh on the Jews of Israel. Are you seriously comparing a virtual genocide in Spain to fighting terrorism in Israel? Jews in Israel who commit crimes face a court. The Inquisition was the court. The population of Muslims in Israel has steadily increased. The population of Jews in Spain was wiped out with the exception of the conversos. Israeli Arabs, Muslim or Christian, are free to hold jobs, buy land, vote, go to court all the rights of a Jewish Israeli or any other Israeli citizen. Jews are not permitted to walk or drive in some Arab cities of the ""West Bank"". They are not permitted to buy land in Hebron. Whose rights are eschewed? I don't think it's the ""fanatic Jewish settlers""."
"Will the same standards be held to media outlets like the Toronto Star which at times legitimized some of the violence and property damage done by the Black Bloc at the Toronto G20 trying to claim it was undercover police acting as agent provocateurs infiltrating and starting the violence.?

Yes they did infiltrate these radicalized left wing groups in an attempt to break down their plans for outright chaos but they certainly did not instigate any of the violence and property damage yet the police was portrayed as the bad guys in all this.

Peaceful M103 protestors were attacked in Quebec by violent left wing supporters of M103 yet our media has a massive degree of tolerance and even support for this type of thuggery. I don't even think anyone was even charged when outright assaults on peaceful protestors took place.

Why the double standard? Does the media realize their double standard is giving rise to people's frustration and why it gave rise to people like Trump"
"A direct quote from Colin Kaepernick, who started all this: ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.""  Any player who mimics his protest is subscribing to his rationale.  My question to each member of the Broncos organization: do you have pride in this country, or do you consider it oppressive?  If the former, then stand up and respect the flag, and if you refused to do so previously, apologize for having endorsed Kaepernick's message, whether intentionally or unwittingly.  If the latter, then come right out and say it, and quit being hypocrites, claiming to support those who defend this country.  The fans deserve to know where you stand, so they can decide if they want to contribute to your egregious salaries."

We want federal pot laws enforced. People like Havelock want criminals handled with kid gloves--sending the message to criminals that crime does pay and it's well worth the risk if one knows ahead of time they'll get a slap on the wrist. Where was Havelock's outrage when Hillary Clinton wasn't taken before a grand jury over destroying her emails ? Where's was Havelock's outrage over the last AG meeting for half an hour at an airport while Bill was under investigation ?

"Important to clarify that it was ""Canadian banks"" that did not cut their dividends.  In other countries, not only did the banks eliminate their dividends, but the equity values cratered by almost 90% (for those that did NOT go bankrupt).

To say that Canadian banks will ALWAYS pay a dividend is complete hogwash.  If Canada ends up having a housing crisis, or energy crisis or other financial black swan event, Canadian banks could very well be in a situation where they are forced to cut dividends (just like what happened in the US, Europe and Japan).

If someone is losing sleep over the potential of a black swan event, then there's nothing wrong with allocating a portion of one's portfolio to cash/high interest savings.

A wise person once observed that the only things that are certain in life are death and taxes."
"I have seen and read more hateful spite by the Trumpeters taunting with the low energy/ low brow repetitions ( like they used to mantracry their fear of a Black President or about Begich being the deciding vote) of catchphrases. And the self deception of swallowing campaign rhetoric - One would surmise these folks have no critical thinking skills at all the way some bloviate empty praises, gushing blind faith that now milk & honey will flow just for them and the dissenters will be rounded up and sequestered away in gulags."
"No, what it means is that Clinton abandoned the typical Democrat base - thinking, wrongly, that women and blacks and latinos would flood the polling places and she wouldn't need her base.  

And that base DID feel abandoned.  Even Bill tried to tell her - but she moved so far left to please those on the fringe, they felt no compunction in leaving her behind.   It was not a racial vote - except perhaps on her part.  It was an economic vote and worry about making ends meet....something she refused to admit."

"In response to one of the comments here, accusing the person who wrote this blurb of trying to ruin the business discussed here is nearly as hilarious as the suggestion that they are angling for a coveted prize in journalism which would be and an unlikely event indeed should such a thing come to pass. Although the juxataposition of ""historically black "" and ""gentrification"" in the same sentence is unintentionally hilarious.  Basically the coffee/etc purveyor did not want to be associated with British Colonialism. I cannot imagine why they would not want to brand themselves with something that managed to ruin several civilizations and created conflict that continues to this day.  The outrage is curious considering some of the horribly racist and anti human things people do support whether unknowingly or just due to stupidity and ignorance"
"Eugene, one question I haven't seen asked yet is, ""Given the history of blackface in America, how  would a typical  African-American student or faculty person  have felt walking in to that party and seeing the lady in blackface? "" 
Do we think he or she   1)  would  have chuckled and said something like 'oh that's a good one, reminds of of those old Minstrel Shows"", 
Or,
2)  would  have had a sick feeling  in the pit of their stomach and said 'hey lets'  get out of here.""

Not being a black person myself it's not my responsibility to judge, but I'd say the answer to this question would suggest what the appropriate punishment for this professor might be."
"He actually has several hotels overseas, including some in the middle east.   You don't mean 'conspiracy theory' sexist 'you have to vote for me because I am a woman' Hillary do you?  Also,  it is the left that has race on the brain.   I for one do not oppose Obama because of his skin color.  I would have happily voted for Ben Carson if he had lasted.  Also, another candidate I would have voted for was Carly Fiona.   So let us not say I'm sexist.  As far as Trump's competency is concerned, he had to have some to get the hotels built.

I hardly have space here to list all the obvious evidence, such as the higher black population in California and  Washington, but you can find them in any good Oregon history book.  I urge you to go find and read them.  

Frankly I'd never heard a serious argument AGAINST this view of  the  Exclusion  law until recently when some of Deady's powerful legal friends  rushed in to Pooh Pooh its demographic effects.

"That's right!  It was all about politics as far as Pope Leo X was concerned.  Unfortunately, after the Reformation---there was a very bleak aftermath all over Europe.  The seventeenth century started off with Christians fighting each other to establish their respective beliefs as superior to each other.  It was not only Catholics and Protestants fighting each other, but also Protestants fighting each other as well.  By the time that the eighteenth century began---many educated Europeans didn't want anything to do with Christianity in ANY form.

"As with most discussions of this issue of bending the knee, this article obscures the reason why Colin Kaepernick bent the knee in the first place. The US is undergoing an epidemic of police violence against African Americans in particular, but by no means limited to them. The fact is, every African American male, rich or poor, is vulnerable to being pulled over by police for the most trivial reasons and then quite possibly being shot to death. When that issue is resolved it will be appropriate to talk about what type of protest is acceptable, but not before."

"This is a complex issue with bits of truth on many sides.  In light of Edwin Coleman's findings, the assertion that black students feel ""unsafe"" in the building, if true, suggests a serious educational flaw exacerbated by today's negative emphasis on wrongs rather than rights (as if victimized groups don't have enough ""real"" issues to worry about).  Ironically, universities (with a few glaring exceptions - see Donald Trump's perversion) are supposedly established to discover and broadcast truth.  From that perspective, it would seem that keeping Deady's name on the hall could provide a valuable spring board for demonstrating how racism can be transformed into tolerance and positive social action - which is just what Deady appears to have done in his lifetime.  If delivered, that lesson could go far toward alleviating black student's concerns about entering the place and help to constructively recast campus dialogues for improving inter-group relations."
"It's a good thing that Dr. Ben Carson, the new HUD Cabinet Secretary-designee, didn't accept your hate and belief that no black can ever be equal in our society.  

He would never have left Detroit and his two brothers and his mother in the inner city and become a pediatric neurologist.  He wouldn't now be worth $20 million.  He would never have been the Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Maryland from 1984 until his retirement in 2013.  He would never have pioneered pediatric neurosurgery there.  President Obama would never have presented him with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.

He wouldn't have written those eight  books on self-help and goal-setting and such that helped earn him that net worth.  

Instead, he would be stuck in Detroit with the other brothers doing what those who believe your hate do.  You know, the sort of things those four in Chicago did last week.  Or he would be dead.  Those were his other two options he chose not to follow."

Fact is, the Leafs simply aren't interested in doing what's required to field a winning team. They sell out every game. There's no incentive for them to actually perform well.

It looks like the Blue Jays have taken a page from the Leafs book, too, allowing at least part of the core of their team to jump ship in free agency. Why? Because fans will cram the SkyDome anyway (I adamantly refuse to call the stadium by its current corporate name).

But a Blue Jays discussion is for another time..."
"""Yet some wonky bakery owners don't want to bake a cake for 2 gay guys and this ends up with SCOTUS?""

Its ending up at the SCOTUS because, if you hadn't noticed, cases like this have been popping up all over the country - specifically surrounding businesses denying services to gay couples.  Can you name me another point in recent time when a specific group of people were being denied a service based on some inherent trait associated with them?  Obviously, blacks had a lot more issues surrounding rights and being treated equally than gays are now - but even allowing a little discrimination can open the floodgates to allowing all sorts of other things to discriminate against.

The President has a lot of power if he has the brain to use his power correctly.
The SCOTUS has a lot of power which depends heavily on who the sitting justices are at any given time.
Congress has a lot of power also, which again depends heavily on who has more seats.

There is a problem and THEY need to address it within.
I would agree Asian immigrants lower crime rates. But a look at who are murder victims and those convicted of murder and shootings in Toronto or Ottawa show a massive disproportion are first or second generation Caribbean and African immigrants. Only First Nation people have a higher murder and violent crime rate.
"I've been protesting our foreign policy since Nixon was in office, and that includes Obama's reign. The Demonrats and Rethuglicans are just left & right wings of the corporate War Party. DemLBJ's lies about the Tonkin Gulf began the huge buildup in Vietnam that led to the slaughter of 58,785 American troops and an estimated two MILLION SE Asians. It was a racist war, fought disproportionately by black inductees against yellow people who'd done us no harm. Ho Chi Minh was an open admirer of Thomas Jefferson, and Truman had promised self-determination for all people... except when they chose the wrong form of economy, and he decided France needed Vietnam's resources to rebuild after WW2. We decided Chile had made the wrong choice too, when it freely elected a socialist gov't, so we paid their military to assassinate Allende and set up a brutal dictatorship, as we had done elsewhere, e.g. Iran & Guatemala. The US is built on slavery and genocide, and eventually we'll reap what we've sown."

It was the Democratic Party who pushed for Jim Crow laws after reconstruction and who started the second KKK.  It was the Democratic Party who started the third KKK.

1964, Current Civil Rights Act passed and signed by Lyndon Johnson with 80% republican support and 68% democrat support.

1973, The democratic party adopts Margaret Sangers Eugenics program which was partially titled ""Negro Population Control"". Ms Sanger is the founder of Planned Parenthood.
Since that time, there have been very few republicans switching to the democratic party but much more democrats switching to the republican party for economic reasons, not race issues as your side believes.
Restricting voting to legal American citizens has done nothing at all to restrict the ability to vote for anyone.
If you want to find racism, which party always identifies race and which party does not. The republicans do not identify race so which is racist? Kind of logical which party uses race"
"Rowat

My tag means the Tiger of India :)

People clamour to come to Europe and North America for economic reasons. The same reason that millions clamour to move to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, etc. It isn't because of their political system.

Millions emigrate to countries like India, Malaysia, Thailand, South Africa, etc. That is the immigration you don't hear about. News about India will reinforce cliches about caste, without ever educating Canadians about other facts. News about China will reinforce cliches about the Communist Party. News from Africa will reinforce cliches about tribal warfare. ANd so on.

As for eliminating racism, perhaps the west is a leader. But it also created the problem in  the modern world. After all, do we give Germany extra points for trying to eliminate anti-semitism, or is that the least they can do?"
"Good question. Let me get on the big black party line and ask. 

""Sarah, get me all black people in North Carolina on the party line please.""

Probably something to do with how all of black Americans are on welfare and are paid to vote  for Democrats, right? Except for North Carolina, for some reason because the welfare system missed a couple of ""vote Democratic"" welfare payments in that state so NC blacks retaliated. Is that what you're looking for?

You guys are your own worst enemy. People vote AGAINST your party because of your party's obvious racism. The only people surprised to hear people think Republicans are racist are people who defend the Republican party by making racist statements."
"That is ""don't fear people who claim to follow a religion with frightening doctrines but, in fact, really don't believe."" I agree. But fundamentalist Christians openly condemn homosexuality on very good scriptural authority. Nothing to worry about? Well, some like to call it hate speech. The Pew Research Centre survey of American Muslims found that 59% believe that following the Quran and Sunnah is essential to their identity as Muslims. So that includes the punishment of stoning  adulteresses, and don't even think about fornication! Although the Islamic Supreme Council of America helpfully points out that the standard of proof for an accusation is so high that it's hard to get a conviction. Africa contains 1.25 billion people. In Pew's survey of countries with Muslims, most wanted Sharia as the law of the land (1 country @ 35%, 2 @ 47%, the rest 50% + up to 86% in Niger). As a convinced secularist, I think that I should be wary of irrational, absolutist beliefs and the believers."

In particular young males are asked to exercise extreme caution in affected cities in their interactions with the police. Do not be confrontational and cooperate.”"

  ""After graduating from Washington High School in Portland in 1914, Mabel Byrd made history as the first African American enrolled at the University of Oregon. Byrd matriculated at UO in 1917 as a student majoring in economics, and spent two years on the campus prior to transferring to the University of Washington in 1919.

While at the University of Oregon, Byrd was the only black resident of Eugene. Because school and state policy prohibited her from living in the campus dormitories because of her race, Byrd lived in the home of history professor Joseph Schafer. There she worked as a domestic for the Schafer family while attending the university."" [UO Untold Stories]"
"The only way to eliminate black-market marijuana is to remove the profit... the only incentive.  To do this the price of the legal stuff has to be low enough to accomplish that.
Fact is... legal marijuana will likely be highly taxed and priced high, allowing the black market to remain in business, and perhaps even thrive.
The same thing is currently happening with cigarettes... a thriving black market that outsells legal product.
The ability to ""grow your own"" might have an impact on black-market distribution however."

Her first was in 2003 and there were only 2 places in the country that even trained seizure alert dogs at that time. Her first dog died in 2013 and we were able to get another in 2014. It usually takes at least 2 years to train these dogs before they can even be placed and I have to tell you, both of the dogs have been absolutely amazing. The first was a black lab and the one we have now is a golden lab. 

Do your research on these places who claim they train service dogs and ask for references. These dogs are not cheap, usually they will run around 20K (we got her first dog thru Make A Wish and the 2nd thru fundraising) and if trained correctly, worth every penny."

"You have info that GG ""illegal immigrant' members have tried to cross the border?  Which parent in their right mind would attempt/allow such an international border cross?  Your response obfuscates vis-a-vis  CC's points.  Yes, Cdn citizens/residents are refused entry for various reasons, likewise Americans at Cdn borders.  The FACT is rejection rates have risen and what is different is increased interrogations, fingerprinting, photographing, detention, inexplicable, unreasonable, reasons for rejections (e.g., 62 yr old Bill McLevin); the deliberate singling out of brown people whether they are Cdn born (telling one such brown woman she needed a visa) or not; questioning Muslim individuals about their religion and opinions about 45.  Maybe GG is looking at the experience of the teenage hockey player who had to be left at the border b/c he wasnt allowed to cross with his team.

It clearly shows this guy wasn't given a rough ride----and in fact it appears he stood up and bounced himself around inside the back of the van.  This , in my opinion , was a simple case of a black prosecutor showboating for blacks across America--by talking tough when she had to know she had no facts to back up her charges.  The only victims in this case are the poor police who have had their reputations and lives changed forever because of the bogus charges .  I hope they all personally sue the prosecutor ."
"Is it really about systemic racism.   About systemic racism- it is more prevalent in Chicago where black on black crime is out of control. Chicago is a city run by liberals. Accessing higher education, entrepreneurial spirit, capitalism and free market principles, two parent homes and not having a child until married are the best ways to fight systemic racism. Sybil Jordan Hampton overcame systemic racism in Little Rock, Ar, by persevering while attending Central High, the high school forced to integrate in 1957.  Jordan earned a bachelor’s degree from Earlham College in Indiana, a master’s degree in elementary education at the University of Chicago, and a master’s and doctorate from the Teachers College, Columbia University in New York City. No one spoke to her during her three years at Central High and she was spat upon and kicked. but she went on to receive numerous awards and honors. She was named to Arkansas Business’s Top 100 Women in Arkansas.  That's how you overcome racism."
"NFL's biggest illusions are a workplace free from racial discrimination and bigotry. Scores of African-American players show the ""Black Power"" salute to reflect their absolute intolerance of anyone else. These blatant EEO violations are yet more reasons why NFL customers are fleeing in record numbers.

As do the Bungles, the Browns, the Raiduhs, the Dolphins, etc. Funny how the DP refused to discuss the Broncos attendance at the last game? Kiz and crew can't handle the truth that their livelihoods are in jeopardy by the NFL cabal. 

Great illusion by the NFL to advance Cam Newton as their poster or poser guy? Newton loves to show the ""Black Power"" salute to reflect his abject intolerance of anyone not African-American. Newton's misogyny is just the tip of an enormous iceberg. Maybe bring back Darren Sharper?"

An appeal to emotion which has no place in a rational discussion involving the exercise of what may be a political right (yet to be determined by a Court) and multiple economic and political realities.

Since the practical and economic issue at hand has to do with residence, not race; that one side of the issue is relying on emotional BS while utterly ignoring the clear economic and practical problems means that no rational person should take them seriously until they come up with an intellectually serious argument."
"""If I'm reading the Pew article correctly...Nondenominational Protestants...Pentecostals... are underrepresented.""

Not really, MattinTX. Non-denominational Protestants and Pentecostals are always put under the generic label ""Protestant,"" in Congress. In Pew, Gallup and other pollsters, the ""Protestant"" label includes Evangelical, mainline, Pentecostal, and ""non-denomination"" along with any and all other non-Catholic, non-Mormon, and non-Orthodox Christian groups in between them and among them. Thus when Pew researchers say 46% of the US population identify as Protestant, for example, they put all of the above self-identified, highly diversified groups (in Congress, too) -- Evangelical, mainline, primitive Baptist, Southern Baptist, Black Baptist, Pentecostal, neo-Pentecostal, non-denominational Christian, etc. and hundreds more -- under the label ""Protestant."" Catholics, Mormons, Jews, NONES (more than 24%), Buddhists, Orthodox, Muslims, etc., make up the other 56% of the population"

Then there was the despicable damage done to James Field's beautiful car by Heather Heyer's body and the bodies of 19 other vicious counter-protesters as he mowed them down in it.

And of course there is the impending dismantling of Robert E Lee's gorgeous metallic horsey-riding likeness, ending it's all too brief 93 year run of intimidating the black citizens of Charlottesville and celebrating Lee's unsuccessful attempt to destroy America and perpetuate slavery with a war that killed close to 1 million people.

We must stop these liberals from abusing our lawns with their feet as they flee gun violence, wrecking our cars with their bodies as we run them over and destroying our horsey-riding statues to our enemies' slavery-championing war heros!"
"However, one elderly NAACP leader had something to say about this that sparked a lot of attention:

“I think it’s all senseless. All senseless,” Esther Lee, president of the Bethlehem, Pennsylvania chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People said Tuesday, WFMZ reported.

Lee is appalled at the left for trying to destroy, vandalize, and remove the Confederate and historical monuments from the face of the nation.

“You know that’s history. That was at that point in time. You can’t eliminate what history is. So I disapprove with young people pulling down those statues,” she said.


NBA legend Charles Barkley “I’m not going to waste my time worrying about these Confederate statues — that’s wasted energy,” he said. “You know what I’m gonna do? I’m gonna keep doing great things, I’m gonna keep trying to make a difference — number one, in the black community because I’m black — but I’m also going to try to do good things in the world.”"
"Wrong.  It is when you can see pavement through the ice on the road, hence the term black ice.  Wikipedia is your friend."
"My, my! It is shameful that Boyden's biggest defenders in this discussion are Sun Media (which has compared this to the birther conspiracy) and people who say racist things like ""You are so deluded by clinging to your ancestry.""

Boyden has claimed numerous variations on indigenous ancestry, but he's never been specific. He's hinted that his Uncle Erl really was indigenous, but how was that? His defenders have suggested it's hard to trace one's ancestors, but we don't know if that's true of Boyden's family tree. He's not telling.

And did he get his gig in New Orleans by saying he had Nipmuc blood and therefore didn't need a Green Card? One wonders. Playing Indian is a common theme in American lit. There are lots of examples. It sure ain't easy to pretend to be Black to get ahead. Unless you're Mindy Kaling's brother."
"Good article. I suspect the author was in the wrong field. As a black woman in a similar environment, I encounter the same issues but my passion for my job gives me armour. If you love what you do, you are less affected by the negatives that come in many and varied forms. The firms could have a better mentorship program but I am encouraged that although slow, what is 'normal' changing and diversity will be better supported. Secondly, building relationships with people forces them to see you and vice versa. Not everyone will want to be your friend and sometimes, colour has little to do with it. Build your network to sustain you in and out of work and build a life that makes you happy."
"One day some years ago, my 4 year old son and I were taking an elevator ride at the shopping center. The elevator stopped, the doors opened and in came someone clad in black and face covered with a niqab. My son was startled, grabbed me by my pants and started screamin! That was enough for me. It took me and my wife a week to reassure our boy that the person in black will not come after him and that he is safe."
"""Kimball, an FBI informant-turned-serial-killer, is serving a 70-year sentence for four murders committed after he was released from federal prison in December 2002 to act as an FBI informant.""

Another FBI success story handling informants, right up there with Whitey Bulger. 

You really have to wonder about the FBI given their recent history. They knew about and interviewed the Boston Bombers, Orlando, San Bernadino Islamic Terrorists before their attacks.

They definitely need to do some work on their interviewing skills."
"Phyllis, you are fortunate that your new calendar is mostly empty. Many of us find that ours are already ""prefilled"" and with a black marker too.

Not sure of your colour chart for the seven deadly sins though. I do not see colors as sinful. But then again I have been told I am a little colour blind!!

Not to worry, but blessings on your 2017 as well. Let it be as colourful as a rainbow."
"It’s just a weird series of coincidences based on his not knowing any better that he hired a bunch of Nazis to his staff, won’t distance himself from the Klan, hired Kobach and Hans von Spakovsky and Jeff Sessions and his only governing principle is overturning everything President Black Man did.
Really, it’s sad because he just means well and is in over his head."
Latin America does have its problem with Africa.
"Black Liberalism Collective, LOL. What are they trying to liberate from themselves? The positive discrimination, the government handouts, that everyone walks on eggshells around them and caters to them?"
"I know who he is, I wanted to know upon what authority he bases his opinions. I'm not going to be buying his book but if he is saying that the Church can dissolve a valid sacramental marriage then he is mistaken. That is all I'm concerned with.
My initial complaint was that you do not support your opinions with arguments. Telling me to read the Gospels to find the answers to the dubia is like telling me to look for a needle in a haystack. Now to support your opinions you refer me to an American Federal judge and tell me to read his book.
An annulment for whatever reason it has been granted, in good faith or otherwise, cannot dissolve a valid, sacramental marriage."
"Jade: Mr. Kaepernick and the other players around the NFL are now ""taking a knee"" during the Anthem.  It is a ""personal"" act, but as with almost all protests is done in a public forum to bring attention to the ""cause"" involved.  His protest has been quite effective and the protest has garnered increasing support from other players.  Additionally, his actions have encouraged a wider discussion of both the ""cause""....the treatment of blacks in our society, especially the treatment by police; and, as a byproduct, the discussion of Freedom of Expression guaranteed by our Constitution.  Both discussions are important.

The threatened violence against Mr. Kaepernick and his family represent, IMO, a far greater threat to the values I cherish than does his protest.  I'd be interested to read the counter-argument if anyone would care to present it.   regards, Gary"
"What do you have in mind to fix this ""loophole"". In my opinion, there is no way in my lifetime we would be able to get guns off the black market. It's a huge money making system. More laws restricting ownership only increases unregistered weapons. I really have no idea either so I'll just stop here."
"Gary, your comments echo those of HUD Secretary Ben Carson as quoted in a vary recent column by Jason L. Riley in the Wall Street Journal. Too bad the R-G does not reprint columns by serious conservatives, especially black ones like Riley. Carson takes it one step farther by stressing that we need to find ways to help the people you mention who are capable of it to help themselves. He wants to make HUD an agency focused on enhancing human capital. There is plenty of common ground between liberals like you and conservatives like me and Ben Carson, a guy selected for his position by Donald Trump, of course. Too bad that seems to be enough reason for some to dismiss Carson."
"Americans seem to be paralyzed by fuzzy concepts of ""intergenerational guilt."" I have no responsibility for any acts committed by others, especially for acts committed by past generations. Agonizing over past real or perceived injustices done to American Indians, Negroes, etc. is wasted emotion which serves primarily to confuse people & divert attention from valid current issues."
"I will vote for Grant, as well as persons of color in other positions, such as Preeti Shridhar for Port Commisioner Position 4. Grant and Mosqueda are both well-qualified, but Grant aligns more closely with my beliefs. I would not vote based on color or gender; it's pandering and just the kind of thing that tRumpkins mock. 
My favorite politician (believe it or not, there are some good ones) is the fantastic Pramila Jayapal. I don't love her because she's a woman or a person of color, I love her for her courage and her progressive stance. I'm happy she represents me in Congress. 
And for Port of Seattle Position 1, I am a firm supporter of Ryan Calkins, who opposed the ""Shelling"" of the Port. I don't care what color he is - I don't know what he looks like. I am also proud to support Pat Murakami for City Council. I don't support her because she's a woman. I support her because she gives a damn about neighborhoods, not developers."
"What an offensive column.  For starters, this is not a television show.  

The people of Saint-Apollinaire have stated they do not want a cemetery in the backyards.  They don't want a Catholic cemetery, a Jewish cemetery, a Chinese cemetery, or a Muslim cemetery.  To immediately think it's got something to do with antipathy toward brown-skinned people is completely off-base.  

Is there not another suitable piece of land in the entire Province of Quebec where the Muslims can have their cemetery without having to play the racial and religious discrimination card?  

The path to a conflict-free cemetery is there - no need to make a Federal case out of it."
"Yes, the case has been referred.  Strongly agree that boat driver's religious affiliation should be legally irrelevant. Thought authorities were investigating a possible crime, not an accident. 

 Religious affiliation and relationship to a U.S. Congresswoman become relevant to voters and constituents, however, especially if the Congresswoman is a self identified Hindu, her version of which is cult like.  

Sounds like this small religious community is hiding behind mainstream Hinduism.  Agree that Hinduphobia, has no place in Hawaii.  Neither does islamophobia."
"Marrus is a fine fellow, a respected scholar and a distinguished citizen.  But put yourself in the black junior fellow's shoes. A powerful privileged Canadian has just belittled you and called you a slave. Funny? Or have you just been squished, put in your place? Shamed?  This is how we need to look at power imbalance and racist humour. Not to defend the perpetrator but to advocate for the human being on the painful receiving end of the ""joke""."

""Sen. Tim Scott, the only Black Republican senator, reminds America everyday that our party stands on the side of providing a hand-up to all, especially people of color. Scott’s “Opportunity Agenda” is proof of his commitment as a Republican to providing for those often overlooked. ""

"I see that you now recognize that it is not a right.  It is too bad this epaper struggles with interpretation of prejudice. And the worst comments about Black do not come from Black which is the point.

"Another whine from Charles.  You should be grateful that you live in a country that gives you the opportunity to be successful and happy like Barack Obama and Eric Holder and Michael Jordan.  Were it not for black privilege and affirmative action, Obama would never be president.

How much reparations do you feel ENTITLED to Charles?  Give us a number that would make you happy."
"So, you want to consider aspects of character?  Two of the judges were appointed by Democrat presidents.  The only one appointed by a Republican is Judge Callahan, approved by every Democrat senator.  A profile last year in The Daily Journal explained:
""A hoofer with a sense of humor, Callahan likes to surprise judicial and legal gatherings by starting discussions about serious topics and ending with a quip about appellate judges who tap dance around issues. She then pulls off her black robe to reveal a sequined costume and tap shoes.
She's been known to hop on a tabletop or in one case on a judicial bench during these special events and do some pretty impressive steps. ""I may be the highest ranking tap dancer in federal court,"" Callahan said with a grin during a recent interview in her chambers in the Sacramento federal court building. ""It is fun and it has a certain shock value.""""

"The situation of the black students in California is not grounded in threats and not even objectively reasonable grounds to believe they are being threatened.  It's grounded in speech, pictures and actions motivated by bigotry and racial hatred.  The problem is that those speech, pictures and actions create a toxic atmosphere.  Nobody deserves to work or go to school under such conditions.  Living surrounded by hatred and contempt is not theoretical, it's real and it's bad.  

Your argument sets up a straw man of feelings of fear neither reasonable nor based in bigotry/racism/misogyny.  Of course there will never be a cause of action, or grounds for a complaint based on the fear of little people cowed by the mere presence of big people.

Up to you of course, but I wish you'd reconsider writing such things as ""nobody has a right ""not to feel"" anything.""  It only feeds anti-human rights bigots."
"Actually, there were plenty of riots and looting after Obama won.  Each time. Only a very few made the news, though... the vivid ones of people hanging straw-stuffed dummies (colored black, with ""Obama"" written on them) from trees and lighting them on fire come to mind.  I'm sure if I took a minute to research, I could find more.  But to say that ""we"" are different an accepted an outcome ""we"" didn't like, while ""you"" are out rioting and looting, is simply false."

This is not Canada ...with a bunch of « Loyalists » Orangemen.  
There is no place for a bunch of Ku-Ku-Klowns in Canada.
After the establishment of the Canadian Federation (1867), the English speaking several provinces attended helplessly to the adoption of several LAWS and regulations, anti-Catholic and anti-French in English Canada, especially in that regard to denominational schools outside Québec.
Anti-Catholic and anti-French attitude drew its source, among others, the fact that many of the Loyalists who came to Québec after the American Revolution of 1775 (Eastern Townships/ Ontario and Western Provinces) were ""Orangemen"" convinced.  Orangemen advocated an anti-Catholic and anti-French doctrine, inspired by the reconquest of England in 1690 by the Protestant Prince William III of Orange.…
	
And Paf ! Problems started across French Canada ever since !"
"it is absolutely disrespectful to the flag and what it stands for to kneel during the anthem. The protesting athletes might want to open a history book at take a look at the flag that flew over the Union soldiers during the Civil war, and the flag that liberated the world from tyranny in WW1 and WW2; because if Hitler had won, there would be no blacks left on this planet, or Jews or Gypsies, or gays. America isn't perfect, but it is a hell of a lot better than most places in the world today for freedom of expression, freedom to live, love and worship as you want. 

Now, if you athletes want to make a difference, protest the violence and poverty in the inner cities, protest the destruction of the Black family, protest the culture that demeans learning and hard work to get ahead in the world. Protest the culture of 'victimhood'."
"Well, when you have an unreliable pen whose 6th and 7th inning guys seem to get one or two outs and then blow up, I do not think taking a chance was a terrible idea.  I do think Black left him in too long--maybe to prove a point?

The Rockies desperately needed someone to shore up the bullpen and we got a catcher whose offense is not as good as the current guys on the roster?  Yeah, he is experienced, but we seem to have a huge hole in the bullpen which needed fixing more than the catcher position."
"The reason why feelings alone CANNOT  be the basis for official action is simple. I am not responsible for your paranoia. 
Note that I am not suggesting that black fellow students of the poster in California are paranoid; they have objectively reasonable grounds to believe they are being threatened. However there are people, most notably American policemen,  who will feel threatened without reasonable grounds; their feelings are not and cannot be my responsibility, so a right not to feel threatened is meaningless.
This is not merely hypothetical, it's personal. I am quite pacifist by nature but I am very large; 195 cm., 150 kg. There are people who feel threatened by my simple presence in their vicinity. Do you believe that I violate those people's rights simply by being out in public.?"
"As I posted previously, I don't know about a flag. What I do know is that a little less than a year ago, my boys' team played Weld Central, and after the game they told me (without being prompted) that the Weld team had used racial slurs against our black players throughout the game. I confirmed this with some of the other players. They told me this last year--not in response to the story this weekend. Dismiss our experience if you want, but it leads me to believe that the allegations of slurs being used on the field could likely be true."

Do your homework next time"
"Maralyn Kurshals  I wasn't a great fan of Trump, but he is now POTUS and we must come together to fix our economic, social, and political problems.  Your comments about PP, Meals on Wheels, and other stuff are just Democrat/Left talking points.  However, Trump's ""moral conscience"" is exactly what prompted the retaliation for Assad's use of chemical weapons to kill men, women, and children in his own country.  In fact, Trump simply enforced the red line drawn by Obama which Obama was too weak to enforce.   Perhaps this explains why you last paragraph shifted to comment on former President Obama.  Surely you know by now that it is not political correct to attack our first half-Black American president.   Thankfully, that era will not only pass; it has already passed."
"""people of colour and marginalized communities cannot be racist. By definition.""

Clearly not true.

People of colour coming from one particular community are too often racist/bigoted towards people of colour coming from another.  Think of all the conflict in Africa and Asia, then think of those communities existing in Canada.  It's a sad truth that no group of people is free from racism and bigotry."
"Mr. Atkinson, I agree with your reply. Indeed, all changes for the better. However, the state has poured vast amounts of money into worthless projects like Port Mackenzie, the Anchorage fish processing plant , KABATA, the black hole port of Anchorage and more while making piecemeal improvements to the Seward Highway.  Half the population of Alaska drives on that dangerous outdated highway. A death today, two deaths a month later, another three months later. Individually they do not garner attention. Cumulatively it is outrageous yet tolerated by our citizens and politicians alike. It is not a traffic enforcement problem. The Autobahn in Germany allows three times the posted speed of the Seward Highway without the carnage.  Fundamentally, the problem is the Seward Highway is a two lane country road, with gawking tourists and people anxious to get to Seward and the Kenai. The highway operates at over capacity with an assortment of heavy, slow and fast vehicles of all shapes and sizes."
"What's the rush on this?  

Legalizing doesn't cut out the black market.  They just offer newer/different strains, higher potency or mix it with other drugs.

Cannabis legalization results in increased traffic deaths from driving while under the influence.  We don't even have a reliable method to do a roadside test yet!!

Could it be that the government is trading our health/safety for a tax grab?"
"This guy did not kill himself out of guilt, more like he wanted an out for the relentless beatings and pumpings that he would have to endure every day for the rest of his life.  All the roids' in the world are not going to protect him in prison.  The men Hernandez murdered has gang friends in prison including many in black gangs who wanted revenge and his fame in the NFL only magnifies that hate in prison.  They wanted Hernandez alive so he could experience hell and if they were going to take out Hernandez in prison, like Jeffrey Dahmer
they would not stage a fake suicide, rather it would be a vicious shiv attack or beating which the attackers could take credit and gain a positive prison rap from their fellow inmates.  The guy who took out Dahmer in prison is a hero to many, including many American citizens, the murdered victims families and the prison guards and warden who many felt execution was the only real solution for Dahmer."

I had to ""vote"" yes or no on piano2's response to SpenAk. I considered it to be civil and the next thing that happened was I got the ""black page warning"" for agreeing it was civil. So I guess the use of words such as ""snide, ""sarcastic"" and ""disrespectful""  are uncivil. Civil should come up to Alaska and learn what words here are really ""uncivil""."

"Thirty years ago? Is there a police report on file? Was this reported to the airline and the authorities? Beside we've be told all this harassment of women is a private matter, between a husband and wife. Twenty years ago, women were bimbos, and it was said, that all a man had to do was walk though a trailer park with a dollar bill. What about all the CLAIMS, women made of Bill Clinton, at the time, not thirty years later? What's changed? Harvey Weinstein's behavior over thirty years, interesting. A rich powerful man, noted Democrat, noted donor to Democrat candidates. And what's groping? Is is like racism, any criticism of a selective blacks is now racism. If a women backs into a the hand of a rich power man and the hand touch her rear, is that now groping? Or if the rich power man touches period, it that now groping? Words have meanings and the left hijacked the meaning to promote their cause."
"The author is clearly extremely intelligent and accomplished, and you'd have to walk in her shoes to know her true experiences.  On the other hand, as someone who is embedded in the Bay St firm culture, I have to say I do not fully accept that women of colour are not well accepted.  Succeeding in that environment is like climbed a greased pole.  Everyone finds it challenging and attrition rates are high.  My experience suggests you actually CAN be yourself, and if you're a good lawyer, provide great legal advice and generate client work you can succeed.  The towers at King and Bay aren't made of ivory and aren't full of entitled blue bloods.

"Hamish,
About 30 years ago I was going on a trip and I asked all of my kids what they wanted me to bring back for them. One of my teenage foster daughters asked for a tarantula. This young lady had gone through very traumatic events in her life. She dressed in leather with spikes and had one half of her head shaved and the other half dyed purple. If she ""looked"" tough people would leave her alone. 
I managed to catch a tarantula while in N.M. and bought a little cage to carry it in. I covered the cage with a cloth. On the first two legs of my return trip, I had no problem. I told security (before TSA) what it was and then showed them. 
But, in LA, I was ""carried"" out of the security area by two huge security guards. The airline told me NO FLIGHT with the spider. I got my dander up and ended being kicked off the flight. I finally found a sympathetic airline who suggested I put it in my backpack and let a different security crew know ahead of time. Made it home a day later with it 🕷."

Maybe Denver should look at who goes to jail and who shouldn't.  Reforms should always begin with the gate keepers of any jail (DPD).  Two men of color who only have a warrant for trespassing.  Transient men who have a mental illness should go where they could receive the treatment they should have.  Why would a police officer choose to exert their authority on mental transient who I am sure they know.  I am sure they wanted to fill their Dailey log sheet.  Maybe criminal justice reforms needs to begin with the officers who bring these people to a place they really don't belong in.

"The article does not mention that the majority of America';s Catholic Bishops, especially Cardinal Burke, wholeheartedly supported Trump -- Burke claimed there was only one possible Catholic choice. Our Catholic bishops sold out the African-Americans and Hispanics with full knowledge of Trump's racist statements throughout the campaign.

The bishops picked three issues -- abortion, birth control and gay marriage -- and ignored the person of Jesus, the Gospel, and  the

You have the same argument supporters of slavery used, that blacks were better off under ownership of their masters than they were running free in Africa. It's better in America, even if you're a slave and even if you're in prison. Tell us more about it."

Barack Obama was slammed by the right, and the left wondered what the fuss was about. Surely we remember the wild conspiracy theories that Obama was a Nigerian Kenyan Muslim Manchurian candidate.
Now Trump is in the spotlight.
It's been this way for at least 25 years.

"""scientists still exclude the possibility of Mind and Choice occurring at the molecular level before sentient life existed.""

That's not how science works. Describe the experiment or observation that would test this notion and then it can become a scientific issue.

Not all scientists are atheists, so it's an irrelevant ad hominem.  No one has ever proposed that it ""just happened"". The entire point of this line of research is to determine how life began. There is no assumption that it ""just happened"". 

""Do jigsaw puzzles EVER assemble themselves?""

It hasn't been observed, but in an infinite universe the odds that it happened at least once could be more favourable than you think. In any case, this is the problem of induction that all science faces. No matter how many observations you make, a black swan event is always possible. So scientists don't believe anything with 100% conviction. The just support a given explanation with varying levels of confidence."

"A dollar a gram tax, plus 10 cents a gram to cover all costs, gets a retail price of $1.10 per gram, plus whatever taxes the provinces impose. Even if all those taxes get it up to three dollars a gram, that's still quite a bit less than the black market price. 

""The governments have said it's not a cash grab."" Do you believe them?"
"Where in the New Testament are followers of Jesus told to take physical violence against anyone for any reason? Christ did command ""turn the other cheek ... go the second mile ... love your enemies,"" did He not? Why do those who are zealous for following the Bible so often ignore Bible teachings? In the end are they following Scripture or their own, sinful ideas?"
"Obama's legacy is that he was the first black US President.  Whoohoo!  Look, he got into Harvard on affirmative action, and basically became the President because of affirmative action.  It proves that the US is not a racist society, on the whole

As for policy and effectiveness, he was a total failure and leaves America more divided than at any time in the last 50 years.  On the global scene, the US is at its weakest position since the Carter years."
"How many African American writers are there at the Post, how many editors?"
"It behooves us to read a history of the Catholic Church's ministries to African Americans.  Wish I could recommend one off-hand but can't.  Having had personal experience working in the RCC with both minorities (also the American Indian), I can say it was mostly good.  The abuse & neglect must have been there too but I did not experience it personally.  I feel it's really important to be fair in our judgment of the Church while at the same time recognizing and repairing the abuses. On the other hand, it's my experience and  observation that the Church's hierarchy and priests largely stay out of the fray of race relations, working quietly behind the scenes in many good ways."
"Why are the Dutch riled up you ask ?

Despite being welcomed into Dutch society and freeloading off the  system, these immigrants instead of being grateful for a new life in the Netherlands,  complain about not being given enough welfare, feel it is their right to destroy public/private property at any perceived slight to their social, politicial or religious beliefs, and beyond this are commiting crimes, harassing and raping women, as in their backward culture and religion, women are kept behind closed doors only allowed out covered in black shrouds so as not to entice men.  Their views on human and women's rights and dress codes go back to the 7th century so forgot about them integrating into modern Dutch society.

The  Dutch PM  is now saying that he 'gets it' so that he can counter the potential vote shift towards Geert Wilders.   Too little too late.  The Dutch have tolerated years of inaction from their elected leaders and need to give them the boot before its too late."
"We are talking about commodities - things that are bought and sold, including art works and antiquities. Basic supply and demand. How could the black market be made less black? Well, obviously law enforcement plays an important role, as do international agreements  that protect archaeological sites, but my primary point is that if people didn't turn a blind eye to the origins of what they are buying, the problem would be lessened. You seem to think this is a trivial issue, but it's not. Sites have been destroyed, museums depleted (look at what happened in Baghdad in 2003, after Rumsfeld declined to station troops at various cultural sites). Museums and collectors are still returning stolen art works to Jewish families."
"A couple things, the GOP opposed Hillarycare back in the 90's so it had nothing specifically to do with Obama it had to do with the central government taking over 1/6 of the nation's GDP. This was never about opposing our new black president named Obama, it had to do with opposing government run health insurance. 
Secondly the majority in hte GOP never fully back Heritagecare and the mandate in Heritagecare was only for catastrophic insurance coverage, which was already included in the vast majority of existing insurance plans. 
Bottom line Obamacare did little of nothing in reforming actual healthcare, it's only purpose was to find ways to pay for the overcharging and waste in our healthcare system and drug prices."
"James:  Let's be a bit more careful when referring to my comments, please.  My use of the term ""zealots"" was (and is) a direct reference to those persons screaming for Ms. Shurtz's dismissal from the University (either self-imposed through resignation, or imposed by the Administration through termination). Are some of those persons African American?  Yes, they likely are.  Zealotry is ""color blind""...and, as we've seen over our history, there are zealots of every race, gender, ethnicity, nationality and religious affiliation.  There are tall zealots, short zealots, fat zealots and thin zealots.  Please don't imply that I called anyone a zealot because of his/her race.  If I call someone a zealot, it will be based on his/her statements and actions.  I don't apologize for applying it to those who support Ms Shurtz's dismissal.  I have not ""abandoned"" it......not hardly, and I don't intend to do so.  Be most happy to sit down and discuss this issue w/you anytime....call me  Gary Crum"
"Civil posts are to be left up on the board, even if you disagree with them. Black Lives Matter and anti-fa are both hate groups so why were they not called out when the burned and looted Ferguson, and killed/ incited murdering police?"
"The last resort of someone who has no argument is to declare everyone who holds an opposing opinion to be a ""racist,"" as if this obviates the need for any further consideration.  According to a recent poll, 2/3 of the citizens agree with the sentiment expressed, however crudely, by Trump.  Yet somehow this country twice elected a black man as president.  That should be enough to overcome your sadness and embarrassment with a good case of cognitive dissonance."

Remember, Lincoln was elected on a platform of permanent slavery for blacks  and the North never abolished slavery until 4 years after the started when the were clearly about to loose."
"Kag ,  I suspect there are as many causes of  a vote for Trump as there are those who voted for him .  
How to account for the woman who thanked him for making it possible for her husband to go down into the coal mines thus making it easy for him to suffer from Black Lung  Disease which , by the way is even more likely now than previously .  
People who benefit from welfare voted for him .  Where were they when  Trump promised to destroy such programs ?  
The backing of  Trump by Republican Catholic bishops astounds me ."

You don't seem to understand the difference between street crime and government sponsored murder. We know the police are happy to kill every black criminal they can. They have no interest in hunting the murders in their ranks. That is the problem.
so you're saying it's only political and against Trump and nothing to do with the way blacks are treated in America.
"""that it apologize for slavery""? ""anti-black racism ""lies at the core"" of many Canadian institutions"". What?! 

This is ridiculous. Get a sense of proportion. There are so many problems in the world, and the UN comes up with this?"
"Pot, meet Kettle. It is black."
"ok lets make it simple for you and your friends.
if it's the way blacks are treated in America the issue, why didn't they protest when Obama was president.
why all of a sudden Trump is the bogeyman and not the treatment of blacks."
"""blacks only make up 15% of the population in the US but commit over 50% of the crime""?

We get it. You don't think a black man should be able to be president.
"1. The electoral college system is plainly anti-democratic - its a system that permits election of the loser of the popular vote. That's the very definition of anti-democratic.

2. Google ""crosscheck."" Its a system set up by Republican operatives that matches last ad first names of registered voters in different states. The states then remove people from the voter rolls (in some cases without even  notifying them). So, ""John B. Washington"" in North Carolina gets removed because there is a ""John C. Washington"" in Indiana. The program disproportionately targets black people because of the commonality of some last names (i.e. inherited slave owner names).
Also, look at what, i.e., Wisconsin, Ohio, North Carolina, and various other red states have done regarding, i.e., number and distribution of polling places including number of machines at different polling places); availability of early voting, etc."
"Firstly I do not defend the old flag. There are not enough comment characters available for proper, clear debate. Secondly my problem with this article is the continued attack on anything Afrikaans by mostly libtard journalists and opinionistas. Thirdly my biggest gripe is with the apparent want by these writers to deny history and write certain segments of society who are part of this country and history from history. Fourthly their hypocrisy of pointing out the wrongs of the past but then suggesting same oppressive remedies is sickening. Such as the removal of ANY symbols of a group and their identity or attacking their language and culture CONSTANTLY. How is that any different from past attacks on the dignity and culture of black South Africans? Lastly your example of a Hitler statue in TelAviv is not the same. If you said in Berlin it would be more accurate. There are hardly any non-Jewish Germans living in Tel Aviv or Israel or having played a direct role in the history of Israel."
"You realize that the CP stands for ""Colored People"" and advocates solely for blacks. Yet the NAACP's openly racist policies are ennobling ""diversity and inclusion""?"

"WOW, 64goo knows sooooo much about black history. He must be black right?"
You fail to report the reasons for the bad condition of black neighborhoods - and it is not the fault of the other races. The lack of supermarkets is caused by the customers there - no smart business wants to deal with them.

"Charles Blow is a CNN contributor, NYT columnist, and african american with a booming voice.  He is NOT kind in his assessment of 45.  He doesnt suffer fools wisely; particularly 45 supporters and their pretzel-ing attempts at justifying everything/whatever he does; generally plays by the rules, if there are any - will let 45 defenders talk without interrupting and will not allow them to interrupt/filibuster him, which seems to key strategy in their playbook on talking heads shows.   This of course makes him persona non grata among 45ers.  Personally, he reminds me a bit of James Baldwin.  Not sure about the birds of a feather remark, maybe start with they're both black? (LOL)"
"Also, there is no sense pretending you are willing to engage in a discussion. The only time you've offered any specifics is when you're trying to deflect to Hillary.

You haven't even attempted once to defend Trump or to even acknowledge his history of anti-black segregation and his teen ogling and his stiffing of small businesses.

Instead in almost every word of your comments, you dislocate your shoulder by patting yourself on the back for how civil you are. Watching you fawn over yourself isn't actually a discussion. It's especially hypocritical when you're applauding your own civility while you defend an uncivil Twitterpated anti-black segregationist.

Racism persists because of otherwise ""civil"" ""polite"" ""respectful"" people who reward and cosign  racists acts like Trump's anti-black segregation."
It's attitudes like the letter writer that are part of the problem (note... part). What's the big deal if a cop shoots a black criminal? I would hope that everyone would be concerned if the police gun down criminal suspects (or school cafeteria workers) before the courts have a chance to decide guilt and an appropriate punishment. Thomas seems to think that black criminals don't deserve that process.
"I believe, a bad choice based on ""black quilt"" or ""we're great because we choose a black women"" or both but certainly not merit. There were many inspirational women of greater merit who courageously fought long and hard for women rights. This woman, Viola, bought a movie ticket for the balcony seats not the more expensive floor seats. She then illegally (not as a black protest)  sat in the floor seat area, was caught, and arrested. She then had to be talked into going to court. She refused to take part in the existing black activist movement. Instead she moved to the USA. She's not an inspiration. Give me two 5 dollar bills please."
"Posting a picture of a black male charged with indiscriminate shooting of a gun during a fender bender accident might be 'profiling'?

Who knows?  

When I looked him up on line, every single mugshot with his first and last name was a black person, so I'm hardly surprised.


Only the jail could tell you why his picture wasn't posted.  I saw Jasmine Martina's picture on television last night, though, so it is a mystery.


There is also a 2013 Facebook entry for someone of that name in Springfield.  That black male appears to be displaying some sort of 'sign' with his right hand.  

They both fit the definition of 'punk', however, no matter what race they might be."
"Play back all of the RNC video sessions, Gegonos, and see if you can actually count how many black faces you can find in any of the videos.  The attendance by blacks was so sparse that I had a good laugh."
"Fair enough, who wants to go to the beach or sit on the bus with a bunch of black crows."
"When Obama told the nation in the D.C. professor case that "" police acted stupidly "" before even knowing the facts----he told black America it was ok to hate police . When he told the nation last week that group Black Lives Matters was a justified group even though in their protests they chanted about wanting pigs in a blanket and wanting dead cops now---he told black America it's ok to attack police.  Obama sides based on color and  not the facts of each situation .  His very words are a wink to those blacks who use every event as a chance to steal and destroy others property .     And in other news : How many blacks slaughtered other blacks last night in Chicago ? It's clear Obama and Black Lives Matters don't care about lost black lives if the shooter is black."
""" The retired pediatric neurosurgeon ... is known for his personal high moral standards...""

Which are? 

I do know Trump recently attacked Republicans who weren't ""standing by"" their ""man"" when Trumps hateful sexual predatory comments came to light.

"In other words, you don't want to explain why you aren't a racist.  But liberals have no problem calling me one when it fits.  people do falsely claim racism to stifle debate.  And I have no desire to shut you up, just to quit lying about me.  If you need to lie, then you have no argument to make.  Now, about using black people, that's all liberals do.  They have deceived themselves into thinking their policies help and that blacks care about statues. 
  I provide evidence from the mouths of blacks that reject liberal policies because it is real.  Not to score political points.  BTW, there are no political points to score on this forum."

"Pull your head out Black.  Urban Alaska was at one time in the same circumstances as rural Alaska.  What makes you or urban Alaskan's so damn special that you deserve sanitation rights?  Rural Alaska is part of the state and shouldn't take infrastructure discrimination laying down.  State legislators should be ashamed of themselves for pouring billions of dollars into building access roads and bridges that we don't need.  It's long overdue to catch rural Alaska up with basic sanitation.  I don't know why the villagers don't come together, or use AFN to fight for basic sanitation once and for all. If you don't like it, MOVE."
"Why do you say universal health care is a disaster? Have you lived in the states? Paid the premiums for care which is available for the elites but having a doctor is not available to many many others.   Efficient patient care is necessary and changes are necessary but not to throw out the baby with the bathwater.  I WANT UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE!..  So did Obama, Hilary and Bernie... what Trump wants is simply to eliminate any good that Obama did BECAUSE HE IS BLACK!"
"We see you for who you are, Mr Black. Shameless."
The heck with whether or not the  legislators support it!  What about the people paying for it?  Scrap the whole darn thing and save us billions.  Even if we had to pay uncle sam back and bust it down we would still be in the black.
"Far too many of those who voted for trump fell for the right media rewrite of NAFTA and other trade agreement that were in fact creations of the Republican free trade platform. The very same misinformed people who voted for trump turned around and voted to return the very same reps and senators to DC that had in fact been the root cause of their dis-infranchisement. Venture capitalists like Romney took advantage of trade agreements to ship entire factories overseas but I'll bet ya didn't see much of that on Fox didja? What really aroused the trumpets was not economic issues but the lies that trump told about how he would get rid of the threatening brown people, contain the blacks and outlaw the Muslims. Plus it's now okay to grope the neighbor girl because after all the POTUS does it too. This was whitelash mr. kon. Insecure white people voting for a loud mouthed birther, sexist, racist, xenophobic, sexual predator because he allowed them to express openly their own racist tendencies."
"How so?  What liberal policy mandated that black families be torn apart, and how did it do so?"
"At least you are agreeing that blacks can be racist as well.  There are many that try to deny it.   I will never say that there are not racists on BOTH sides.  I am just using the No BLM sign as speech that lefties will shutdown without a second thought.    Yet when the right tries to say anything about free speech they say that we should not have it.  If they want to say something the right might disagree with, they claim that they are just using their free speech rights."
"Donald J Trump, the segregationist who was sued by the Department of Justice for repeatedly committing illegal anti-black housing discrimination is going to pardon disgraced former sheriff Joe Arpaio, a man convicted of contempt of court for ignoring a judge's orders to stop racial profiling.

"wow, the pot calling the kettle black.  the issue you keep posting about has been settled, you lost, so why use it to constantly denigrate the mayor about in every comment you post no matter what the subject matter is?  this kind of behavior shows how immature you are, like a little kid than cannot accept failure.  that incident with they mayor was just a minute fractions of what he does and yet because of it, you clam he is unfit to be mayor.  in your eyes it may have been unfair, but that does not mean he is a total failure as mayor.   and now you keep defending your actions, not wanted to let it go.  this clearly shows how vindictive and malicious person your are.

"Trump, with this action, confirms what we all know that Trump is a bigot and a racist unfit to serve as President.  Secondly, it is okay for transgenders to die for their country but not fight for their constitutional rights.

"Sorry Steven, don't see how that's racist.  Obama (whose name backwards in Latin means 'I will love', and might be intepreted as vaguely lecherous) had an non-American father.  If he'd been, say, Slovenian, the level of suspicion concerning his citizenship would have been the same.  
Of course, Melania was Slovenian, and her name comes from the Greek μελαινα, which means black, or to the medically inclined (as 'melaena'), 'black stool resulting from an upper GI bleed'.  So if Trump were a racist, would he marry someone whose name means 'black'?  That's civil marriage, of course, because it was his third. 
Anyway, getting back to football, this afternoon I watched the local second XV take on Tunbridge Wells.

Don't spend your life anguishing over the injustice. Boys/men are pigs. If you're an adult woman and are surprised by this, I point you toward all of human history. Henry the VIII, JFK, Bill, and every rock star you can think of. Alpha males get away with more, because the tribe figures he's the most fit, and he should have more kids than the rest of us losers. This will make the tribe stronger. Not all Alphas are so worthy, of course, but broadly speaking....

Fortunately, we might be able to do this ""for the kkk/Nazi's protection.  I bet a lot of people wished they had fought back against Hitler in 1932, and the KKK after the Civil War.

Physiology confers benefit to males in muscle fiber, O2 carrying, bone structure...and, it's disgusting to see a Fallon Fox end the career of a black female boxer inside a couple of minutes in the ring - smashed her eye orbit.  Many fans were there to see black lesbian get beat badly by a guy.

This is not sportsMANlike.  Transgender should compete with each other not against the opposite sex. 

I think we have like one female who identifies as transgender winning against males - mostly this is natal males showing up female athletes.  

If female athletes don't boycott, we might need to hit advertisers.  Women earned Title IX for a reason, it's being destroyed by genderists."
"There is enough social glue out there and its going to be applied when diverse groups of Democrats and leftists come out in defense of working people, immigrants, African-Americans and other people of color, the poor, students, women and others targeted by the Trump fascists. 
The glue does not appear by magic but by the actual social act of coming together as groups of people opposed to fascism. Clearly, fascists will not join in the effort and do not know what to do except go along with the authoritarians and the Tyrant they have set loose on their own countrymen but history always remembers such craven sheep--the racists, the clinic bombers, the religious fanatics--captured in photographs, described in literature, and detested in the hearts of righteous people.

   From a 21 year former Marine that saw combat operations on 2 continents, I am disgusted by the manufactured indignation and ambivalence of so many against the few who are trying to bring to light a very real problem of people like them having their basic rights as an American violated.

But you can also ask why you're being asked to leave because that reason may give you a case for prejudiced civil suit which is why she didn't want to answer. 

The fact that after all of this she wants them to return is what is incredulous.  She invited them, kicked just the black half out and then requested he return?  Uh yeah ok... This isn't a private property issue it's clearly a social disconnect issue. 

She insulted the man and actually had the nerve to comment on his ability to speak well?  Why because he's black she's surprised he was able to conduct himself intelligently? It's those comments that make her look like an arse. 

The real point is being overlooked and that's the problem."

"Truman was nominally a member of the Klan, from 1920 to 1922, between two and three years.  He paid dues but there is no record of his ever participating.  1922 was the years Truman entered politics as an elected county court judge.  Truman was pro-Catholic and Pro-Jewish, which put him at odds with the Klan.  McKinley was an Ohio Republican, when the Klan was Southern and anti-Republican.  Wilson was racist but there is no record he ever was a member of the Klan.  Harding took a strong anti-Klan stance and appointed Blacks to federal offices. Coolidge was a Vermonter, where there was no Klan activity.  Most legitimate historians call your right-wing invented history, ""hogwash"".  Some of you folks will swallow absolutely anything!"

"You make a valid point intellectually. But it stinks to make it an issue as it's been the formal mode of address since the USA was founded. The military is an entirely different creature in America, (i.e. we Americans have never had a military takeover). We choose our leaders by vote. 
   It stinks because it diminishes former presidents, and it reeks right now because our most recent former president is from a long marginalized class of Americans.

"A handful of really bad police officers have cast the demonic, racist taint on police officers across the nation.

Blame these officers who got away with murder."

"Sadly I can only endorse what Carsten notes. Saddest of all is that it has to be a race issue but that is what you get when you are part of, or go along with an unprincipaled and immoral system - the a preference  based on skin colour. Apartheid was just as immoral and one would think the new SA would have learnt from that. My whine; we also tender for work but have to give at least 10% or 20% advantage to ""black"" companies as well as deal with the widespread corruption and incompetence in state entities, and of the whole system including the rating of companies BEE status. ""Private"" developments are also hungry for BEE points and often have a preference for ""black"" companies.

But we have an ironic chuckle and try and rationalise the whole rotten system as the cost of doing business in SA, just as I imagine we might rationalise having to pay bribes in say, Zimbabwe or Nigeria. It is all legalised corruption. Rather focus on honesty and equality than skin colour."
"People who have more brains that God gave a rutabaga understand that the Three-Fifths Compromise was an accomplishment by the Abolitionists to give the slave states LESS power in Congress by reducing the number seats in the House they'd get by 40%.  More power to the slave states would have meant less power to black people enslaved in those states.

And, by the way, it wasn't illegal to secede.  The New England states (and New York) considered seceding for ten years, and no one ever suggested they couldn't.  Ending Slavery wasn't Lincoln's objective; collecting taxes from the South was.  It was only later than he made freeing the slaves an issue by issuing the Emancipating Proclamation, which didn't actually free any slaves, because it only applied to the Confederate States, who didn't recognize his authority.  The Slaves weren't freed until the ratification of the 13th Amendment.  Tens of thousands of Union soldiers deserted when Lincoln issued that proclamation."

"""Those protesting, have a point......statues and remembrances of a society's past have every right to continue standing.""

That is an absurd premise and conveniently denies history itself. Look at Germany and Italy post-WWII for an example of a more mature approach to putting the past in context. The Nazi and fascist past will not be erased but in Europe this period can and is discussed and their horrific crimes can stand as a warning to future generations. That is exactly how the Confederate symbols should be treated. They absolutely can and should be moved from prominent places of honour not least because they deeply offend so many, especially black Americans."
America is not racist generally. Asians are well liked and respected. But Blacks is different. They are often hit with police brutality.  Cops are just human and frustrated by the high crime rate and the revolving door system of prison and they are afraid of being shot first and act their anger. No sitting or any reaction to the flag or anthem will change that.
"Doesn't matter; my point was that you can find all sorts of articles about how good/bad Obama's presidency was.

"Where is the outrage? The ink on the newspaper is not even dry.  We all should be outraged by racist attacks and by the non-racist carnage occurring daily in our cities and towns like the black-on-black murders in Chicago, which rarely get reported in the media.  Why is that?  I think it is because the non-racist carnage is the new norm in America and of not much interest to many Americans whereas a racist attack such as in this story is of more interest and better for readership.  And why did you have to politicize it by suggesting Trump is not doing anything about it?  You seem not to know that primary responsibility for law enforcement in the U.S. belongs to towns, cities and states and not the Federal government.  Trump has spoken out forcefully about the carnage occurring across the U.S. and has urged local authorities to do more to fight it. What other political figure has spoken out about it?"

"Good article Jonah, these protests are simply to forward a false narrative that America is a racists country. While critical analysis of that concept so easily destroys it, a large portion of American's have been duped into the fallacy.

"While I appreciate the nod to Muhammed Ali's great moral courage and strength of conviction, I'm not sure that the comparison is exactly apt.

"Missing the point.

My point was that, by only listening to conservative blacks, you are choosing to ignore anything else that counters that view. Plus, by referring to it as the ""plantation"", you are implying that any black people that vote Democrat must not be smart enough to come around your perspective and those of the black conservatives you mention.

I didn't say anything about my worldview....but, here it is. I attended a smaller public university (about 6000 students) in a city of about 27,000 in Nebraska. Not exactly Berkeley or Boulder. I have yet to teach in a county that went blue in any presidential election held during my time there. I was a Fox News viewer until about March of 2008, when I got tired of Sean Hannity telling me what was and wasn't un-American, unpatriotic, etc.....not to mention most of their other BS shows (minus Shepard Smith). I was also a Mike Rosen listener once upon a time. IOH, my worldview was partially shaped by conservative windbags."
What a racist story . If the legislator weren't a negro or republican nothing would be said about it.  Legislators don't have to explain their actions.

Treating the office with respect, regardless of its occupant, has always seemed the prudent approach, though that had been tested when reciprocity was turned on its head by the redefining of words such as ""sex"" and ""is,"" thereby challenging this father of young, inquisitive daughters.

"Contemporary anti-discrimination laws have reduced themselves to absurdity.  In the 1960s, national legislation against racial discrimination ""affecting interstate commerce"" made sense, because racial equality was an issue forced upon the nation by history and numbers (about 12% of the population was black), and one which affected the well-being and future of the United States in numerous practical ways.  From that common-sense beginning, we've arrived at quarreling at the level of townships about laws governing the use of bathrooms by perhaps 0.1% of the population.  What's next, Christian bathrooms for those who don't want to pee next to Muslims?  Asexual bathrooms for those who don't want to be gender stereotyped by a sign on a door?

You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”

 allowed to see his body when he was brought back to the states so that she would know without a doubt that it was his body in the box?  Why the secrecy?`"
"And why should the President of the United states not have the right to speak out to his beliefs ? Isn't that what this is all about ? The right to stand (or sit) for what you believe ? There are a lot of people out there who are applauding Trumps position on this. 

Unfortunately here we are not allowed to talk about or try to reconcile  police violence against blacks because the Globe censors discussion on it. But do your own homework on the issue. There are never absolutes in life but in my opinion mitigating reasons why so many black men fall prey to cop violence. And change comes with discussion not censorship."
"""Good people"", meaning they don't beat their wives and steal from the church collection plate? Sure, that's possible. But people who carry guns while marching to defend anti-black, anti-Semitic principles? No, those are not ""good people"". Honestly, you apologists have to be kidding yourselves."
"I've never considered not standing for the national anthem and I've always enjoyed the sense of unity it brings, but with the way things are going in this country under extremist leadership, especially for minorities and women, I am considering it. If the game had been at Mile High I would have sat in solidarity with the players. I find it inspiring rather than disappointing that so many across the NFL stood in unison with their ""son of a b"" teammates. 
I personally find it astonishing that people cannot accept a peaceful form form of protest and concern. It in no way indicates someone is less respectful or patriotic than you just because you stand and they don't. I actually find it quite disturbing that many people are perfectly fine watching and cheering for black athletes on their team - as long as they behave well - as soon as they have an opinion different then theirs and are out of line in their eyes, they go ballistic. Says a lot. 
I gained a lot of respect for the NFL today."
"Exactly - they have so many special privileges. This is a race thing- on their part. So many blacks support others of their own race no matter what they do. They want special ""vicitm"" privileges. Wish they would really LISTEN to MLK's speech, ""the content of their  CHARACTER, not the color of their skin"" those that are kneeling are showing the content of their character - and people don't like it. Protest on your own time, or do something that is actually going to help people, like encouraging youth to work hard and obey the law!"
"Actually, according to what I read on the web site of the Death Penalty Information Center, any federal prosecutor wanting to prosecute under the death penalty has to get ""personal written permission from the Attorney General of the United States. Apparently, this may be due to the ""seemingly racial bias""  in federal death penalty cases. The defendant in this case is not black but he is Hispanic. 
So, it might be Jeff Session whose has the final say if the prosecutor decides to go for the death penalty. 
Have no idea if this man had any prior convictions or if he is a pillar of the community. 
My guess is that they will not go for the death penalty. Of course, they might decide to make a ""statement"" about domestic violence (which would be great) and this case does fall under VAWA. That might be a way to ""say"" Trump takes violence against women seriously, political move? 
What do you think ?"
"Excuse me. I'm a very old black man, and I've heard black people complaining about confederate statues my entire life.  How would you like to have a statue to someone who fought a war to keep you enslaved. George Washington and Thomas Jefferson did not lead an insurrection against their country that resulted in 500,000 deaths.  That's who we are honoring with these confederate statues."
"Your hatred in continuing to call these men murderers in multiple posts must be grounded in equally hated racism and bigotry.  Nothing you offer beyond pure hatred for 4 individuals found to be unjustly incarcerated for 18 years.  You have apparently not ""recovered"" from the black soul generating these vile statements."
"I wonder how the Ryerson students would deal with the iconic Mohawk chief Joseph Brant, who owned 20 or more negro slaves."
"I've found that people who deflect police brutality by talking about Chicago murders are racists.  ""Why are they complaining about cops killing unarmed blacks when their own are killing more!  You straighten out that Chicago problem and then we'll tell our cops to stop killing unarmed blacks""."
"The tragic attack in Dallas is emblematic of, I fear, an escaclating cycle of violence between radical elements of the Black community and the police. Each incident of violence brings more violence. Now, the planned execution of five officers will take this conflict to a whole new level. I fear we’re headed for some very difficult and dangerous times for all of us.

I think, fear is the operative word here. As things escalate, fear increases and trust diminishes, leading to more liklihood of “untended” violence. Then, add planned, intentional attacks on the police as we just saw in Dallas, and, understandably, the level of anger increases among officers. On the “flip side”, each questionable shooting of Black men increases the anger among African Americans. Fear…..distrust…..anger…… a recipe for disaster. Then mix-in our polarized and factionalized politics and beware of a nationwide explosion… IMO, we all need to work together to try to de-escalate things… with hope, Gary Crum"

American's have trouble with female leaders, some Americans. We wonder why when the first comment use 'shrill' 'lecture' etc... Oh yeah there's the ""B"" word too although the PC folks have taught us this isn't to be said aloud in polite company...but it's there in Trump and too many mouths.

"Hill spouts divisive commentary all day long. Whenever a black player commits a crime or is suspended, it's never because the player made a mistake or poor decision.  It's because ""America is racist and the system is pitted against black people"".

"Do you really feel that sorry for yourself all the time? That is very sad. Also, I love how it is acceptable to dismiss a Jewish academic as just some douchebag member of the ""privileged class."" When this man was a kid  there was literally an organized campaign to murder millions of Jewish people. And you think it is worse to be black in today's Canada, because occasionally you may face an off colour joke (and then get to have the power to fire a person who is far more accomplished than you)? Who is the real privileged class here? The university is meeting all these students' demands. They are the winners, not the prof."
"Guns in the hands of law abiding people who have taken training can help to keep others safe.  But you make it sound simple and it's not.  Guns in the hands of police do keep people safe.  But guns in the hands of hardened criminals, in a city with the strictest gun laws, result in many black men being killed by other black men.  That's not BS."
That's hilarious.  You are saying if you are black there are people all over the place taking shots at you.  That actually is only happening if you are a Crip or a  Blood and the other team is taking a shot at you.  You are a hilarious stereotype.

"In July of 2016, an avowed black nationalist murdered five police officers during a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Dallas, Texas. The act of violence was well-planned and was motivated entirely by the hate-filled ideology of the shooter, Micah Xavier Johnson.

With several officers dead by the hand of a committed black nationalist, one might think the Obama administration may have considered the assassinations domestic terror and launched an investigation into groups associated with this ideology.

Not at all.

Barack Obama condemned the shootings, but he did not call out or even allude to Johnson’s hateful views. He did, however, blame “powerful weapons” for the violence.

Hypocrisy from MSW, progressives and the wonderbra media. Who would have thought it?"
"The ANC's talk of radical economic transformation now, after more than  is a simple demonstration of their failure.

"I am sorry but everywhere - and I mean everywhere - in the Western world, the majority of urban shootings and murders are perpetuated by black males. No matter the country's history, culture, language spoken, food habits etc. the story remains the same.

It is a cultural problem and one that only blacks themselves can resolve.

It's not disrespecting the flag or the country or anything else to take a knee in protest over police killings that go unpunished, which started the protest movement in the NFL and which continues to be a stain on our nation today. Black Lives Matter is about cops killing unarmed African-Americans for no justified reason, not the other way around. Anyone casual reader of the news can see that. Only those who tolerate unequal treatment and taking away civil liberties support Trump. We didn't fight wars so people could stand for the national anthem. They were fought to preserve democracy and the constitutional right to protest against government policy. The NFL players who are exercising that right are more doing their patriotic duty to ensure there really is ""justice for all."""
That was one ridiculous article.  The BLM posters at BC should not have been damaged but destroyed.  Blacks in this country are only oppressed now because they want to be.  The Russians have nothing to do with the self oppression of the African-Amercians.

You should see the problem here.  Nobody knows anymore what anyone is protesting about (YOU didn't even know about this latest protest).  Go ahead and protest the National Anthem...as long as you know your protest message will be lost in the shuffle (unless each player wears a sign on them saying what they are protesting for).  Sure, it's 100% legal to protest during the National Anthem...but 100% the wrong way since they only muddy up their issue and have it get lost.

But to charge wealthy people more for the same service is not a solution, but just a shifting of responsibility that will create other problems downstream.

Far better to establish a cost + small % rate, limited to say R200 and give that free to every household  (no matter what your income or area), and increase it exponentially according to usage. Rich households will obviously spend more, and poor households will try and stay within the minimum. The City did this with water, and it worked rather well.

"That drug prohibition was used in the US specifically to target the black population is known.  Is it the same in Canada?  For First Nations, the incarceration rate it disproportionately high - more due to alcohol.  There isn't as large % of blacks in Canada, especially in the west, so does the US style targeting also happen here?  Not suggesting it doesn't, but haven't seen as much evidence for it however that could be a west/east difference?  Sometimes it seems to me that people assume that since it happens south of the border, it also happens here to the same extent?

What a bigoted statement.   The Dakota have so much as said they will not leave by peaceful means. The immediate looking to the race of those using water-cannons on those disobeying a court order is almost amusing.  But has Mr. Caponigro even checked the race of the law-enforcers?

I don't believe there's a conversation in reality or in theory that will make a difference regarding the inarguable racism in the US. There were slaves in Jamestown a decade before the Puritans arrived. By the time Martin Luther King, Jr. was marching for civil rights in the 1960s, either legal or de facto economic slavery and legal or de facto murderous open violence toward Black people had been going on for over 350 years. I know, ""look what they do to themselves and us"" appears makes sense if you look at crime stats from 2015. How we got where we are has been a very long time coming, and we aren't here because good people died in the mud for equal rights, as noble as that sounds.   We're here because far more people died under far worse conditions for a very long time, and this isn't a values debate about ideals."

Not true.  Places like the Pacific Club & Punahou School not that long ago were Caucasians only.  Some military stationed in Hawaii from the deep South or even someone like Sarah Palin from Alaska or the current Danno are very uncomfortable with Hawaii's racial makeup.  However they know they are completely outnumbered and will keep their deep personal beliefs under wraps until they leave Hawaii.   University of Hawaii administrators are almost all Caucasians but they are smart enough to not mess with the Hawaiian studies department and let them do whatever they want.  DOE is opposite of UH and controlled by mostly Asians.  Even the new DOE Superintendent has an Asian last name and seeing her on TV she is part Asian.  Obama in his book talked about racism against Blacks in Hawaii.  You only see the racism that you want to see in Hawaii but it comes from all sides and all colors.

"No, I do not.   You have apparently missed my posts in which I denounce BOTH sides in this circle of hatred.

She was in costume as the author, promoting the book of the author...hardly gestures of any disrespect...but showing unawareness of how easily, and quickly and vehemently, such demonstrations can be misinterpreted and politicized.

This reminds me of an incident from several years ago, in which a high school teacher used the word ""niggardly"" in a lecture, to which a black student took offense and complained to the administration and media...the teacher was pilloried...and perhaps forced to resign, although memory isn't clear on that part."
Are you kidding me ?   Take just one city---Chicago---blacks there kill more blacks than all the blacks killed by police in the entire country .  How come Black Lives Matters don't care about those black lives ? How come Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson don't care enough about those black lives to march against all those killings ? How come Obama doesn't speak out against all those black on black killings ? How come NFL players don't care about those lives ?  For that matter---why don't you care about all those black lives ended at the hands of other blacks year after year after year after year ?   The NFL restricts everything the players wear and when police were killed in Dallas they wouldn't let NFL players where something to bring attention to that tragedy.  Yet if it's an anti-American protest as in not standing for the flag---they are all for it.   Only 10 percent of players disrespected their country yesterday but to hear the liberal press dishonestly tell it---nearly all did.
"IRT HapaGuy, and the Asian, Blacks, and Native Americans were fighting the Nazi's and Japanese.  The Asians, Blacks, and Native Americans were all just Americans, and presented a very special lesson in WWII, they all bled red and were all Americans.  The American government policies changed after WWII accepting all born in the United States as Americans.  Then in 1952 came the McCarran/Walter Act allowing the Issei Japanese, who adopted America as their Country, and sending their son's and daughter's into combat to become Naturalized American citizens.  Some 40,000 Issei's from about 1954 to 1964 became Americans.  I remember my grand-mother holding the American flag in 1960 after the swearing in and how proud she was after sending three son's into three different Wars.  And, remember some 110,000 Americans were interned in camps because American leaders did not trust them."

He asked if they felt their schools are better or their jobs more secure. He asked if they felt their health care was better under Obama.  He asked them if they believe Democrats will protect and defend them from crime and violence. Many black Americans could not say so publicly out of fear for their personal safety . but said no in the voter booth."
"Are you arguing that the preferential treatment of Naspers was affirmative action under any other name? If we were talking about a straight business transaction, an open tender, I would agree with you, as long as the same rules of preferential Afrikaner upliftment were equally applied to each tender.  Party funding by businesses is also, as you say, normal and natural. However, if Naspers had been selling canned peaches and was funding the Nationalist Party as a quid pro quo in return for a lucrative government contract, would you still think it was OK? I would argue that that would be corruption, even if the beneficiaries on both sides were still traumatised and disadvantaged after a terrible atrocity, as the Boers were at that time, and as black people are today. But this deal wasn't canned peaches. This was the manipulation of minds. Propaganda. Even in the context of the day, it was a devil's deal."
"I never said ""94%"" of black voters are paid by welfare.  I may have said that 94% vote Democrat, and they all have friends, neighbors, and relatives who are on welfare, which is about 22% of the black population.  The other 78% who aren't on welfare support the Democrat welfare program so they don't have to take care of their ne'er-do-well friends, neighbors, and relatives themselves.  The 78% who completed their education, got jobs, didn't have babies before they got married, and didn't commit crimes are doing pretty well in this not-as-racist-as-you-imply society.

It's poor personal choices that land people on the Welfare Plantation. Race has little to do with it.  Attitude has almost everything to do with it."
"Carey9,
My use of race naming is in the historical context of the article and books on the subject. 
Black Americans were referred to by either ""colored"" or ""negro"", and Japanese-American as ""Jap"" in historical documents.
I have NO problem at all with not using race, religion, political party, or gender as identifying words or by their given name. 
In order to communicate with various groups and to be understood by a wider audience  I try to use the ""words"" that are respectful. 
Some people want to be recognized by their culture or race.
Most Alaska Natives and Native Americans prefer to be called Alaska Native, First Nations, Aboriginal or Indigenous, or bytheir tribe (Haida women dancing).
It gets really confusing trying to remember who wants to be called what. 
Not sure if it would be simpler to refer to people as just human beings or by other identifiers.

"Thanks, Jim. I couldn't get the second link to work, but read the bit on the first. I am unsurprised that there are more options in the Bay Area.  I'd assure the pastor there, however, that his church is not the only one in the US hosting a Black Jesus. That's how He's styled here at St. Sabina."
"Yeah, the experience of welfarism the last 50 years has done WONDERS for the poor and the blacks in this country, Michael."
Would it surprise you if I told you I was Black?  Maybe you should engage with people instead of making assumptions about them based on their comments to others.
"Still, no one can tell me how protesting the national anthem has anything to do with police picking on black people...which in and of itself is a spurious claim at best.  Are there individual racist cops that have done inappropriate things?  Of course.  And when/if they do act in a racist manner, they should be (and are) punished appropriately.  Is there a systemic based racism in all cops.  Nope.  But again I'll ask, can anyone explain to me how kneeling for our national anthem is somehow related to cops?  And is it really a wise way to protest cops when the correlation between cops and our national flag is extremely weak and most people know it will be taken as an affront to the military?"
"There are those that still support the idea of affirmative action. and do currently support black lives matter, open borders,  sanctuary cities, endless welfare for both indinginous persons and immigrants(legal or otherwise),  and of course N.A.T.O, who just recently argued that the United States should pay repirations to Black persons due to historical slavery within the States. And then we must ask ourselves what motivates BIG MONEY (George Soros comes to mind) to fund these things. This in turn causes the recipients to hold a sense of entitlement. In other words, they feel they are owed something, yet have no sense of responsibility to those things they believe they are owed. And then there is the schools who further instigate this by teaching these things to our kids as being acceptable.  The operative word from this would be entitlement, and it explains nearly everything we are experiencing all the way down to the local level, and it is cleary an engineered event."
"Hugh -

You are criticizing slavery - the most severe racism.  We can all agree with that - especially as it applies to the history of much of the nation. 

But what part of  the kidnapping of blacks, the inhuman conditions afforded them, the murder carried out against them or their use as ""animals of pleasure"" was actually carried out against them here in Oregon - by the generation that created the University of Oregon and paid taxes and donated money and livestock to the building of Deady Hall? Or by the generation who, over thirty years after the Civil War, named the hall after Deady. 

The answer is not one one-hundredth of one per cent.

Instead, the majority of early Oregon voters made Oregon a free state and many went to war wearing Union blue."
"Years ago I knew a Danish born farmer in Zimbabwe who had a prosperous mango farm. He was a decent guy who provided decent wages and free schooling for his black worker children. A mobile health clinic visited weekly.

When he publicly supported the political opposition Mugabe's thugs burnt his farm to the ground and left everyone destitute. The dictator has destroyed the economy and, consequently, trashed food exports and manufactures which provided income for a deteriorating health care system."
Wikipedia shows at least two black ministers in high leadership positions - members of the Seventy headquartered in Utah - and the first black Seventy ordained back in the 1800s.
"But it was mostly black? Uh no it was mostly some sort of southern accent.  Someone on the comments posted every word he spoke and included an explanation of what he said. 

The victim whose page is Duce Diz was not some great guy he was a cocaine dealer.  Honestly were better off without both of them on the streets."

"'native americans' are imports, too, just like spaniards, italians, and africans. they came from somewhere, maybe before you and me, but they came. the Jews were given their land. they are a separate and set-apart people."
"Imagine if you will, a person is presented with the choice to either be right, or to be happy.  Most times either outcome is mutually exclusive.  If my defense is ""But I have every right to..."", happy is done, history, has saturated my presence with it's absence, period.  If you don't believe me, just ask any black man, or woman, or Hispanic, or Muslim, etc.  This fact is only surprising to those of us who feel entitled."
"I read the article and I don't think the author makes his point at all. To keep my comment short, I will give one example of what I see as the usual double-standard :""But more importantly, the refusal of service to gay couples is itself an arbitrary act. It is an act of domination – just like refusal of service to black or Jewish people or inter-racial couples. ""
So, isn't it an act of domination when a photographer or baker, etc., is now forced to provide their services for a same sex wedding by the government? Refusing to provide your services for a same sex wedding is not even close to simply refusing to serve those same persons in the usual day to day dealings in life.
And why is it just a problem of people drawing lines only from a religious standpoint? Plenty of people have refused to serve certain people or groups for political reasons and no one says anything. But refuse on religious grounds and people get sued. This is flat out wrong."
"First off it is true that some people in this country do disrespect black lives, just as it is true that some people disrespect Asian lives, and Latino lives.  This does not mean the entire country does.  In fact, most laws passed in the last fifty years have been highly favorable to minorities.  Inclusiveness, we have to be inclusive.   Diversity, we have to be diverse.   Multicultural, we have to be multicultural.   Any of these statements sound familiar?  They should.  They have been repeated constantly in the news and in public media for decades.  What is it that we celebrate for the entire month of February?   Is it how much we disrespect  a certain class of people?  Or is it how much we promote them?  When there are so many ways that we go out of our way to promote that class of people, do not try to say with a straight face that we disrespect them."
Jo Strabuchinkoskowitzenheimer doesn't realize that Trump discriminated against blacks in the 70's by not letting them rent his properties.  Can you tell me why that isn't a racist action?
"WOW - talk about the pot calling the kettle black.

As if Davie Shipyard didn't pull strings in the past to get deals they couldn't possibly complete on time."
"Perhaps you should check the statistics as they don't support the narrative. Young black men are involved with a significantly higher percentage of violent crimes so it stands to reason they might be targeted by police.  Black men are also significantly more prone to being killed by other black men, why isn't that part of the conversation?  Why aren't they upset about what is happening in Chicago?  Protesting because Trump made a benign statement??  Give me a break!  The Broncos and NFL players are anything, but concerned about young black men in America.  Most could not even tell you why they were kneeling.  The Bureau of Justice Statistics will tell you all you need to know.  As for the Broncos and the NFL, they have proven what I have always believed....they will do/say anything to protect their brand."
"Yes, its shocking isnt it?  How dare black and brown people demand things like equality,equity, and human rights;  why cant they should just grateful for what we give them?  For heavens sake, look how much police resources they have, they cant get halfway out of their driveways without one of our own stopping them to make sure they're ok.  (SMIRK)."

"If there is a civil war due to the election being rigged there wouldn't be enough military, jails and police to control the amount of people rioting that are voting for him. that would mean close to half the country. It could be a good thing beings the gov't is already corrupt as well as the police as we already see the amount of unarmed black people being shot on a regular everyday occurrence."
They are referring to Black Lives Matter.
"I like the skills angle and yes in my experience and opinion that is the real problem. Business still needs to do the job they get paid to do. No point in enforcing black quotas when the job isn't getting done. I can get 10 black managers now but for my company they don't mean all that much. They can't really do anything except maybe if they are politically connected but those seems to be fleeting at best. So why employ a quota worker when I can source work to overseas companies and workers and bring the product back at a profit? Enforce your stick. It will mean more work for me. This here new South Africa can't do anything without consultants and contractors. One day the black taxpayers will wake up and realize they are paying 10x more then they should be paying and the government will tel then if was the mandate they gave to the government. Oh and another thing I have observed, government tends to chase away skills while promoting and rewarding inefficiency and incompetence."
"I just looked at his mugshot.  

When he is convicted and sent to prison under measure 11, he will be yet another black person who many on the R-G site tell me are prosecuted and convicted only because they are black not because of their own actions."
Is it just me? Or do black men who date Kardashians not end up faring too well?
"A key piece of information to add insight.  Michael Strickland was badly beat up at a prior protest involving a progressive of sorts, and his assailant was I believe convicted of this assault.  
                                                                                                                              
This said we could really use some kind of preparatory mediation between groups representing libertarians as Michael, progressives, and others to bring an understanding of how we will conduct political demonstration going forward.   Pulling a gun really escalates a political confrontation.  And it isn't even in keeping with Michael's own wish to be a citizen journalist.
                                                                  
Our politicians such as Pres. Obama are really failing.  They pander to Black Lives Matter who berate the police into not even policing places like parts of Chicago.  Then, he asks to take guns from people needing to defend themselves. Ug"

"Race baiters like this author are actually terrified that President Trump will help the inner cities and free the black population from the shackles of the Democratic Party that keeps them in those terrible, hopeless and dependent conditions.  I predict that should Trump make some headway in this respect, his share of the black vote will rise in 2020 to 20% from 8% in 2016."
"Rick, it is not spin, it is fact. As far as the idea that we have to make special dispensation for anyone who has been historically discriminated against due to whatever reason, we would be forever doing that for almost every ethnic group, from the Irish and Italians to the blacks and Asians. I prefer that all people be treated equally in every endeavor without regard to color, creed, religion or any other quality that defines anyone. Lastly, the republican party is NOT the party of racism and racists anymore than the current democratic party is. I do not think that highlight a persons race, ethnicity, background helps the situation because when you bestow special dispensation to one group, many of the other groups resent it and makes the situation worse. That is human nature, something that we all have to recognize and deal with logically. As a very smart person told me once, approach determines response. I should not have to explain that idea."
"Hi DC,

Regarding this quote:  “Oregon’s long flirtation with exclusion laws had finally ended. But while the exclusion laws were rarely enforced, the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.” p. 171  What evidence does Nokes present that ""... the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.”  Opinion is fine but opinion as fact is disingenuous.

I think the Mims Memorial is a great idea and a great addition to Eugene.  If Eugene was smart, the city would develop a self guided walking tour that is sort of like a scavenger hunt where the strollers/walkers move from site to site.  My wife and I have seen and done these in other cities, Asheville, NC has a particularly fun and interesting one.  If you are ever for it, walk the solar system in Eugene.  Make sure you touch each and every planet, to include the sun."
"About a year ago I saw a short segment on ""Diversity"" in IT. Not too surprisingly the manager being interviewed described ""Diversity"" as a strength and gave an example of a black IT worker being able to solve some problem. 

The only thing was, as I was listening to this, I thought, 'Yeah, that's pretty much what any competent systems analyst would do to solve this problem.' And there are a lot of things you do in IT that are simply 'problem solving', such as debugging a report to determine why a number in a report is wrong. And regardless of what your background is, you'd probably go through the same steps. 

It is when the 'Diversity Advocates' start pushing the party line to the point where it starts sounding suspect that I get turned off."
"Nobody is making the argument that the players don't have the right to kneel. I haven't seen or heard that at all. They're arguing that their boss should fire them for disrespecting millions of the people whose money pays their salaries. Like when the owner of Chick-fil-A said he thought marriage was a man plus woman type deal. Or the owner of Hobby Lobby said something to the same effect. Or someone didn't want to make a gay wedding cake. Or said something off color on Facebook. Or wanted to speak his or her political opinions at Berkeley, they wanted his book deal taken away. Now that you mention it, it appears that the Left is a tad jealous that someone is using their go-to tactic and it's working. 

Odd that a bunch of racists would idolize and buy and wear the jerseys of black players in a sport that is 70% comprised of blacks. Just a thought here, but maybe they disagree with the claims concerning the police made by groups like BLM. Maybe there are some numbers that support this."
"This had nothing to do with the military. Here was Kaep's statement on why he was doing it: 

""SANTA CLARA, Calif. -- San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick has willingly immersed himself into controversy by refusing to stand for the playing of the national anthem in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against African Americans and minorities in the United States...

""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in an exclusive interview after the game. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""

Definitely don't want to beat a dead horse, just thought it important to be clear on the reason, whether we agree with him or not. I do think people conflated what he did with inferences and assumptions about the military, but it's not true."
"What about the 60,000 to 93,000 free blacks who fought in uniform for the Confederacy????  Though records are spotty...because of the vast destruction in the south during the war....Blacks started fighting in 1861.  The Union didn't allow blacks in uniform until late 1863!  The war itself was not fought over the issue of slavery,  but state's rights (slavery being ONE of the issues).  There never would have been a war IF the S. Carolinians hadn't fired on Ft. Sumpter, and if Lincoln didn't respond militarily to ""Preserve the Union""...which was the reason behind the war (not slavery).  The ""flag"" you are so upset about isn't the Confederate States flag, but the Battle Flag of the Army of Northern Virginia.  It was and is still an ""American Flag.""  (Also, there were 6 northern states, or under federal control where slavery was lawful, until AFTER 1865.) Emancipation Proc. only freed slaves in the seceded states!"
"Boodrow Malone wrote, ""Time for statistic: a black man in the USA is EIGHTEEN time more likely to murder a policeman than i policeman is to kill a black man for any reason.""

"Sorry,  I won't miss a polished race hustler like Obama who deliberately kept the Black community angry and resentful as a President, ruined the US economy, and has a disaster as a foreign policy.  Don't worry, he isn't going away,   He will continue his race hustling domestically internationally undermining his own country and getting filthy rich by doing it.   By the way.  Ask the Black community what he has ever done for them?"
"Oh dear, I guess we're not supposed to notice certain, ahem, things.

Which must be why the following comment was rejected. It couldn't be because it was uncivil, or disrespectful. Just a little too close to the truth:

""So, I guess the future of hockey is for its athletes to become the physically gifted but arrogant, spoiled children that dominate basketball, football and baseball.

So far removed from everyday life and people, athletes in those sports, mostly black, move in a world where normal rules and decorum do not exist. Scowling ""gangsta"" athletes, with their entourages, vapor trails of abandoned kids and wives, and quickly diminishing bank accounts in their post playing days.

Yes, that may well be the future of hockey. No more ""aw shucks"" humility, fake or not.

I'll pass"""
"So much terrible violence was done by those awful liberal counter-protesters in Charlottesville.  

There was the grusome beating of the Emancipation Park lawn by the feet of counter-protesters fleeing Richard Preston as he shot at them.  

There was the despicable damage done to James Field's beautiful car by Heather Heyer's body and the bodies of 19 other vicious counter-protesters as he mowed them down in it.  

And of course there is the impending dismantling of Robert E Lee's gorgeous metallic horsey-riding likeness, ending it's all too brief 93 year run of intimidating the black citizens of Charlottesville and celebrating Lee's unsuccessful attempt to destroy America and perpetuate slavery with a war that killed close to 1 million people.

We must stop these liberals from abusing our lawns with their feet as they flee gun violence, wrecking our cars with their bodies as we run them over and destroying our horsey-riding statues to our enemies' slavery-championing war heros!"
"He's not a leftist. He's an extremist with mixed feelings. A very confused and troubled individual. 

Donald Trump is loved by right-wing extremists, particularly racists, and some of those extremists feel energized by his election. Racists are his people. He has made is very clear through words and actions that the State will treat racism in much the same wink-wink nudge-nudge way that it was treated in the bad old days where people may have been equal on paper, but justice was non-existent for minority groups. Leftist extremism will obviously not be well tolerated, but it never really has been after the Revolutionary war."
"The cost of these 'feral', as you call them, horses, is due to the fact that they were rounded up from their native ranges by BLM, costing American taxpayers millions of dollars, and now need to be fed, for more millions of dollars. Put them back, and that cost goes away. Less than 2% of the BLM's annual budget is spent applying PZP (porcine zone pellucida) fertility control. Doing more of that would create jobs and reduce population growth. The National Academy of Sciences completed a report, requested by BLM, and concluded that BLM should concentrate on fertility control rather than roundups. That recommendation has been ignored."
As opposed to 1/3 black?
"The reality is, black market weed will and always will be cheaper and easier to obtain.  Less risky too.  For medical marijuana prescription holders nothing good can come from legalisation.   Prices will increase overall.  

However, I suspect now that the government is in the weed game, black market providers will now face significantly increased enforcement.  Nothing causes the police to show up faster then when you're cutting into government profits."
"Because the rotation is so young, I think Black has tried very hard to keep Chatwood in the rotation for a little bit of (somewhat) veteran experience.  But with the splits he has they should have traded him.  He simply can't keep pitching at Coors Field, which means they will have to trade him at some point.  He might well become a solid 3 or 4 pitcher in some rotation, but it will not be here."
"""Right of way"" doesn't mean much when you're dead. If I dress up in black and go jaywalk across the freeway at 3AM, sure, I technically have the right of way. But it would be pretty naive to deny that my own behavior contributed to my death when I'm inevitably hit by a driver, drunk or sober.

RIP to the woman killed, and hopefully this guy can move on with his life and be a productive member of society."
"His KKKampaign manager will unravel whatever gains Trump makes, if any.  

I find it interesting that the press pants after Trump for visiting one black church.  Let's see him visit 50.  But he won't because that doesn't get him the free coverage that this lone event does."
"APPEARS HE USED NOT ONE CENT OF HIS WINDFALL FROM THE STATE WHEN HE SUED FOR SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHERE THEY HAD HID HIM FROM PUBLIC VIEW IN A STATE JOB,  WHEN IT WAS DISCOVERED HE WAS HIRED BY RENTON CITY COUNCILMAN ED PRINCE TO BE HIS OFFICE MINION ON THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMISSION WHERE HE COLLECTED A PAY CHECK FOR A YEAR DOING NOTHING, EXCEPT RUN AROUND ON ED'S CAMPAIGN FOR THE CITY COUNCIL ,  AND THEY THREW HIM A $60k BONE TO GO AWAY.......AUBURN LET HIM ON THE PARKS BOARD, WHAT NUMSKULLS ........MOVED TO AUBURN, WHERE HE IS FOSTERING ANOTHER RUN AT SOME NEW AND WILD RESUME OF INFLATED DO NOTHING , I AM SURE....."
"Again B/S. Most German soldiers fought for the motherland. The majority didn't care about exterminating Jews. Just because most southern soldiers didn't own slaves mean nothing. Official gov't policy of the south was that they were fighting to preserve slavery. Every southern soldier knew this, just as every German soldier knew that Nazi policy was the extermination of Jews.
 Tired of hearing about the tyranny the north was putting on the south. Read the writings of Jefferson Davis and he states the reason for session is to protect the Souths "" RIGHTS"" to treat black people as a commodity to be owned and traded and treated as an owner saw fit. Also without slaves the GNP of the south would be extremely lowered, since the large plantations would have to pay to have the agriculture crops worked. Since the souths Gnp was all most entirely agriculture it could not survive as a country without slaves. Your whole argument is revisionist history. Do a little reading"
"The ""Reverend Mark"" was just busted.  He's the ""member of the black clergy"" who is/was a tTrump surrogate who blackfaced Hillary in his ad.   Seems he didn't have a bachelor's degree after all.  Nor was his military service truthful.  Gee, and Who Shalt Not Lie?  Or Bear False Witness?"
"A interesting article of a vast topic. I found this to be most concerning:
""Mr. Fillon was, until recently, regarded as the best hope to defeat Marine Le Pen, the extreme-right candidate who is politically and financially backed by, and is highly supportive of, Mr. Putin.""
Putin has access to tap into the profit generated by Russia's vast wealth. He has utilized enormous funds to buy the influence of western political leaders. In doing so, he has become the wealthiest person in the world has made the politicians he influences rich as well. He has been doing this for years as it is a long term strategy. The most recent story that seems to be dying out was his interference in the American political campaign. He is going after the Ukraine to solidify an age old Russian problem of its' border on the Black Sea. He and Trump want to end the problem of jihadist extremism.
To add, the European refugee crisis of 2015 contributed to these political conditions favourable to Putin and his money."
"If Trump never brought it up and made a unilateral decision that he didn't even consult with his top Generals about (not just ""his generals"" whomever that might have been....General Motors?  Maybe he talked to his car.), then this would not be in the news and transgendered people would fade into the background, serving alongside other men and women.  Think about 70 years ago....after Truman integrated the military, what if suddenly the next president said, ""No, black people can't serve in the same units anymore.""  Do you even think there wouldn't be attention drawn to that issue?

I think you're right - people should keep their private lives to themselves.  However, this ""president"" messed the situation up.  He's the guy who LOVES drawing attention to himself, remember?"
"I was in an Indian Casino in Oklahoma which had a huge $5 buffet.   I paid my five bucks and, being such a self-disciplined soul, only selected a few items which really appealed to me.  My point? I'm one of those ""older folks"" and I look back at the ""good old days"" like I looked at the buffet.  Sure, there were good things about the late '40s and '50s when I ""grew up.""  We kids could walk to the park and play baseball, kickball or whatever till dark and then walk home w/o worrying about being kidnapped, assaulted or whatever.  Working class employees made a ""living"" wage...my Dad was a teamster and we lived a solid ""lower middle class"" life...even bought a TV in 1949 (Dumont..and got two channels.. one from San Diego..one from LA).  On the flip-side..racial and ethnic prejudice were still ""part of life""...Blacks, to most, were ""N##@"" and Hispanics were ""wetbacks"" or ""beaners""... nothing is simple...some things have gotten ""better""...great.  Some things have gotten ""worse""...not great."
I object to young Canadian indigenous people appropriating black American hip-hop culture.
"I think we simplify why people cling to religious identity. In Africa, the ones who didn't have a strong religious identity were converted by the European colonizers. The Muslim population stuck to religion as an identity (nationalism came in much later, and is an amorphous concept). 

The ones who stick to their religion don't integrate, or more importantly get a modern education. That begins a vicious circle of social immobility, and sticking to religion. However, looking down on someone's religion does not make them less religious. Accepting them does. India, for instance, allows religious laws to apply for marriage and inheritance, if a Muslim chooses to (there are civil laws, which apply according to ones choice). 

Along with the vote, that is a large reason that ISIS has more members from most western countries, despite India having 180 million Muslims (France has 5 million Muslims, and over 1000 members in ISIS, India has 60; Canada has over 100, USA has over 300)."
"As a Black American I can firmly see that liberal Democrats and their minions are taking direct aim at the true target of their quest to erase their questionable history, the American Civil War.

With the American Civil War on our historical books people will and are beginning to ask a lot of questions that will identify the true past of the Democratic Party. Why did we have the war? Who was on what side? Was slavery an issue? What political party established a vigilante group and voted for the Jim Crow laws to instill the southern way of life that was vanquished and force its will on the Republicans and later the freed slaves? What was the Chicago Platform? What party did Abraham Lincoln belong to? Why did Booth shoot Lincoln? Questions that arise from this war all point to an era the Democrats want to hide.

The Democratic Party, founded by Andrew ""Trail of Tears"" Jackson, wants everyone to think that their party pioneered civil rights and emerged in the 1960's.
 
They did not."
"Golly, the article asks if there is anything to celebrate for BHM, and then the following gets censored:

I'll be in Tranna in July. Make sure that BLM posts what I can do or where I can go, and I'll be sure to submit to their will.""

For this reason, I see it as a false solution. -- Yes, the Little Bookcliffs have excellent natural barriers and this area would lend itself so well to Reserve Design to assure genetically long-term viable, ecologically well adapted, and naturally self-stabilizing populations, or herds, of mustangs without coating their most intimate sexual organs with chemicals derived from ground-up pigs ovaries, which on the face of it should send up some mighty red flags, especially to biologists who understand physiology. You can read about my Reserve Design proposal at www.gofundme.com/mstngreservedesign. I have presented this to the BLM on several occasions. It is the right way forth for all concerned."
"I think you are missing the point.  In your zeal to argue about median salaries and accuse everyone of being a liar you have derailed the conversation.  I am not suggesting that a HS kid is going to make $75K fresh out of high school.  I am suggesting that there is a very clear and direct path from starting in tech to a generally high paying family wage job that is well about the local median wage.    

These skills, if learned, are highly transferrable and can set our children on a path that opens up opportunities for them.  As for giving you a break, I, for one, am not going to give it.  Exposing children to code at a young age and demystifying the 'black magic' that happens behind the scenes is key.  Getting children to begin to think logically at a younger age is, in my opinion, a good thing.  Giving them a foundation to build on is the key."
"I agree with Paul Racher however it's not a simple task ahead.  The Canadian government may have gotten the land cheap and not fulfilled its agreed payment but at the same time if the land hadn't been taken over it would be worth only a fraction of what it is now.  Without the change in land usage, Canada would have remained in value like many African or South American countries and we would most likely be being exploited by US, Russia & China.  How do we reconcile two very opposite understandings of land ownership?  I would like nothing more than to find a compromise that fits both First Nations needs and those of other Canadians but I don't see that happening right now. Breaking Canada back into dozens of individual self governing nations doesn't seem to be a viable way forward since we lose the strength of being one united large country. Plus many people are currently saying no because they want finality not ongoing payments and recriminations forever."
"I hope you surf national media outlets, Russel, because most political pendants believe that tRump can't possibly win without, especially, the blacks and Hispanic populations.  I'm hoping that a greater number of ethnic and organizational coalitions ban together and stop tRump at the voting booths.  I made several social-political predictions and they've all come true just the way I thought that they would:  US Supreme Court majority on same-sex marriage and allowing the Affordable Care Act.  Sometimes national domestic policy has to get bad before it gets better.  We had it bad under Bush and Chaney.  Whether people like it or not, President Obama DID make some socio-economic changes for the better of our country."

"Noooooo, Black.  You work too much overtime hammering against Alaska Natives.  When was the last time you attended an Alaska Federation of Natives (AFN) convention to witness all the healthy Native families attending a convention to protect their rights?  When was the last time you attended Alaska Native Arctic Olympics and watched healthy young men and women compete in sports?  When was the last time you attended a Region 3A or 4A high school basketball state tournament and watch healthy high school kids compete in championship games?  When was the first time and last time you sat in an all Native audience and watched and listened to healthy Alaska Natives represent their villages and traditional cultures?  When was the last time you sang, drummed, and danced to Alaska Native traditions?  When was the last time you stood on the banks of a village and help haul in a whale or seals to feed the villagers.  When, when, when?"
"Ms Black: I'm not an attorney, but I did sleep in a Holiday Inn last night.

As I stated, the more you study this issue the clearer it is that the proposed measure is unconstitutional.  ORS 230.035 is very clear..Read especially sub. 4: which reads “Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the rights of the electors of a county to propose county ordinances through exercise of the initiative power. [1973 c.282 §2; 1981 c.140 §1; 1985 c.756 §1; 1995 c.712 § 87; 2007 c.155 §12]”  It simply couldn't be clearer.  

The Initiatives you reference have already passed the ""single subject"" review and been approved for signature gathering.  That is not the issue involved with the proposed measure.  The Commissioners who support this proposal wish to grant themselves the power to prevent the Initiative process if they feel a proposal doesn't meet their definition of ""county concern."" This is precisely what ORS 230.035 sub. 4 prohibits.

"Race, sexual orientation, psychosis are all different issues.  To compare and contrast race (ethnicity) w/ sexual orientation is a strawman argument.  You can't choose to be black.

It could be financial, it could be criminal record, it could be affiliations w/ known orgs that hate america...not liking a hiring policy?...there are processes to change it.  This venue is not one of them.  Congress employs, Exec deploys, then checks w/ Congress before 90 days or so, so that the check and the balance is daijobu.

Softly softly, speak nicely don't upset the ugly gorilla and how has that helped getting decency from the gorilla? Also your account of Kennedy's verbal interactions with his generals is 'Liberal' hearsay, how much is actually the full truth?  I read a French account by an ex diplomat (forget his name and the book) involved in the Cuban crisis and his firm opinion was that Kennedy and the US, who played draughts while the Russians played chess, were very much out negotiated. Two big concessions the Russians got was (secret) removal of US missiles from Turkey and an agreement to never invade Cuba. The latter was crucial as it allowed the Russians to fund/send Cuban military and political activists all over the 2nd/3rd world without the US being able to do anything to stop it."
"Sanger, along with W.E.B. DuBois, just wanted to sterilize as many young black women as possible.  

The Harlem Birth Control Clinic was first, then the ABCL and then The Negro Project.  

 ""In it she argued that birth control clinics, or bureaus, should be established “in which men and women will be taught the science of parenthood and the science of breeding.” For this was the way “to breed out of the race the scourges of transmissible disease, mental defect, poverty, lawlessness, crime ... since these classes would be decreasing in number instead of breeding like weeds."""
"Commendable. I agree with his feelings. For me this is someone who is quietly making a statement and he is sticking up for his race. He is not using the BLM as an excuse to riot and disrespect law enforcement. He is quietly taking a personal stand and I find his reasons to be commended. As a country we have an epidemic of LEO using excessive force and killing black Americans. There are good cops & bad cops. It's scary when someone with a weapon & a badge is being excessively physically aggressive because they are always ""right"". It seems like cops can say outrageous things and people will automatically believe them. It is a very helpless reality. Should he stand and pledge to a country that has an admitted history of prejudice and racial hate crimes? Should he pledge because he is a NFL player and not in the ghetto? How is this different from Rosa Parks? Martin Luther King?  It doesn't mean he isn't a patriot.

The CBC's top-of-the-page stories now are on wild foxes in Newfoundland and a push in Hamilton for better transit.

The UK attack is item number 7 in the list as you eye down from the top of the page.

Do you think the CBC would have had that kind of low prioritization if this had been in the USA with a murderous American right-wing militia group and with dozens of black folks as the victimized casualties?

The CBC's coverage was certainly prominent on events such as Trayvon Martin (Florida) and Michael Brown (Ferguson). Indeed, you can read Ferguson headlines in depth even days and months after the event at the CBC, such as ""Michael Brown shooting commemorated 1 year on"" and ""Michael Brown shooting and Ferguson aftermath timeline"" and ""Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson speaks about Michael Brown shooting"".

Canada's media does not under-report US gun events, they simply choose ones that fit a wanted narrative."

"I agree with Marissa Kerns on her take on the state's AJA community.  They do have a cronyistic setup, for sure.

Like blacks on the mainland, AJAs vote monolithicly, like about 90%, for Dems.  I don't think they do any research on who they vote for.  As long as the candidate has D behind his/her name, they vote accordingly.

Of course, the Republicans also are to blame as they don't have many candidates to offer.

"It has nothing to do with race and everything to do with CLASS. The war on drugs unfairly targets the POOR.  The fact that racial minorities in both the USA (Latinos and African Americans) and in Canada (First Nations) are dis proportionally affected by these policies is because they make up a larger percentage of the ""poor"" demographic than they do the general population. The result is that their racial group is being more affected by policies that unfairly target the poor.

Now this doesn't account for sentencing, plea bargains, etc where there is definitely systemic racism involved.

Address the issue of poverty and why racial minorities are disproportionately represented in the poor demographic and you will solve many other ""race"" issues in the process"

"Look at how Ramaphosa's Shanduka black umbrellas is empowering and helping black people. It's Real BEE. Look at the kids he pays for through his Education trust. There is no building ourselves as black people without education and progressive action. 

You can spin it all you want but real facts are Ramaphosa was a non-executive director of Lonmin, probably attending 3/4 board meetings a year and far from involved in the running of Lonmin. When people started dying, he used whatever influence he could to intervene and HELP, hence asking the police to do their job and stop the criminals. How on earth is it his fault that the cops went out and murdered people in cold blood. 

Communism needs 2 fundamental ingredients. A Homogenous group with similar interests and uncorruptible, skilled and moral leaders. It's impossible for SA to be homogenous, we are all too different. From Zille to Zuma and even the very Ramaphosa I'm defending, theses leaders are far from fit to run all our lives."
"Maybe so.  I am not saying the residential school payments are necesssarily wrong.  But First Nations people already enjoy many advantages -- no tax if you live on a reserve, up to 35k/yr for university, 42K per capita in transfer payments to Nunavut in 2016.

By contrast, my grandfather lived through the war and while his family was evacuated to the country where there was a  thriving black market, all his kids had running sores by war's end due to malnutrition.  He was only allowed to enter Canada with his 9 children by signing on as a farm hand for a year.  The pay was a tiny house, $50/month, and all the milk his family could drink..  The kids were teased for their clothes and accents.

But he wasn't bitter about it, nor did he think anyone owed him anything.  When his stint as a farm hand ended, he bought a tiny farm and worked it happily til he died.  Each of his children went on to raise happy families of their own.

He got kicked hard but got up again -- with no handouts."

"You are actually preaching to the choir here, so I have no idea what you are attempting to polarize here. My statement is not an argument for or against any stated position. Just as Corporations are ""individuals,"" I am simply stating that under the law Gays and African Americans (as an example of a race) are both legally equivalent classes or races of people. Therefore, mere sexual preference with regard to discrimination in the workplace is the same as discrimination against race or religious affiliations. I disagree with this idea because there is no proof that people are born gay as a black person is born black. BTW, region is NOT a protected class. Religious freedom is a protected activity under the constitution. You can worship whatever religion you want. I have no position on religious denominations rejecting individuals or groups based on race or sexual identity. I only know God loves everyone-I would like to think equally.

What are the ways that practices can be modified to achieve equality and be in conformance with Gospel ideals of inclusiveness and service? That is holiness worth striving for."

I don't twitter.  I resent the implication from these groups that anyone who hasn't lived their struggle are privileged.  They are looking everywhere for umbrage, inventing it to suit their own purposes.  The university profs and media who buy into this line of 'reasoning',  are helping them to manufacture it.   
I fail to see any reason why I should feel guilty for lifting myself out of childhood poverty, nor should we need to abase ourselves before these groups, many of them with four year university degrees, who feel themselves aggrieved."

The BLM rally I attended was peaceful, charitable and constructive.  The speakers talked about how all lives matter, how black families need to be strong, and how we need to respect the police.  I have been thinking lately about how negative stereotypes develop because we get our information from the news media, not from actually engaging with one another in our own communities.
Don't forget the civil rights movement in the 1960's was not always as nice and pretty as it is now portrayed.  Dr. King was clear that people will change not because they are so nice, but because their way of life and economic privileges become disrupted and this was the intent of the movement.  Dignity and justice have always involved some degree of disruption, hopefully the peaceful kind."

The ""highest response"" possible is for all 200 bishops plus in the US heading up all those dioceses to immediately and publicly condemn the recent horrific comments and behavior of the president and the behavior of the anti Semitic, anti black, anti just about everything protesters.

And immediately these bishops in all these 195 dioceses should instruct the clergy in these dioceses to address these issues with the faithful and evoke appropriate response....

By conflating the chaotic mass migration of single men from Africa and the Near and Middle East into Europe with the carefully vetted selection of immigrants and refugees (largely families) assisted by an effective settlement network in Canada to assist the newcomers adjust to their new country, Canada, you do yourself and readers of your comment a great disservice.

There is no indication that this latest wave of new Canadians will be more problematic or, over time, not make their own significant positive contribution to Canadian society.  Your negative reaction mirrors the reactions of other past reactionaries to Irish, Eastern European, Jewish, Asian, etc. earlier waves of immigrants.

"Daniel Moynihan's report on the African American family was released in 1965. ""Out of wedlock"" births for this group were already at 25% and single-parent households had been rising gradually since 1880.  So these roots go back some time. Historically, African Americans have also lived in extended family structures with more frequency that other cultures, and single mothers tend to be connected in one way or another to those structures. There are other issues, of course--loads of them.

The Constitution once said slavery was O.K., and that was changed without destroying the Republic.  The Constitution once said only male land-owners could vote. That was changed, and still the Republic stands.  The Constitution was once amended to prohibit the manufacture, sale or transportation of intoxicating beverages, then amended back again, and STILL the Country did not descend into anarchy and moral turpitude.

Did they not steal land and people in their pursuit of goods?   Was the Algonquin nation not formed in order to protect itself against the Iroquoian nation?   

You cannot live in the past forever and the world is getting more populated as is the FN population.  What we are doing now is insane and needs to stop."
"McCoy should understand Hawaii history before he uses the race card. Blacks were brought over to worked in the cotton fields. Chinese, Japanese, Filipino, Portuguese workers were brought to Hawaii to work in the cane fields and pineapple fields. Same boat, so don't cry about having it hard, people in Hawaii don't want to hear it."
"""The mosque was the place where my fellow committee members, Sabreena, Fatima and Shazia, explained to the mosque board how important it was for us to march in the Regina Pride Parade in support of our LGBTQ community""

This is a little reminiscent of a time in the 60's in USA when the Jewish community recognized the plight of the black community and supported them.
Obviously I don't know the outcome of the discussion described above but that this conversation is taking place for support of a group that has previously been prejudiced against is a positive sign."

"Smoke doesn't have to be black to be deadly.

Anti-smoking laws are pretty ridiculous considering ay car emits more toxic exhaust than a room full of smokers.

Lock yourself in a garage with 20 smokers, and you'll smell bad.

But we keep making nonsensical laws, and not address real issues. Because it's easy."

"Once again the AP leaves out the fact that those Russian ads also promoted Hillary, Black Lives Matter, and African American's rights.

Even the liberal WaPo had to grudgingly admit that three days ago-
""The batch of more than 3,000 Russian-bought ads that Facebook is preparing to turn over to Congress shows a deep understanding of social divides in American society, with some ads promoting African American rights groups, including Black Lives Matter, and others suggesting that these same groups pose a rising political threat, say people familiar with the covert influence campaign. The Russian campaign — taking advantage of Facebook’s ability to send contrary messages to different groups of users based on their political and demographic characteristics — also sought to sow discord among religious groups. Other ads highlighted support for Democrat Hillary Clinton among Muslim women.""

The big Trump ""scandal"" has now been downgraded to the new lie ""Russian ads may have helped Trump""."
"The dangerous fiction is being propagated by those who call objections to some aspects of a religion, ""racism against brown people"".

Islam is a religion, not a race. Muslims come in all colors, as do Christians.

So unless that young woman identifies herself as a practicing member of the religion by wearing an outward sign of it, she will not be identified as one."
"I'm a legal immigrant, and a citizen. The most prominent outcome of this election, and that of the prior two before this present one, is that in the prior two all was quiet on the streets of the USA with no crybabies protesting, no one kneeling at the Anthem, no broken windows or fire bombs into the doorways of the self employed, no crybabies on campuses needing therapy dog visits, no grade schools being let out so the little children can protest the new ""duly elected president"".
No, the last elections were quiet though nearly as many were all too aware of Obama's failures at getting us out of war, at closing down coal mining communities, and leaving them financially high, and dry yet at the very same time handing out financial aid to illegal immigrants and refugees, he nearly let the VA become a thing of the passed, and in plain words, abandoned the inner cit, black ghetto. Need I say more? 
Grow up, and cut with the crying. Give this Trump fellow a chance. We gave Obama 8 years!"

- We also heard she was enthused by how much better Singapore had made out of an even worse situation, wanting to gain from that example. But she's fundamentally a poor politician! This is no way to satisfy the local majority gimme-gimme, I'm entitled, regime. It dreadfully denies their entitled victimhood. Given this victimhood (I'm entitled! Don't have to earn anything! Can be as criminal as I like!) attitude, even among the political opposition, there's no hope for a decent future for this country. No hope at all."

"The columnist very much overstates the case for there being any features or choices of Trump that have somehow impacted China's trajectory in any major way.

China assertively looks out for its own interests on the world stage, as it has done for decades, centuries, millennia.

China's momentum and direction would be no different with a USA under a Hillary or a Bernie over the past twelve months. That is a blink of an eye in the landscape of China's motion.

One of my favourite quotes, ever, came from Mao Zedong, paraphrased here: ""Things always seem at their darkest right before everything becomes completely black.""

That is an excellent quote, regardless of your political persuasion..."
"Feel free to peruse my several posts containing Exact Trump Quotes that clearly reflect the fact that he is a racist and bigot. But aside from direct quotes, there's plenty of evidence to point to the fact he's racist, from the fact the he refused to rent to blacks in the 70's to his rants about Mexican and Muslim judges today.  The fact that he has consistently denigrated women in word and deed cannot be denied by any truthful person. Nor can the fact that he dislikes gays, made fun of a disabled man ( captured on video) and done and said countless other disgusting things.  

If you "" do not see where he has ever made any direct statements "" such as I and literally, everyone on the internet, who owns a television, tweets, reads and/or ownsany kind of media device whatsoever, then you are in true denial, the kind where a woman starving to death from anorexia sees a fat person in the mirror."
"Nope, but you have no examples of me being racist. Absolutely none. Unless, of course, you choose to redefine racism to support an agenda of some sorts. 

It's hard to talk to kids about things like skin color and societal expectations. Many black kids are taught through the soft racism of lower expectations that they need help to make things better.  It's even harder when they hear that dad is a racist or that anyone who doesn't vote a certain way is a racist, or heartless or whatever. Teaching kids to think beyond skin color is a daily task when people like you throw labels around so casually. 

I used to post under my real name but gave that up because of this right here. I feel that being anonymous is lame and allows such behavior but I didn't want my family to suffer for my ideas shared here."
"I am a 75 year old product of the ""old Toronto"" (largely Protestant Christians) whose grandmother was discriminated against when she arrived in Canada in 1908 (by signs in stores advertising sales vacancies but stating ""no Irish need apply""). Yet, my grandmother was also a member of the Orange Lodge, which discriminated against Roman Catholics.

Until I entered U of T, I had never talked to a jew or a black. When I did, I found them acceptable as friends. In 1968, while interviewing job applicants, I met my first Sikh. I had to mentally talk to my self to concentrate on his words and not on his appearance. He turned out to be a fabulous employee. In time, my department expanded to include both a muslim and a Chinese Canadian woman - all of which added to its strength.   

I have become used to muslim women wearing the hijab. But, I still am uncomfortable with the niqab. Why? I suspect because I have not yet had a meaningful personal interaction.

Time is the answer; not a ban."

"I say it is time to open it up.  Open up the documents in the Vatican library and let us see them online.

We need to know how gold was acquired.  We need to know how land was acquired.  How were other churches, such as in England, subsumed to Rome.

"I understand that Sr. Christine needs to have hope that Francis is improving the situation of women in the Church.  Unfortunately, the facts contradict her position.  As long as women are kept out of the priesthood, we will not be fully equal in the Church.  And as long as the clerical culture is maintained, the Church will suffer.  Francis has done nothing to enable the ordination of women or to dismantle the clerical structure and culture in the Catholic Church.  
Telling women to wait and be patient is no different from what those opposed to dismantling segregation loved telling African Americans -- just be patient, and your time will come ....."
"The same mindset led to the shameful internment of Japanese Americans in WWII.  To signs in Alaska that read ""No dogs, no Natives"".  To the signs that read, ""No Irish need apply"".

"More evidence that Trump is, in his heart of hearts, a con man. 

He looked right into the cameras and lied, and he shamelessly rode the birther whisper campaign and fed the delusions of those who refused to accept the legitimacy of the nation's first black president.

"What a politician, like Lincoln, ""really thinks/believes"" is often a conclusion of his opponents and his adherents with their own agendas long after the demise of the politician.

I prefer contemporaneous documentation of the time over vague assertions about what modern-day people of any persuasion want to be the truth.

The Pentagon Papers, the Nixon tapes, the Snowden WikiLeaks of our more modern times clearly demonstrate that lies, obfuscation and deception are the tools of politicians of every political persuasion.  

I read an interesting book about Lincoln where it was pointed out that he co-opted and de-fanged several of his Presidential opponents by putting them in his cabinet and the Supreme Court.  He was a consummate politician.

The Lincoln debate quote I gave was made one year before Oregon was admitted to the Union with its prohibition against both slavery and the presence of black people.   The times and the politics were grossly different."
"The Rockies are a good team. I just don't know if they're a playoff team. They peaked in June. They ran into the Dodgers at exactly the right time on the last road trip, which may have made them look better than they currently are. The Rockies' biggest weakness all year has been their offense--something camouflaged at times at Coors Field, but always apparent. Bud Black seems to be out of ideas. I get that no one expected them to make the playoffs THIS year, but you can't assume they'll be better next year either--will Holland be here? Or Cargo? What about Lucroy and Neshek? Can you count on Charlie Blackmon and Nolan Arenado bailing you out every other night? I still say the Rockies need 87 wins to make the Wildcard, but boy, they are making me doubt they'll ever get there."

The irony of mocking someone who left ""your"" school because other students were bullying and mocking them, is amazing.  It was different from Donald's comments since they didn't boast of commiting sexual assault.  

Yes, ""faculty room"" talk, based on my experience, is ""black humor"".....let's laugh instead of crying..type humor.  Doing the same ""in public"" would be a far different story.

"Regardless of the polls, it is all about the economy. Period. People are working and anyone who wants a job can get one. For the NDP to suggest that if elected they will shut down the twinning of the pipeline, it is the same as saying no to jobs.

"The photo was taken by a back stabber who had been invited to Shurtz's home.  Instead of politely suggesting to Shurtz that they did not like the black makeup and indicating that in their PC minds it was racist, they betrayed Shurtz's kindness in inviting them and threw her under a bus."
"This is an apology written by someone with extensive legal training. What is still incongruous about this statement (as was the initial statement) is her seeming perplexed by the hurt caused by her blackface at a Halloween party.  

This professor is well-educated and has lived and worked for decades at the UO, a liberal university with visible activism by students and faculty. And she is trying to convince us now that she was making a statement about race and provoke a conversation about racism by wearing blackface at a Halloween party, but also says that her action ""provoked a discussion of racism, but not as I intended"". That's simply not believable. 

Think of this in another way. If men wanted to have a serious discussion about sexism, would it be ok to show graphic pornographic images of women to women and say, ""This is an example of sexism by men""? The answer is an obvious ""no"" because it's offensive, and because there are other ways to have a real discussion about that issue."

"How are you defining ""human existence?""  The remains of homo sapiens were recently discovered in North Africa that are 300,000 years old, 100,00 years older than previously known.  Our Pre-homo sapien ancestors go back 7.2 million years, per remains found in the Balkans.  Do they count?

The natural forces that affect climate change precede man.  The AGW theorists can't explain why we've had periods of ""global warming"" followed by increases in CO2 (to levels as high as 10,000 ppm) between each of the Ice Ages, long before man could have had anything to do with it.  During the time of the dinosaurs and other very large creatures, the Earth was covered with plant life growing prolifically during very high levels of CO2.  The Earth was a more accommodating place for life then than it is now.  Up to ten degrees warmer, too.

If we can't understand why it warmed back then under current AGW theory, why shoud be believe the theory applies now?"
"When a question was posted to Black a while back about the future of the rotation...I think he said something like ""these things have a way of working themselves out with performances""....Right now, I would assume Hoffman might be the guy being sent down upon Grays return based on the current body of work from the 4 rookies. It's a shame, as it appeared he might have turned the corner but Marquez was able to limit the damage on Tuesday whereas Hoffman did not last night."
"Mote.  Beam.  You proceed according to the ""perception"" that a single pregame interview sums up this man's life, without any substantiation whatsoever.  Since I never watch TV except when it's beamed at me in airport lobbies, I have no opinion concerning said interview, but have seen too many such interviews of myself, family and friends chopped, spliced and rearranged such that the final footage made us appear to have said the exact opposite of what we actually said.  Reason my Iraqi brother-in-law stopped giving interviews at the start of ""Operation Devil's Storm"".

Having said that, what's fairly safe to conclude--whatever your claimed or real ""identity""--is that you don't feel vulnerable to the types of threats to which me and mine, and black American athletes, ARE vulnerable.  Do I find your identity ""interesting""?  Nah.  Irrelevant.  That's because I'm not a 'racist', in case you haven't figured that out."

"So far it is actually Obama's State Department Inspector General who says Hillary had no permission and was wrong to set up this system.  

The FBI (last report in excess of 125 Special Agents) under Obama's Attorney General Lynch  is the one conducting the other investigation and who have given 5th Amendment  immunity from prosecution to the Hillary staffer who set up the system while employed by both her  and the State Department at the same time.  
 
You have to remember that the civil suit under the FOIA by Judicial Watch where the Federal Judge (appointed by Bill Clinton in 1994) wants to delve into that 5th Amendment immunity and Hillary's e-mails is totally separate from what the FBI is doing.   

He is the same Federal Judge who is assigned to the  case where the IRS 'lost' all those e-mails regarding conservative organizations.

In case you are curious, he also happens to be African-American."
"Hadiya Roderique, thank you for sharing your experience as a human being, a Canadian, a woman of colour. Throughout our lives I suppose many (most) of us feel we don't belong for any number of reasons. Your essay reinforces that it's naive for me to judge what your life is like - in the whole - by looking at your resume, a photograph, meeting you in a particular setting, knowing your family. As it would be naive of you to judge me. I'm sure I've made many missteps over the years, but strive to learn more every day on this planet. The tone of many of the comments here leaves me sad for humanity ... yet many readers connected strongly with your essay so I am also hopeful that honest conversation can provoke us to move forward."
Trump is exactly the president America needs today. With our country being taken over by illegal aliens and cities protecting the criminal aliens we need a tough man in charge. Not a softy like the last 8 years. Now we have Seattle trying to enable the heroin epidemic with safe injection sites. Can you see anything good coming out of this? The goal of the city should be to get people off the drugs not make it easier to stay on them. I'm hoping the Feds put a stop to this along with the sanctuary cities and illegal pot sales. We now have a president that wants to follow the laws of our country.
"When Lyles came in to start the 8th, and EVERY Rockies fan on the planet was at the very LEAST ""puckering up"" a bit, and at the very most, throwing a brick through their TV set, Goodman said that Black REALLY wanted to stay away from Holland today, because he had pitched a LOT earlier in the week. His velocity was down in his last game, and even though he had yesterday off, he'd thrown over twenty pitches in each of the last two games before that, compounded by the little bit of bad luck on the timing, because he brought him in in a NON-save opportunity for only the 3rd time on Wednesday, because he hadn't been getting ENOUGH work. So it sounds like Black made it clear that that he was REALLY hoping to stay away from him today, knowing that if he COULD get through today w/out using him, w/the off day tomorrow, he'll end up w/three full days of rest if we need him to go on Tuesday."
Congratulations Mr. Campbell.  A teaching job well done.  Thank you for inspiring your students and giving their parents hope.  Thank you for giving public schools and ASD critics a black eye.
"I recall when Bush was seen as too slow off the mark during Katrina and New Orleans native and once DNC chair Donna Brazile (the one who later leaked debate questions to Hillary before her 2nd debate with Trump) went ballistic castigating Bush for every conceivable and inconceivable problem connected with the relief and reconstruction of New Orleans.

The usual left wing suspects were happy to pile on.  Some like Puff Daddy went so far as to accuse Bush of racism and not caring about New Orleans because it was majority black.  (How Puff Daddy squared this with Bush's billions in aid for Africa was never revealed.)

Years later, after Bush was out of office and Obama was in office, Donna Brazile apologized profusely to W. saying nobody was a stronger and more generous supporter of the reconstruction of New Orleans than George W. who ""kept every promise he made to us"".

Brazile, you see, already had her political advantage from Katrina so it was now OK to actually tell the truth."
"I absolutely agree there is prejudice and injustice in our world and country today.  But if someone feels her costume was a way for her to truly come out and show she is a raciest, prejudice person, or wanted to portray a suppressive message to African Americans, they probably couldn’t be more wrong.  I suggest they look into the mirror and not pre-judge her either, or not fail prey to the knee jerk reaction of the uninformed and/or court of public option to quickly race to jury and judgment, based on a news headline.
 Bottom line, she was inspired by the book and its author.  She, just like the Author, was “standing up for”, and bringing to light the same injustice many others are fighting for (and she has for years, and I'm sure she has felt some as a woman lawyer also).  It would be more than a shame, if she loses her job unjustly, because some are un-informed, didn’t understand, (or didn’t care to understand her message/intent) and their blind intolerance."
"Richard,
To address the issue of disproportionate police shootings of African Americans, shouldn't one also address the issue that African Americans' criminal activity rate is far disproportionate to their representation overall in our population? To bemoan the former but forget the latter (which would certainly skew the former's statistical impact) seems rather imprudent. Perhaps both should be equally scrutinized and addressed to improve our national condition.

Another interesting statistic...roughly 95% of those suspects in which lethal force was used by police were armed.  How would you propose our ""amateurish and trigger-happy police"" (another fallacy not supported factually given the number of police contacts annually versus their use of lethal force in those contacts) respond? Do you also have any peer reviewed statistics to support your assertion that lethal force is utilized systemically by the police against POC in circumstances that they would not do the same to Caucasians?"
"Didn't the Virginia shooter live in Indiana?  They don't have real strict gun control laws, not compared to many other states."
"This relatively ""new phenomenon"" where NFL players throughout the country (and some others) chose to ""kneel"" and perhaps ""bow their heads"" during the National Anthem could be a questionable expression of their ""displeasure"" to ""contempt"" for the United States and its Anthem.....and perhaps President Trump.
-
And  it could be that some joined the ""knelling"" to also express their reverence for a much Higher Power (God) since ""kneeling and bowing one's head"" is a ""traditional"" way of showing such reverence to God.
-
Think of the irony if Blacks, Southern Confederates, the Religious Right, and others all - all - become ""united"" in showing their ""displeasure"" of the United States.....for entirely different reasons."
"We gave it away a long time ago, Pitts.  It does nothing for your cause to argue it so disingenuously.

Terrorism, contrary to popular belief, didn't start on Sept. 11, 2001, nor did U.S. torture policies, which have been more or less with us since the beginning; from frontier ""justice,"" through our various wars, and finally packaged and exported through the School of the Americas(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Hemisphere_Institute_for_Security_Cooperation), to name one modern example.

What about the other 9/11, and CIA complicity in the Allende coup?  Black ops go back a long way, from regime change in Iran in the 50's to the dirty wars in Central and South America in the 70's and 80's, and elsewhere.  

You want to make a real case against torture, and terror?  Draw some real lines between cause and effect:  The world that U.S. policies of destabilization, terror, and military force have created, and the mess our children will be left to deal with."
"The company is going to start having an armed guard to watch for bears. This two young women were working out in the field when attacked and it sounds like the bear snuck up behind them. I have had a black bear do that to me twice and I was lucky both times to get to safety only because I happened to turn around and see him. Next to carrying a gun, bear spray is the best deterrent available. It is not always possible for people to carry rifles around while working. But you are right about bear guides carrying rifles. I went out to a bear viewing area where we had guides and they both had rifles. One walked in the front and the other at the back of the group. I can't imagine taking a group of tourists into bear country to view them without adequate protection!"
"We are quickly becoming a country where, if you feel that it is your opinion that is the correct one, any sort of action is justified.

This group, with signs emblazoned ""No Hate"" then justify expressing their hate, ""As long as they are right"".

Determining who has moral superiority is really a no-brainer.  Anyone automatically starts off with Moral Superiority when talking about Nazis or KKK.  The problem is, they also have a Right to Assemble and a Right to Freedom of Speech Expression - as long as it is done peacefully.

Any counter-protester has moral superiority - right up to the point where they start acting violently, no matter how justified they may think they feel.

The black man with the spray-can flamethrower at Charlottesville came prepared to do violence.  He initiated violence.  And, please spare me the ""shots fired"" or ""self-defense"" argument.  That doesn't pass a basic smell test - instead of running, you defend yourself with a handy spray-can you just happen to have."
"The Guardian hired an outside firm to analyze their comments section, and the results were unsurprising.  Articles by women and dark-skinned people got the most insults; articles by dark-skinned women topped the charts in this regard.  I see this every time one of Shemma Khan's excellent articles appears.  Often posters pay absolutely no attention to what she has written and simply pop off about Muslims.  It's like some sort of red alert goes out on twitter to wake the trolls."
"I have already answered your question above to Matt Blowers, in detail. 

Our church has already changed many of its rules and doctrines throughout the ages because they were wrong or unjust.  It will continue to do so because an unjust church that won't repent it sins, Christ will deny is his own.  

Sexism breaks Christ's Great Commandment and is a form of abusive hatred no less than racism.  Our church used to practice both of these evils for centuries.  Is that something you would have us do again because we used to own black men?  

Your comment is full of fear, misogyny, and much historic ignorance.  

You should try reading the Gospels more carefully.  You will never see Jesus treat women as less.  Jesus did not ordain anyone a priest.  The apostles were picked to be judges and they had to be Israelite Males due to lineage issues.  Our male clergy is no more suitable to fulfill the standard necessary to be an original apostle than any women today."
"This is what was once called the ""human interest"" story.  Whatever it's called now (by some: ""lefty sob-story"") the purpose remains the same: pluck the heart-strings and encourage sympathy for our own version of ""huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" All that's missing here is a reference to Canada as terminus for the fabled ""underground railroad."" However, no, there is no comparison possible to the mid-19th century phenomenon, during which an escapee--as they called him then--could earn his keep by mucking out barns and feeding the livestock. Another difference: it took  decades for 30,000-40,000 blacks to arrive here.  It took just one year (2008) for the same number of asylum-seekers to make their claim. 

We can't stop this.  

What we can do:
1. Quickly send them back--the cost will be less than to keep them here. 
2. Spread the word, Trump-style: i.e.: social media--""border-jumpers are sent back.""
3. Lower the annual refugee intake to compensate for these border-jumpers."
"Neither do the protestors.  BLM was predicated on a lie, and we get but a handful of brutality cases against blacks a year, but they always result in burning neighborhoods.

If anyone REALLY wants an eye-opening experience, they should google the video ""Activist critical of police undergoes use of force scenarios"" and PAY ATTENTION TO THE ACTIVIST'S RESPONSE AT THE END."
"Actually it appears there is. I recently saw a report on it and although I don't remember the specifics, in some places theres a booming black market for it"
"So, later today, the CEO of Intel quits the same panel, and he is not African American. No tweetstorm from trump. Gee, I wonder why."
"It seems to me the author is not absolutely factual throughout his piece. I do not believe he is exactly accurate about Muhammad Ali for example. We go on to read Michael Vick my be a wrongly convicted black man when most understand he was guilty and admittedly so. It is also apparent the writer is misinformed about dogs and dog breeds. And perhaps he does not understand that the pit fighting of dogs and chickens is illegal in the USA. Perhaps though we might consider allowing illegal immigrants to stage chicken fighting as part of their culture.

There are great benefits for those who compete in atheletics at all levels, and there are risks in almost every sport. More so in some than others."
"He admires Andrew Jackson, a slave owner, because Jackson mirrors Trumps views about African Americans. It's pretty clear what side Jackson, and Trump, would have been on in the Civil War."
"Computer software is not going to stop black market sales of pot by legal producers / retailers. The government is going to spend all their new tax revenue attempting to track production from seed to sale. If they want to use a high tech method require all producers to get their seed from a government lab and insert a genetic marker designated to each producer. Audit the crops to ensure no illicit pot is being grown with the crops. If any end user pot is found outside the legal system fine the producer or pull their licence.

Software is simply an accounting method that can be cheated, just look at the FDA's infallible quality control software that was used in India to ensure the proper handling of defective batches...one company was found to tamper with the software approximately 5700 times."
"Wrong.  Liberals want to damage the black market.  Taxation will be moderate in order to keep prices lower than the crappy weed being sold on he street. 
Barriers to entry:
- Licencing from Government
- Quality growing space
- Capital to purchase high-tech extraction equipment for oils and edibles - Big revenues for those that have this equipment (Aphria)
- Growing knowledge to produce specialized strains for specific uses and purposes."

"No, my implication is that LBJ was right when he said the War on Poverty would ""have those n....s voting Democrat for the next 200 years.""  Prior to 1965, most blacks voted Republican.  It was a brilliant political gambit.  Hispanics are much more likely than blacks to vote GOP -- Bush43 got 46% of the Hispanic vote -- but Trump's harsh rhetoric against illegals from Mexico reduced his percentage of the Hispanic vote to only about 26%.  A much lower % of Hispanics are on welfare, but most of them have friends, relatives, co-workers, and fellow church goers who are undocumented and don't want to see them deported.  I'm trying to convinced the GOP that if they treat the Hispanics fairly with Immigration Reform that gives the illegals legal status and way to stay, they'll get the majority of the Hispanic vote ""for the next 200 years"" and turn the demographic trend in their favor.  Hispanics tend to be family-oriented, religious, hard-working, and have large families, naturals for the GOP."

"Hi EN:  Sorry for delay in reply, but I have a job.  ;-)

I see that this is a real hot-button issue for you, so let me note up front that I'm not just out to 'stick a thumb in your eye'.  But I think you are seriously mistaken on a number of issues, and/or have a distorted perspective.

""... extractive industries are profitable only if ... clean-up costs ...  expense(d) to the general public ...""  Nonsense.

""... most older metal mines are now super-fund sites ...""   Some are.  Most aren't.  The total footprint on the environment in area terms for the U.S. is less than that for supermarket parking lots or airport runways.  The SF sites are local and limited; the benefits from the mining (i.e., 21st high technology, historically unprecedented standards of living and longevity) are widespread and general.  It's called a 'trade-off'.

""...  mercury residue left in the Bohemia district ...  poison ...""   This is the Black Butte mine?  As I understand it, indeed a Superfund ..."
"Do we have a local chapter of Black Lives Matter? And if so, why aren't they protesting the death of Precious Alex?"
"They're not ""rewriting"" history but putting one generations' interpretation of the past in the context of current knowledge. There is no one objective ""history"" just waiting to be written down by us. People produce histories according to their own needs out of the events of the past. 

How do you think black Southerners feel about statues erected to men who fought to maintain the enslavement of their ancestors? One highly doubts that they see these statues as ""ancestors who died defending their states from invaders."""
"You keep posting about this ""routine, unaccountable murder of young black men."" Other than black on black crime just where is this sort of behavior ""routine?"" just asking..."
"As I recall, Shakespeare cast only men in his plays. Even female roles were played by males. This was clearly part of the brutal history of misogyny in western culture. One further insult to women; denying them opportunity simply because of their gender. 

Men dressing in women's clothes, then, should represent the same taboo. 

Or, do you deny the atrocities men committed against women through history?"

 “What am I supposed to do if I don’t like him and I don’t trust her?” a millennial black woman in Ohio asked. “Choose between being stabbed and being shot? No way!”

“She was part of the whole problem that started sending blacks to jail,” a young black man, also from Ohio, observed about Mrs. Clinton.

“He’s a racist, and she is a liar, so really what’s the difference in choosing both or choosing neither?” another young black woman from Ohio said."
"""If Trump opposed racism, he would hardly be calling for the firing of black athletes who take a small symbolic step to protest racial violence against people of colour""
He did't. He said ""Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, to say, 'Get that SOB off the field right now, out, he's fired""
YOU'VE decided to make it about BLACK athletes. Add an extra word here, an extra word there - as long as it supports your narrative, right?"
Unlike the 1/3 black president that lurks in the shadows?
"“This not guilty verdict of a police officer who violently killed a citizen is another slap in the face to the black community in St. Louis. And a shot in the heart to the family of the victim,” Missouri State Rep. Michael Butler, D-St. Louis, said in a statement issued Friday morning, adding that the verdict has left him “appalled.”

Too bad Mr. Butler isn't appalled by the actions of the member of the black community who placed numerous citizens, residents and law enforcement officers in harms way.  Don't attack police officers with a deadly weapon (the car) while carrying another deadly weapon and you have virtually a 100% chance of surviving every encounter with law enforcement.  Pretty simple actually. Maybe Mr Butler's oratory ""skills"" could be put to better use employing the black community to be better members of their community instead of lawless thugs.  Nah, doesn't fit the victim narrative of the progressives . . ."
"I don't understand why so many black people don't have photo ID. Even if they don't drive, there must be other photo ID options.

"Non sequitur. I responded to what you wrote:

<<I've worked among blacks in the blighted urban core for many years. Don't accuse me of being boxed in. I've seen racism and what those blacks regard as racism.>>

Blacks voted overwhelmingly for Hillary and for Democrats generally. Why? Because they know the GOP is the racist party."
Why don't the players do this same protest for all the black gangsters killing people and committing crimes in cities like south Chicago?
"Because black on black crime is the direct root of the police contacts and injuries.  Black shootings by the police are a symptom of black on black crime.  Gangs kill each other and sell drugs and other crimes, the police respond to those crimes as demanded by the community.  The police get no cooperation from the community and have to contact yet even more people to identify who is involved.  That contact infuriates those people and you get confrontation which leads to more injuries.  Is it not that straight forward, nah it has to be a bunch of cops who are racist."
"I'm all for free speech, but if you're liking a picture of a black person with a noose around their neck, you better expect backlash."
"No, they are uncomfortable with outspoken, uppity Black folks! When Americans of color demand Equal Rights and Equal treatment by the government, courts, and institutions of this country; racists get very uncomfortable!"

That's the point. If there weren't so many guns on the street, there would be fewer gun homicides.
""Deaths from mass shootings are such a small percentage of the total, they're almost irrelevant."" They're not irrelevant to the friends and family of the 59 people killed and 500+ wounded in Las Vegas.

"Black women in prostitution who use IV drugs are where the spread is now. Needle exchange stops that. Immorality, of course, is millions of years old.

Female ordination means men need to behave better in the Church. A plus."
I challenge you to identify someone mentioned in this article that is black.

"Blackface is patently offensive? Are the letter signers sure that they want to stand behind that assertion? If they don't like her judgement, they just should not invite her to future parties.

Proof of that can regularly be observed in the non-persecution of black people who call each other niggers."
"That is a ridiculous comment. We both know that almost without exception the 4,000 people lynched in the South were black."

The thing about free speech and the first amendment is there are a lot of people with different values and opinions and life experiences than us in this Country. Some of it makes us uncomfortable, and is offensive to us. It's uncomfortable for me to watch people kneeling for the Anthem. But it's even more uncomfortable for me to consider that we have a problem in this country with police officers shooting black men.

Is there something I've written that I'm not aware of that lets you know that to be true?  You really are too funny.

You did say one sane thing.  ""Call[ing] attention to an issue is a good thing.  Doing it during the National Anthem is a dumb thing.  Having spoiled rich players of a game is even dumber.  The richest player on the Broncos is a black man.  Von Miller can go to his old neighborhood and help his old neighbors by raising money to build a boys and girls club.  He can fund several scholarships for minorities.  But kneeling helps no one but it pisses fans off.  When enough fans turn their backs on the NFL and the League folds, who is helped then?"

"Racism, sexism and discrimination in general has always and will always exist.  People rise above their detractors and gain their respect.  In this manner the barriers are broken down and, one by one, eliminated.
When Obama was elected the annual poll of black America showed that discrimination was not their greatest impediment but rather a lack of education.  Throughout his Presidency, Obama has cried racism at every turn.  Time and again it turns out he was incorrect.  It seems he is just crying, ""wolf,"" to draw ignorant people away from the truth.

Who can't admire a successful person?  Actually the Left political wing hates successful women and  minorities as it destroys their narrative that they need to take care of everyone.  In the narrative of the Left, women and other minorities are incapable of much of anything and need to be taken care of by a benevolent government."

Noteworthy is the bearded mullah with a uniform to emulate that of the somber  Episcopalian (or Methodist) in the full Anglican collar (sporting a gay stole).  
Remarkable also is the Afro hairstyle behind with cross earrings.  The cross is not meant as an object of adornment, jewelry, particularly in presumably a woman's ear.
So: this display is all about costumes, and not about Jesus.
If the pastors were all about curing souls, they would encourage illegal immigrants to comply with the law of the land and become legal immigrants.

May take some time for them to come to terms with it but all the LGB people I know felt the way they do ""from day one"". The myth that people ""choose"" to be LGBTQ is one of the most evil lies that is still commonly spread, it is the foundation of homophobia in Russian and eastern Europe as well as much of the Arab world.  It is akin to the anti-semitic tropes of jews and greed or money and similar.  

Freedom against arbitrary discrimination is one of the underpinnings of our society socially, politically, and legally.  To suggest that it infringes on a business owners right to free excersize or expression requiring them to serve LGBTQ people or to provide birth control coverage is just a re-run of the Jim Crow laws the southern states used to oppress black people for decades, the targets now are women and LGBTQ because...well, ignorance!"
"Muslims are a minority with a particular potential to change the face of this country in a hurry. Precedents abound. Quebec is making a clear and reasonable statement that it will not submit to ideologies, religions or foreign cultures. The requirement to show one's face is hardly onerous. People seeking a new and privileged life in an open and free society, should expect that they will have to accommodate the community they are joining, not the other way around.

In Canada, wearing a religious mask or covering your entire body, head to toe, in a black sack is an extreme act of religious expression, and one that underscores a desire to be apart from, rather than part of, Canadian society. Please, just a moment of common sense ... Is it any wonder that such ridiculous and provocative garb evokes negative sentiment?"
"Clearly, the man that was shot didn't follow the officers instructions. He was ordered to stop and go to his knees for 15 seconds before he ended up getting shot. That is 15 seconds he decided to NOT follow the officers orders. No, that isn't punishable by death, but if he reached into the car after 15 seconds of disobeying, then that is.

I believe the black community is stuck in a cycle that they need help to get out of (better education, etc). That being said, they still make the decisions they do that perpetuate the cycle. The black community as a whole needs to take control of their community and work together to fix items within their control. Remember, they decide(statistically as a group) to drop out of school, have kids at a young age, not go to college, or not to obey an officers orders. I've known many black men that chose to go to college and better their lives. They are the same men that choose to obey an officer. They are very successful as well, because they chose to be!"

"Yeah, those schools have been taken to court by teachers and other WHO WERE FIRED for no other reason than they got married. The CCC you traditionalists love so much says that homosexuals should not suffer ""unjust discrimination"", a statement honored more in the breech than in the observance.

Homosexuals should not suffer ""unjust discrimination"".  I agree, but isn't the employee who does not agree with Jesus' teachings on marriage discriminating against the Catholic School/Church by forcing them to go against their own Mission.  (In other words, teach that Jesus said, ""You have heard from the beginning that a man shall leave his mother and father and cling to his wife and the two shall become one.........."" and then condoning the actions of teachers in a same sex marriage. I believe when an employee of a Christian / Catholic School, University / Organization / Institute, etc. does not agree with its teachings/Mission, they should not take them to court because of their beliefs."

"During World War II, African-American enlistment was at an all time high, with more than 1 million serving in the armed forces. However, the U.S. military was still heavily segregated. The air force and the marines had no blacks enlisted in their ranks, and the navy only accepted blacks as cooks and waiters. The army had only five African-American officers. In addition, no African-American would receive the Medal of Honor during the war, and their tasks in the war were largely reserved to noncombat units. Black soldiers had to sometimes give up their seats in trains to the Nazi prisoners of war.

It would take over 50 years and a presidential order before the U.S. Army reviewed their records in order to award any Medals of Honor to black soldiers. This war marked the end of segregation in the U.S. military. In 1948 President Truman signed Executive Order 9981, officially ending segregation and racial inequality in the military."
"Obama certainly made some mistakes, but if you can't see how the right pushed division at every single opportunity you really haven't been paying attention.

What it comes down to, and it took me a long time to realize this, but ultimately it came down to Obama being a black guy.  Oh, the right in general couched their racism in dog whistles, but in the end they did everything they could do to divide this county. Their media machine, embodied in talk radio and the internet kept up a constant drumbeat of propaganda that talked about how Obama isn't a ""Real American"" or how he is a secret Muslim, or whatever crazy theory they could push."

"I'd have been happier had Mr. Pitts told the truth about targeting black voters, but then hadn't tried to 'soften' it by saying it real target was Democrats.  I'm old enough to remember when it was the Democrats targeting--and lynching--black voters.  Perhaps my memory is a little longer than Mr. Pitts'.  If the last election didn't demonstrate the utter lack of difference between the two erstwhile (ersatz) ""parties"", what will?

But as much as I've liked some of Pitts' past editorials, his job probably rides on his not drawing too much attention to that fact: ""the purpose of the President is not to wield power, but to draw attention away from it."" (Douglas Adams--""Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy"")"

Clinton was talking about the worst out there, you know it, I know it: she meant the folks who want to hurt gay people, Muslims, blacks, and women. She wasn't talking about conservatives generally.  If someone panders to the aforementioned desire to hurt those groups?  Like Leitch does, as she stumbles and equivocates to simply define which Canadian values she's invoking as she calls for vague action against a certain 'kind' of immigrant?  Then that someone is deplorable. Textbook, actually."

Trump ran on a platform of repudiating all that President Obama represented.....and he won.  I had hoped President Obama's election represented a significant step toward a truly ""post-racism"" America.....boy, was I ever wrong.  With his election, millions of racists across America saw ""license"" to come out of the shadows and flaunt their racism, and they did.  That racism was not the only appeal of Trump, but, let's be frank here, it clearly was one of them.

"You need to catch up on your history before making remarks such as these otherwise you risk making a mockery of yourself.  There are many good books on the history of islam.  I suggest reading one that was published before 1950 so as to quell any concern you might have over who attacked who first, which with islam does not matter.  You may find it interesting that in 1786 Muslim ships were harassing American ships off what is now the US Seaboard.  At that time the US Navy had just three ships.  The American Government decided it best to pay them a bribe to avoid having their colonists abducted and returned to Africa to be sold as slaves, which is what these muslims were interested in doing.  So a bribe was paid and the Barbary Corsairs returned to the Mediterranean.  Does this constitute a first attack?  If so then muslims attacked the USA first."
"""racism is the true darkness at the heart of the matter""

Because I believe this, and other people who think like me believe this, and we've repeated it so many times that we now simply accept it as a fact.  Donald Trump is a racist and so is anyone who voted for him.

You guys (more accurately, the media, you just repeated it) peddled this narrative throughout the entire election.  Then you lost, and it was determined to be false.  Apparently, that news hasn't made it's way to the top of the ivory towers yet.  When we look at the data we see that Trump won counties that swung the election for Obama.  Millions of Obama voters didn't magically become racists in 4 years.  Why would millions of racists vote for a black president twice?  That makes no sense at all.  My article is much better than yours (better research) but Civil Beat didn't publish it because it did not conform the prevailing media narrative.  You can read it here:

"Tamir Rice was gunned down by a cop for suspicion of being armed. He was 12 years old and was shot on sight. Ohio is an open carry state. BTW, his weapon was a toy gun. Of course, he was black.

<<The police officer who shot Scott in the back should receive the death penalty.>>

Meanwhile, could you be more condescending? One wonders if you ever encounter black people. They're actually fully capable of grasping where government funding comes from. ""Don't know any better."" You have no idea what you're talking about.

If it's any consolation the poor black people I'm aware of who live in subsidized housing and visit food banks, etc., lead extremely stressful lives and deal with frequent humiliations because of their race and poverty (yet are the first to praise God; go figure). But I guess that's not good enough to satisfy your mysterious sense of injury."

My position is the opposite of ""approval""--it's rejection of BOTH factions of neo-fascists. And I say so as someone who fully recognizes that the current version of your quote is ""first they came for the Blacks, then they came for the Muslims"". My family is both.

Under Obamacare, my previously unaffordable premium is now down to 90 dollars per month. My car insurance is down to 25 dollars per month (from Insurance-Panda). My homeowners is $25/month too. Under Trump, expect inflation and massive price hikes across the board.

This ship is sinking faster than Trump’s approval rating. Trump’s cover-up is getting smaller than his hands too. All these blind Trump supporters wanna do is complain about the media. Please, I’ve seen kids that whine less."
"I wonder how many of BLM are actually LGBTQ. Gay Pride has worked hard to gain respect and validation within society, to the point where LGBTQ members of the police, like LGBTQ members of every other section of society, feel that they have a place within the community. BLM, on the other hand, have had difficulty getting their message across. Canadians just do not believe that their police officers are trigger-happy racists randomly killing blacks. So their strategy is to use Gay Pride to validate and promote their views. 

Annual General meetings are always at risk for takeovers by small groups of determined individuals. The answer, if Gay Pride does not want to be split into a hundred feuding pieces, is to arrange a special meeting and make sure that there are enough LGBTQ members from all parts of society to reverse this divisive decision."
"Hello Lex,

Okay, let's work through your proposal for comparison.

At the (let's say made-up) Lexington College of the University of Ontario, two black fellows and a Jewish fellow are sitting at a table with a retired atheist professor. 

Up to the table walks the Dean and Associate Dean of the college, whose names are Himmler and Goebbels.

The retired atheist professor turns to the Jewish fellow and says: ""With those names in charge of things, aren't you nervous about the showers?""

The retired atheist professor has spent the last 40 years writing textbooks in support of civil rights for Blacks in America, documenting racist attacks and discrimination against Black folks there.

So, Lex, do you want that professor fired?"
"Good post.  My deep and long American history also includes adoptions, and was highlighted greatly to our family last year when my father did a genetic spit test : our previously 'english' heritage really was more German, along with eastern european jew and 'iberian peninsula'.  Why did we 'forget' our 'shameful' German backgrounds, easy :  WWI and WWII we served here for the USA.  Why was our darker skin 'iberian' forgotten : my family was full of racists, plain and simple.  Just watching an NFL game with my grandfather who I loved dearly, was sometimes very painful when he would go on and on about blacks who he did not call black but every derogatory name in the book.

America is a great place to be, freedom and liberty are here to stay.  It only took 2 generations to wipe out religion in our family, and as many generations to wipe out our racist points of view for at least some of us ... we are truly mixing pot Americans, and I wouldn't have it any other way.

"Pride does not want police participation at their private event, that is their prerogative.  Would you want your historical abusers to walk side by side with you when they have never shown remorse, apologized or made any manner of conciliatory efforts regarding their historical treatment of gays?  Or blacks?

Have you spoken to any openly gay officers to find out how the have been treated by their fellow officers? To this day? How about female officers?

The police approach the community with an us vs. them attitude, so it's perfectly understandable that Pride would reflect the polices very own approach to the public.

This move by Pride should send a very clear message to police, that the police have though their very own voluntary actions, broken the social contract and the gay and black communities do not trust them to behave lawfully and respectfully with their public employer. 

Note to police, if you violate the constitution, you will be treated accordingly."

The violence in those areas is not because of the guns it is strictly economics, those individuals are just angry at life in general."
"Exactly! Nobody I went to school with had never heard or had any concept of homosexuality. In my early teens I was shocked to learn of sex between man and woman. ""My mother and father would never do that,"" I remember shouting out.
I learned about homosexuality later through men coming on to me. I encountered men who I would now describe as 'camp' but had no idea what they got up to. Something, instinct, sixth sense or Our Lord maybe, preserved me in my innocence from the advances I was subjected to. None of these advances were from priests or teachers I might add.

Reasonable people do not want to be forced to take a side, yet the media seems to be pushing people to pick a side.  All the violent groups are wrong."

Winning in war is often only a matter of inches, and unnecessary distraction or any dilution of the combat effectiveness puts the mission and lives in jeopardy.

"Alceste, I didn't miss it. I'm just aware that regardless of race a firm may purport to think something is wonderful until, in the real world, it interferes with someone's ability to work untold hours without letting the pastime interfere. Not a race thing. Just a Bay Street thing. 

The author herself seems to identify with liking Nina Simone as being unique to Her and People Like Her. I'm confused why a NYC singer is uniquely relatable to a Canadian with Caribbean heritage unless she is making the point that all blacks are alike which strikes me as facile."
"But to you it's not racist when someone voted for him because he's half Black or sexist because some people voted for her because she's a woman!

This is why liberals/progressives aren't taken seriously as intellectually driven people."
"The fear is that if all who are called by God to be priests can be ordained, a priest will be respected and admired and promoted based on his or her talents and spiritual strengths in Christ instead of his grand sacrifice to give up marriage for the sake of pastoring a parish.

Now how great a pastor, preacher, leader, teacher, confessor, etc will be what a priest is valued for and those priests weak in these talents and spiritual skills will start to appear as the weak priests that they are and get pushed aside.  

Also women priests mean women bishops, cardinals and popes, real equality, so no one group of automatically lesser humans - to tell yourself - Well, at least I will always be more important than those people.  This could equally apply if we were to decide we don't need any black male priests or Hispanic priests.   If Trump were pope, people like Pope Francis would be told they can't be priests because Hispanic men are all unclean, violent criminals."
"In short, the structure of the Welfare System has created more single moms, the destruction of the family unit, the high unemployment rate among black youth, and the high crime rate.  The Welfare System incentivizes all of the negatives.  And once a kid has a criminal record, he's virtually unemployable for the rest of his life, so crime is his only option.

And that's why it's called ""The Welfare Trap.""  You can't get out of it."
"Yes, many in the South did claim and still claim that their discrimination against Black people was/is Bible based.  I don't know what they cite - in part because I never even tried to get in a Bible verse back and forth with a Biblical literalist - useless.  Equally, true I would have lost any such battle since my religious upbringing  didn't include memorization of vast sections of the Bible.  I was raised on Catholic catechism and good manners.   

I think a modern society has to have some rules about how far someone with strongly held religious beliefs can go in expressing those beliefs when that impinges on the freedoms of others.  And that includes how far bosses can go in a business that serves the public and hires people of different/no religious faith.  Think health insurance and LGBT marriage. 

How to reconcile fundamentalism with individual freedom and opportunity is what we are trying to figure out."
"Hogwash.  Only 40% of the Universities are seeing declines.  Why not all, if it is simply related to Trump.  UO in particular made national and international news with their treatment of the professor who put on black make-up in her home.  Couple that with the plentiful news stories about UO's self-proclaimed ""rape culture,"" why would a foreign (or out of state) student want to attend."
"What if she( or any public official for that matter) had ""likely"" said something along the lines of ""We need more blacks (or hispanics,or ...) in government"", would that be considered ""racist""? Now one could quibble with her powers of observation,  since it's obvious to anyone with grey matter that fair skinned types dominate all levels of government, but really this whole business seems like a tempest in a teapot."
"Incompetence, YES, just like a couple of years ago when the Downtown Athletic Club hired this new supposed  high profile General Manager.    He had a resume that listed some other prestigious clubs, degrees in this and that etc.  From the get go, none of the other employees liked this guy.  The other employees said his management style was not coming from a athletic club scenario, something is extremely wrong here.  1 year later, Someone there started checking on his proclaimed references etc., and low and behold, this guy was a FAKE, a impersonator, nothing on his resume was true.  The Bennett  family suffered two black eyes on that one.  I do not know if the person who hired this imposter was terminated.

"""You should read the Washington Post's coverage of the background to Ferguson; it explains a lot about why Michael Brown's death was so incendiary.""

(A) BACKGROUND to Ferguson. (B) Whatever happened during the shooting of Michael Brown, you have concluded apparently that it was some sort of plot ""to attack and kill our police officers."" Evidence for that conspiracy theory? (c) BLM originated as a response to multiple shootings and/or deaths of black men in police custody. It's message is simple, and in keeping with American values. Why anyone would want to live in a police state in which officers can shoot to kill with impunity is beyond me."
"Of course Obama had a lot of superdelegates.  His surge started way before Bernie's (much smaller) surge.  And was way bigger (no surprise that Dems would be crawling all over themselves to jump on the first viable black POTUS candidate bandwagon).  

50 superdelegates did swap from Hillary to Obama later in the process, but that wasn't anywhere close to the 450 early-declared superdeegate lead that Hillary had over Bernie.  

Also, Obama and Hillary both occupied a similar lane in the middle of the Dem spectrum.  Bernie was in his own socialist lane (the far left of the party).  The only reason he even got more than the usual 10% or so for an extremist is because Hillary was such a bad candidate (the same reason that Trump beat her, in fact)."
"Right on, Martin!  After looking at the picture of the cemetery in Normandy where our World War II heroes are buried, I have to admire those people.  They actually fought and died for something bigger than themselves.  What are those kneeling NFL players doing other than making fools of themselves on national TV?  Even though a lot of them are black, they certainly aren't making lives better for their fellow blacks.  If they really cared about their fellow human beings, they'd be back in their hometowns cleaning up neighborhoods, patrolling the streets to protect against crime, providing kids with reading materials, helping single moms, and so on.  And I think their national anthem protests are going to backfire on them in a big way.  Already, fans aren't showing up at the stadiums.  If that continues, the home games of the teams won't be broadcast.  Maybe that'll jolt those ego driven rich guys into reality."

Absolutely true.  From the time Oregon became a Territory in 1849 we have NEVER had a Territorial or State official assassinated.  You have to go clear back to 1844 to dig up the killing of  George Lebreton, Clerk and Recorder of the Provisional Government  who was shot and killed   in the famous  ""Cockstock Afair"" as he tried to break up a fight between an Indian and a black person over a dispute over a horse.  We've never had such troubles again until recently when  a paranoid collection of bullies began making outrageous threats of violence upon our leaders.

"Thanks, ATF.  I see his suggestion as a two-sided coin, one side where any progression and inclusion of women is good and the other as one more way for women to be both separate and still not equal.

I don't think the examples are extreme.  Discrimination is discrimination, no matter the traditions or rationales used to prop it up.

Trump began his presidential bid with racist speech when he stated that Mexican immigrants were drug dealers, rapists and murderers

Then he called for a Muslim Ban because he believed that only Muslims could be terrorists

He attacked a Muslim Gold Star family and assumed that the wife was not allowed to speak simply because she was a woman when the truth was that she was overcome by grief

He claimed that African American communities are filled with drug dealers and murderers to the extent that people cannot walk down the street without being shot

Other scandals attributed to both Bill and Hillary include Whitewater, Travelgate, Vince Foster, Paula Jones, Monica Lewinsky, Hillary's treatment of all Bill's sexual assault victims, Filegate, Benghazi, Clinton Foundation misuses, and her private email server. The only reason they got away with it is due to their elite status and connections. Who knows what else they've gotten away with.

One more thing I almost forgot to mention: the Clinton's involvement in the DNC conspiracy to deny Bernie Sanders the Democratic nomination."
"There should be investigation by Alaska Department of Fish and Game. Any officers involved should be terminated or reprimanded. Police are shooting blacks in greater numbers. We should start protesting the  innocent murdered of Black Bears. Where is PETA, SPCA, Alaska Humane Society and ACLU.?"
"Seriously? Now you are gonna blame McGill for ""caving in"" to those bad tribal Quebeckers? 

Andrew Potter, to his enormous credit:
- admitted that most of his text was built around rhetorics instead of facts;
- apologized for writing such a terrible article.

As a result, he decided to step down not as a professor, but as head of the institute of... Canadian studies, of all institutes! Do I think he should have? It's irrelevant. He felt like he should, and it's not a crazy decision at all.

By the way, I think it is worth wondering whether those same people would also be so up in arms in the name of ""freedom"" of expression if in this Maclean's article, one would have read ""Muslim community or ""Jewish community or ""Black community"" instead of ""Quebec community"". Rightly, it would have universally been seen as a terrible, discriminatory piece. Generalizations and associations of this type are bad, that's as simple as that."
"As a measure for the law firms, it would be black partner ratio according to the count in the graduating class. This is about understanding proportions and context."
"Even though it's exactly the same logic, apparently one is OK ('gender') and the other is not (race).  Witness the savagery unleashed on Rachel Dolezal for identifying as a black woman...."
"One of the issues here is that beneficent justice does not appear to be of compelling concern until it is a police officer being charged with some offense against a Black person. It is hard not to see a systemic injustice in that disparity, irrespective of the officer's guilt or innocence.  And it's unsurprising that the disparity inspires protest."
"MicroAggression is a bull theory typical of all of these bogus academic areas like gender studies and lGBTQRSTLM&R studies, why do you think they hate science and math so much?  All of their academic work is dubious and mainly used to support stupid policies that actually increase racism and segregation.  Who ever heard of microagressions before?  It is completely made up and doesn't pass the smell test.

In the case of BEP, the activists want black only schools, lower academic standards, more taxdollars and resources for them only.  Microaggressions becomes and excuse for all their failures.  Personal accountability is dismissed and the demands for 'equality' (which is really taking things away from others who had nothing to do with their so called microaggressions) grow louder and louder, a la BLM.

So many excuses and micro aggression is another bogus concept."

Hmm, let's look at the cited ""High Tech sources"":

TechGirls Canada - looks to be in government handout business, shills for private businesses too:
.
""Proudly supporting Women of Colour, LGBTTQ, and Aboriginal Trailblazers, ""
""... works to advocate for resources, funding, private and public sector partnership opportunities, and catalyze joint programs""
.
Wealthsimple - ""investing on autopilot"" , 2 full time job postings, 1 intern
.
Shopify - that is a big one,  and needs a lot of low cost ... PHP developers ( oh, so high tech).

They are the ones who spearheaded the ""10 000 000 coders needed in Canada"" idiotic puplications 6 months ago.
.

So there you have it - the Canadian ""high tech"" industry."
"The US conducts false flag attacks, bombs sovereign countries for oil, and sends not-yet-proven-guilty ""terrorists"" to black sites around the world to be tortured. If we have no qualms dealing with America, then we shouldn't have any about China other. The hypocrisy is already evident in that our second largest arms consumer is Saudi Arabia. The boat on moral superiority sailed a long time ago, and we weren't on it. It's time for some people to get over themselves."
"Jesse Jackson now blames ""the suppression of the Black vote"" for Trump""s win. He, like many race leaders in America, are just racists making a buck.  Two months after the election and he decides to add an extra dose of  damnation for Trump.  But the media will accept it and say  ""Oh Yes Mr Jackson, you  are so wise"". despite no corroborating evidence or  complaints anybody was denied their vote. ."
"I've been thinking the same thing, that's how the game is these days for the most part. No sacrifices or anything like that because teams don't want to give up outs and are instead willing to roll the dice on getting multiple hits or a home run.

Time for Black to seriously consider trying to manufacture some runs (bunts, hit & run, stolen bases, etc.) since this offense has gone in the tank. I think the make up of the lineup tonight will tell a lot about how Black is approaching this game with the offense in a complete stall."

Well, the Judge was not alone/the only one.

There are many Judges in Canada and MANY more in the United States that are of the far right lunatic fringe persuasion that women that are raped are somehow at fault, that people of color that are shot dead are somehow at fault, that women that seek abortion are somehow criminals, that anyone except the wealthy and Wall Street should hang and hang high.

Welcome to the far right lunatic fringe nightmare that is unfolding in parts of Canada and much of the United States.

"Here's a question- do you think this role was originally cast for a Polynesian performer? A cursory look at Wikipedias notable performers of this role I'm seeing Black, Mexican, and mixed race mostly. I might agree if the role was ALWAYS traditionally played by an Asian specifically, but I'm not seeing that tradition here. It wasn't written for an asian,  it was written for a woman. To cast an asian would be gravy but it sounds like its just not feasible."
"Hotdog:  You're quite right...this is no laughing matter.  If, as claimed, such a direct racist threat was made, it would be tough to continue living in the neighborhood.  This is especially true since the ""black Gentleman"" (as Just Inn calls him) filed a criminal complaint agains Mr. Blomberg.  I certainly wouldn't want to have a neighbor who had already threatened me out on bond and facing charges which I filed.  IMO, this is a recipe for escalating violence. I wouldn't feel safe either.  I hope the conditions for bail included what would amount to a restraining order to stay away from that ""Black gentleman.""  August 15th, Mr. Blomberg's next court date is a long-way off.  I hope the DA and Sheriff's office aren't taking this situation too ""lightly.""  Mr. Blomberg's criminal history seems to ""red flag"" him as a real potential danger.  Not good..................."
"Obviously, Ms. Backlin is uninformed as to Drumpf's racist dealings over the past 40 years.  His father was arrested for marching with the KKK back in the 1920's, Drumpf and daddy-dearest were sued in the 1970's for discriminating against African Americans who wanted to rent their low-income apartments and paid one of the highest fines assessed for discrimination, and more recently his birther movement was nothing but an objection to a ""black"" man in the highest office of this country.  I suggest you do some reading up on Drumpf.  One book I would suggest is The Lost Tycoon, written in the 1990's.  Otherwise, a great suggestion for you is to keep your mouth shut until you're fully informed as to who this man really is."

"Very well said.  I have never seen Ms. Khan express most of the ideas her detractors ascribe to her.  Interestingly, The Guardian hired an outside firm to analyze their readers' comments.  The data indicated that when it came to news and opinion articles, negative comments were disproportionately high for articles written by women, people with brown skin and ""non-traditional"" names.  Sheema Khan hits all three of those categories!  Often, rather than respond to her content, people pop off with remarks about the evils of Fundamentalist Islam, the terror of Sharia Law, the horrors of multiculturalism, and how ""those people"" just don't integrate (I recall the same being said of Italians in the 60s.)  I find her columns often insightful and have never once seen her attack Canada; many of the posters are simply tilting at a brown, female, Muslim windmill.

Without skipping a beat, the mailshot moguls, who year after year make money selling the notion there’s been a right resurgence out there in the hinterland with massed legions of haters, have used the election of a black president to say that, yes, hate is on the rise and America ready to burst apart at the seams, with millions of extremists primed to march down Main Street draped in Klan robes, a copy of Mein Kampf tucked under one arm and a Bible under the other, available for sneak photographs from minions of Chip Berlet, another salesman of the Christian menace,  ripely endowed with millions to battle the legions of the cross.</i>

"I'm done with the Broncos too. They can't even issue this statement without talking out of both sides of their mouths. Why are these spoiled athletes allowed this disrespectful voice and President Trump is not? Why is his speech divisive and theirs is not? He was elected to lead. He is. These players are not leading. They're disgraceful. What are they united against? Police? Then have the guts to say it! If that is your message, have the courage to say it and allow Americans to decide. The NFL is horrific. You penalize players if they wear a symbol for 9/11 or murdered Dallas cops? But you can't say anything about this, even though your rules say you can? So young black men are being killed and nobody is going to jail? That's your protest? It is happening, every day, in Chicago,at the hands of other young black men. Your protest is in the Chicago Mayor's office. My Broncos jerseys is in the trash. I'm going to spend my time celebrating heroes like our Police, firefighters and military."

The race and the great divide was started by the illegitimate term of a non eligible Kenyan that just because of his color and not to piss off the black race won. 
I didn't vote for him because he admitted he was a Muslim and then he denied it. But his book ""Dreams of my father"", or ""The audacity of hope"" proves my point. If he is willing to take the Muslim side then he is a Muslim.

"Wow! Great article Froma! Even Bernie, too! (more people in Seattle than all of Vermont - chuckle).
Now, carry on the discussion to H1-B Visas. Since those are issued where the US ""doesn't have those skills"" (yeah, right), and the big 3 or 4 in our local area are hurting our local economy by not hiring our own people, the following progressive proposal in line with Trump's hire Americans first:
For every H1-B Visa employee hired, the employer must hire an American to work with the person from the other country to learn the job. This, so that when the Visa runs out, an American is retained and employed. And, concerning Bernie's numbers, the American trainee must be from the pool of worst percentage, currently black Americans. Bernie says 51% which is very believable.
When was the last time Microsoft, Amazon, Google and Starbucks hired a black American for their $150K/year programming jobs? They fan the flames of employment discrimination, and stoke it with foreign coal as well."
"I'm not frustrated, I'm at very low risk of being shot by police. Situations where objectively ""the suspect clearly and obviously attacked police"" rarely occur outside a vacuum. Life is messy, life is unpredictable. In every police shooting video I've seen thus far I could understand how the police justified using their weapon. In all but one video I could see how people took exception.

One trend that I've noticed in the videos I've seen is that the suspects tend to be very resistant to the officers. This alone doesn't justify being shot, but it escalates the situation significantly. In some its hard to tell if they are fighting officers or just trying to protect themselves.

In my opinion, the exclusivity of their message limits how much change they will affect. From what I've seen they will only assemble when a black person has been shot by police and there's room to question their tactics. It's their right."
"""... Something tells me you didn't make it all the way to the summary ...""   Oh, I did indeed read it all the way through.  As for the summary, being as how this paper was published in the _Journal of African American Studies_, the authors were pretty much obliged to conclude, ""Oh!  Oh!  Woe is Us!"", if they wanted to see print.  :-/

Their counter-examples of prevailing excuses for black Americans IMV tended to be highly statistical, even epidemiologic.  It was interesting to me how often they frankly conceded that the opposite side of the argument indeed had a valid point, and how often they had to counter with a ""... yeah, but ...""

The most interesting thing to me was how many examples of prominent (and some not so prominent) black Americans were telling their own fellow-community members that the time for 'making excuses' for personal failure had past with Mr. Obama's election.  I think it a real pity that attitude didn't stick, instead of the Big Victim meme we have instead.  :("
"I had the very experience I cite.  As a young boy in Holland we learned about Zwarte Piet, or Black Peter, who carried away naughty young children in his sack.  I had quite a fear of Zwarte Piet as I was a very disobedient and unruly child as all children of that era were considered to be.  
My first actual encounter with a black person was as a 5 year old seeing a black porter on the CP line as we journeyed across Canada to our new home in Alberta.  I somewhat overcome my fear given the character and humour of this individual and how he treated children like me, on the train.
Regardless of how you feel about the niqab ban, I feel this is a teaching moment.  There's a person inside that niqab who breathes and feels not a lot different from you or me, and who might also have very young children at home, just like this child, and this is what the child should be taught.  Love conquers fear, and the sooner we begin with that, the better, IMO."

This was the party of Lincoln, the party that mustered more congressional votes than the Democrats to pass the equal rights amendment, the party that championed free trade, opened up China, argued for a fiscal restraint and celebrated the fall of the Berlin Wall.

"I think we are going about the abortion issue from the wrong angle.  Of course, it is wrong.  The church should always stay this course.  But in reality, not everyone is Catholic and should have to follow.  By allowing safe abortions and free birth control there are less of them.  If we support women in all ways, they will develop self confidence.  This is what will slow down premarital sex.   Young girls who are not self assured are the ones that think a man will take care of them.  They also believe that sex will get and keep said man."
"Thank you for your thoughts.  I believe, if we are to understand Christ, we have to look at the entirety of his life with his actions speaking louder than his words.  I can also say he said take up your cross and come follow me as well as my grace is sufficient.  Christ's life was no cake walk and I don't think we can expect following him to be without difficulty.  Love and self-sacrifice go hand in hand."
"Okay. Thank you for being civil. I believe in core values, such as our Constitution. I have no faith in Career Politicians, be they right, left or center. I am a Democrat-but I guess 'old school' - like the JFK thinking. 

Now onto your questions.
(Q) how do you feel about racial profiling?
(A) If a race or ethnic group is mentioned because people need to help find a suspect, it is necessary, but not because of the group-but because of the identification only. Like blond hair v black hair v brown hair.

(Q)  Do you think the DP is worried that posting the race of the suspect would be considered profiling?
(A) Yes, but maybe not why you would think. I believe, sadly, that media and people are so worried about appearing 'PC' that they are terrified of any implied profiling. Even when it isn't.
 
In the end, we all want the same things-to be the best country and people we can be?  Our route to that may vary, but civily & together we can work towards that.

"Gays cannot be discriminated against. They are a ""protected class of people"" who cannot be discriminated against.

But, and this may be one of the issues, is ""offensive artwork"" ""people""? Do ""artists"" have the right to claim that ""offensive artwork"" they are being asked to ""create"" is ""offensive artwork"" and, therefore, is not a ""protected class of people""?

That logical reasoning is why a Jewish baker doesn't have to decorate a Nazi cake with Nazi symbols, why a Black baker doesn't have to decorate a cake showing a man being lynched by the KKK, or a painter doesn't have to paint a painting showing Hillary with horns.

It is wrong to discriminate against people.....but ""offensive artwork"" is not ""people"" and is not a ""protected class"" of anything."
"I honestly believe that although we may suggest things to do to make it a more respectful place (ideas above), things will just have to play out on their own. Look at how long it has taken Black Americans to become somewhat 'accepted' citizens in the U.S. Still, there are pockets of people who will NEVER accept them, the same pocket that this junior legislator probably identifies with. We had a Black president, and a good one at that, yet there still was/is disrespect toward him, his family and his people. 

Native Alaskans and Alaska may just have to go through the whole schmeer, the hard way, before the atmosphere in and towards Natives is a more accepting and respectful one. Lawsuits, walks, protests, shootings, you name it. We cannot weed out those who are not accepting just as much as we cannot control what people think, believe in or do.

I actually believe that the process has already been started. We just need to wait, and suffer, until the majority of Alaska/U.S catches up."
"Here's a photo that I would like made into a statue.   https://consortiumnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/slavery_scars.jpg   

This is history.   This is actually far more representative of the history of the south than the absurdity of creating monuments to people who started a civil war to keep slavery legal.  Slavery was already more than 200 years old when the war began.   It continued another 100 years to a great degree through legal segregation under Jim Crow laws.  Do we need photos of what the south looked like under Jim Crow?   There were more than 4,000 lynchings of southern blacks from the beginning of the 20th century through the 50s, some people say 20,000, until Emmett Till.   Maybe a statue of Emmett Till in his open casket would make a good statue.  I like it.  

Those confederate monuments were part of Jim Crow intimidation of black people, who were repeatedly murdered, tortured, burned out and robbed for 100 years.   Our proud history."

"Yes, the South was Democratic.   The United States, which had been secured by the Union Army had as President, Abraham Lincoln, a Republican.  There was no way that Southern racists were going to be Republican after the Civil War, hence the KKK, Jim Crow, etc.  This lasted, the Dixiecrats, until the signing of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by then Democratic President, Lyndon Johnson.   Newly enabled, Blacks then registered heavily as Democratic.  You think the racist South was going to sit for that?  No way.  The South swung heavily into the conservative Republican party after 1964, away from those 'librul' Democrats.  Richard Nixon took advantage of that and won his Presidency appealing to those new Republicans of the South.  This is not the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, folks.  Lincoln would have been called a 'librul' Republican in his day."
"In general , nobody has a right ""not to feel"" anything. The issue is fact, not feelings. Black students have a right not to BE threatened by their fellow students.

"The very first ""gun-control"" laws were indeed against African Americans.  1640's on we see a series of them.

Or that 5 states remained IN the union AND remained slave states (the IRS taxing slave sales starting in 1862 to pay for the war).Or slavery was still legal in DC. during the Civil War.  Or that the emancipation proclamation didn't free ANY of those slaves.  Or, that the ""civil war"" was fought to preserve the union, NOT free the slaves.

American patriots who are opposed to the disruption/aggression from the black clad counter-protesting (while hiding their faces as to not be recognizable later on)  bother you that much? Why?
"I tend to be a bit more optimistic. Americans have been looking for change for a few decades. They tried an articulate black president who expressed hope. They tried the anti-establishment ""Tea Party"" in Congress. Now they are trying the underqualified but one-of-us kind of guys.

But the founding fathers developed a clever political system that resists major change.

Sooner or later American voters, and politicians will realize incremental change through bipartisanship and compromise is the only way to make progress.

It may take another cycle to two. Hopefully not too much damage will be done before then."
"This is to all those commentators here who act to disparage ""our neighbors down South"" because they accuse the latter's hearts of shriveling into dried black husks in the wake of this 'News' story: (dispensing with any cynicism now) there are a couple of rather conspicuous AMERICAN CITIZENS, born & raised there, who between 2009 & 2015 have already donated over $$ 1.5 BILLION to this very cause...

"Arinze, being African, brings to mind an idea for a film that I have toyed with. Chris Rock has shared some of his comedy acts on you tube. His, "" Take no Prisoners "", approach to social commentary would give an interesting flavor to a retelling of the story of Adam and Eve. Contrasting that Myth, introduced rather rudely to the African population, with more organic Creation Tales from the Dark Continent, could be enlightening and enjoyable. I was surprised at the number of articles that address the prospect of a Black Adam amd Eve to be found on Google. I can see one of my Primordial Brothers attempting to ""Spark"" one of the tribal Chieftan's daughters or wives and having communitarian priveleges revoked. A , "" Sex is Nasty ""  belief might find its' Genesis radically reenforced by such a banishment. If Chris balks at casting himself as Protagonist, he may settle for the Serpentine Antagonist. His portrayal of particularly strong Feminine partners solidify Eve as very interesting."
"I have been to Dachau.   It is a memorial and a reminder.   It honors the victims of the concentration camp.  When I was there long ago, there was a huge photograph of a beautiful young Jewish man being tortured to death hanging in a room.   In the rooms with beds, there were large photos of emaciated people being starved to death.   In other places were photographs of the mass graves, people being worked to death, etc.  The memorial was a real memorial, and a real reminder.

The United States has nothing like what the Germans have done in connection with the Nazi Holocaust.    The US has never been the least bit realistic or honest, not in history classes or in politics or in philosophy or in popular or common knowledge, in connection with both the genocide of Native Americans, and the slavery of African Americans.

I don't support people's right to their false histories and psychopathy."
"You ask interesting questions.  Yes, there are incidents of ""star"" athletes also being ""star"" students.  To be sure, the U of O, for example, has had athletes who are also great students.  This occurs more often in ""minor"" non-revenue sports than it does in, especially, football and men's basketball.  Elite football and basketball players are far more likely to have spent their youth concentrating on their athletics rather than academics...this is not a racist or unfair comment.  To be sure, D1 football and basketball have an ""overrepresentation"" of, especially, Black athletes.  People find this ""akward"" to discuss, but it's simply a fact. IMO, this over-representation results from socioeconomic factors and is not a reflection on race per se' and athletics have been an avenue for many inner-city Blacks to better their lives....including receiving an college education.  It's also simply a fact that many of them have ""weaker"" academic backgrounds than most entering students. (cont)"
"When the Italians came, they spoke Italian for a long time, especially in their neighborhoods.  The same can be said for the Germans, Swedes, Poles,  Chinese, etc,  and you know what, people of those times made the same complaint as you.  ""Identity politics"" is something people made up in order to disparage the continued fight for equal rights, and liberal/Marxist is a term invented to disparage those who fight for equal rights .  You are absolutely right that equal rights should lead to color blindness, but it also goes the other way - you need equal rights for everyone to achieve color blindness.  And Dean, this country has talked of the melting pot for more than a century, and for more than a century many people have excluded immigrants and people of color from the pot.  You say you worked in the civil rights movement, yet you ignore history with the comment ""dismantle the melting pot idea which made us so cohesive""."
"Um... I am an American and I know PLENTY of African Americans who voted for Trump. There's a reason he did better with them than Romney.

Last Sunday, while staying at a hotel in Lafayette, Louisiana, an African American female guest started talking to me about politics. She told me she voted for Trump because he is a businessman, and is only taking one dollar in salary. You have no idea of the hidden support by African Americans for Trump"
"""Jared Kushner, an Orthodox Jew"".
Hmmm.. in all his appearances I've seen him dressed in a regular business suit, shirt and tie, not even a kippa on his head. To the best of my knowledge, orthodox Jews are dressed, well, like orthodox Jews; with the prayer shirt, the black robe, long beard and a black hat, or indoors a kippa.
Like the reporter at Mr. Trump's news conference.
Regardless, what is the news here? The antisemitic incidents, or Ivanka Trump?
Journalism 101: know your topic."
"I'm shocked by this law but I applaud it.Everyone is so afraid of the appearance of being racist.
Last summer my kids were swimming at a public pool. A woman wearing a a hijab, burka and shoes (the same clothes she was wearing outside even though there is a sign that states No Outside Clothing) stood at the bottom of the water slide. (She just stood there!!)She looked like a big black jellyfish. The kids could not go down the slide because they would hit her.
If I wore my jeans and sneakers in the pool and blocked the bottom of the slide, I would have been punted.
The lifeguard did not say anything because she said ""Im afraid to""
Thankyou Quebec for kicking political correctness to the curb and doing the logical thing."
Not sure why this is such a controversial issue.  I know veterans who support the protest (i.e. they fought for the right for those to express themselves) and vets who think the whole thing is silly and disrespectful.  In the end it is under two minutes that this freedom to protest occurs.  Why all the fuss over two minutes?  Sigh!  Remember that the original intent of the protests were to bring attention to police violence and harassment on African Americans.  Which is a problem in this country that needs to be addressed - its intent was never to demean veterans who fought valiantly for the right to protest.
"This, like the Bell Curve, ignores the environmental impact on career choice. I scored in the 98th percentile on science achievement tests. No one encouraged me to pursue medical research. It was unheard of because of my race and gender. Never tested, they said I had average or below average intelligence. At the age of 47 years,  I scored as intellectually superior on one test and higher than 705 of the population on the other. These scores were met with displeasure by my career counselor. Empowered I finished my B.S. degree, pursued a career in technical communication. Exclusionary and abusive environments limit academic and career choice.  Blacks pursue careers in sports not because their brains and bodies are hardwired to excel there, but because they are exposed to it in their environment and it is where they see people that look like them succeed.  My premise: women exposed to exclusionary and abusive environments cause changes in the areas of the brain that impact career choice."
"I call this Fake Comment.
There is nothing at all to suggest what you have said is true.
Trump has said time and time again he wants to make African American communities better, starting by building infrastructure in the inner cities, reducing crime, and putting jobs in these cities.
He wants to help all people of all races.
I feel sorry for you in buying into the SJW and MSM non-sense."
"Cool.  So happy to see that you are not one of those liberal ""anti-fa"" fascists who say that any opinion not the same as theirs is hate speech so it is their duty to cover their faces in black masks and disrupt physically any attempt for another opinion to be expressed in colleges or for groups to join and march in order to express that opinion. Good to meet someone from the left who while not necessarily open to the opinion at least will allow it to be expressed.  I am old enough to remember the day when the saying by both sides was - ""I disagree with your words but will fight to the death for your right to say it.  I think you meant ""fair weather fan"" - which I most certainly am.  I will not ever allow my emotions to go to either extreme over a bunch of grown men, most of whom don't even live in Colorado much less being neighbors, who night lose while playing a game.  LOL"
"Black Lives Matter in itself is a very divisive means of proving a point. While I agree with the rationale of bringing awareness to equality, it is demonstrative of the very thing it is trying to promote.
The minorities across our nation are proving a point, but, why can't we utilize a slogan that includes ALL minority groups that are affected due to racial and ethnic biases.
Wouldn't ALL LIVES MATTER be a better portrayal of the goal?"
"I think neil Black and a few others sit up at night waiting for a shooting incident so they can get on their soap box and preach the evils of gun owners. They pretend that I want a 30 round magazine for hunting, or that because a bad guy gets shot that guns must become non-existent so that peace will reign.
But as long as bad guys have guns, I want one, with a 30 round mag so that if/when it becomes necessary I can protect myself. 
Want me to unarm? Make the world a place where self defence is not necessary! Then, we can talk."
"And since the real pervasive slaughter of black men is perpetrated by other black men, nothing will really change for the better. You could weed out every racist cop in the world and the slaughter will continue. Take a look at Chicago."

How about being black? Are you fine with that? Something tells me deep down you are not.
"Gee, one would think there are gay police officers in Toronto. In fact, we know that there are gay police officers in the Toronto Police Service. But, special interest groups like black lives matter count more, eh? BLM are bullies, plain and simple.  And Pride Toronto should be ashamed of themselves for caving."
One of them was recently caught on film screaming the word 'coon' at a black man who was speaking his mind at a rally for free speech. Apparently that's one black guy who wont be very safe in the 'blacks only' safe spaces
How did you become so obsessed with President Obama?  You write about him every single day.  Did you know that he's no longer the President?  Loathsome racist.

"Every government is prone to tyranny unless those who are governed are diligently watchful over those who are given great power and are supposed to be serving them. This law subverts our ability to be watchful.

Conflating the civil disobedience of a group who has to date never hurt or killed anyone with radical Muslim extremists is nonsense, and most certainly not the same thing. Would you have withheld Officer Darren Wilson's name from the violent and misinformed rioters in Ferguson? Quite frankly, he was in far more danger. The principles involved are of such importance that releasing the name is imperative.

While police officers don't specifically sign up to be put in unduly dangerous positions, they know danger is part of the job. I prefer to use readily available methods of protecting them that do not carry the ongoing risk of abuse inherent in codifying a lack of accountability of our police into law. Think how such a law would go over in black neighborhoods."
"Well, the love you request will not evolve from a Hillary Presidency. What ignorance! ""US Has killed more than 20 million people in 37 "" Victim Nations"" since World War II,"" www.globalresearch.ca Nov. 2015. $38 billion to Apartheid ISRAEL for weapons to be used against PALESTINIANS, CHRISTIAN and Muslim, is immoral! There is only one candidate for Peace & Love, Green Party Jill Stein. Jill2016.org according to Green Party VP Ajamu Baraka, "" OBAMA has been a moral disaster"" ""one of the worst things that has happened to African-AMERICAN people's because black issues have moved more to the right and the president hasn't been keen on seeking justice for wronged blacks"". Hillary hasn't even visited Standing Rock where Indian Tribes and friends are making a stand for their water, their sacred sites. Hawaiians know that feeling. Hillary represents corporations, banks that could care less about people and the environment. Trump is totally repulsive. Johnson, Libiterian, unaware."
"Here's Drumpfster's thinly transparently coded, vast left wing conspiracy/Black Lives Matter, remark:

– He told this Pennsylvania crowd to get a group of friends together on Election Day, vote and then go to ""certain areas"" and ""watch"" the voters there. ""I hear too many bad stories, and we can't lose an election because of you know what I'm talking about.""

He was speaking of course to his loyal xenophobes and referring to the two wankers who play ""New Black Panther Party"" dressup, standing outside a Philadelphia polling place, every four years. The media shows up for this goofy duo like it does annually for Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, PA.

The truth is, those lames have never changed anyone's vote. It's a 99% black precinct where The Donald is polling at zero-point-zero. But when he gets hammered, he can claim the election was ""stolen."""
"If the blacks want respect, they'll have to earn it.  Reminds us old WW2 era vets what earning respect means.  Still remember the infamous all Negro (that's what they were called in those days ""Running 92nd"" in Italy,  so named because those guys were quick to dropping their weapons and running back to safety behind lines.  Meanwhile our AJA boys fighting alongside were  valiantly proving themselves and earning respect.  That is the difference between earning respect by doing and just protesting."

"Now. Will Trump take up the offer by the KKK to pile up dead Mexican men, women and children and other brown South Americans at the U.S. - Mexican border? And will the ""wall"" go up? And will the wanton killings of Black Americans start up again? And will there be more mass killings? We'll see."
"There's no difference between taking your one 42(c) shot *because a judge is gay* and filing a fruitless motion to disqualify for cause *because a judge is gay*. Maybe you don't make yourself look like a fool on a 42(c), and the reason behind it may be opaque to the court, but it's obviously not opaque to the lawyer or the client.  Using that reason to pre-empt a judge is bigotry. It was then and it is now. It's also pretty monumentally stupid to pre-empt a judge to cater to your own/your client's irrational prejudices and risk winding up with a much worse judge for another reason. As you should know. 

 Do you let your clients screen out Jewish, black, and female judges too? How about the ones who are just monumentally uninterested or untrained in the type of case you're filing?"
you can't trust Scarpitti - he is in bed with the Chinese. Markham is a cesspool.  it is overrun by rude chinese.  we need to impose more than a tax in that city immediately.

"Dude you seem to be really hung up on race, as are most liberals when they run out of factual and reasoned arguments, which is pretty much always. It's their get out of jail free card, so to speak.
Once and for all; millions of us, at least half of the country, the informed half, oppose Obama because he is the leader of a hopelessly radicalized  far left Democrat party that seeks to impose it's all powerful government agenda on the American public by any means. The Constitution is nothing more than an impediment to their aims. Obama and his ilk see themselves as our betters and as a matter of policy they have one set of rules for us and one set of rules for them. RACE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.
I could give you a list of conservative black (and women)  leaders who dared to get off the liberal plantation only to be unfairly attacked in the worst personal ways. They couldn't defeat them in the battle of ideas so they take the debate to the sewer.
Any of them would dwarf Obama in a debate"

"Probably the best protest these well paid excellent athletes could do is go into high Black crime areas, without armed body guards and show unity with the poor, crime oppressed inhabitants of the 'Ghettos'. A high proportion of the worse crime cities are democratic run, and have been for decades. That would bring the spotlight squarely on to these depressed high crime areas and make the ruling elites (Dem. and Rep.) do something positive.  Funny how last year with Obama in charge it was just one guy kneeling, now with Trump as president it is a whole bunch of guys. Maybe it is all about politics and not oppression of Blacks?"
"Bishop Braxton might be right that there is insufficient 'inclusion' of Catholic. On the other hand, it might just be to the advantage of, at least, the clergy. It doesn't take much googeling to find that Catholics were a bit late to - and a bit mixed about - the process. A tardiness not totally obscure to Dr. King as well. 
A little story: In the summer of 1964 several Jesuit ""Scholastics"" in clerics and a woman religious, in habit were among the packed-congregation at the Riverside Church on Columbia U. campus for his rendition of the ""Knock at Midnight"" sermon. After the service they joined the long line of well-wishers who met with Dr. King, his wife and children. Scanning the five person line of solid black, he greeted each of them warmly as he shook their hands.  While specific words are long forgotten, his genuine pleasure at their presence was tinged with a gentle tease."

"Guys responsible for watching Organized Crime activities, including new comers to the State , were all too busy watching Kat Kealoha's uncle. That unit is now disorganized. Most police administrators never served there, lack understanding of how to use that unit. Instead of intelligence gathering, used as enforcement, which opens a door for attorney's to access files. Add the riff between  Police, FBI/AG's,  the Prosecutor's office, and the State Attorney General going after national issues, perfect environment to breed a street war between groups to control gambling, prostitution, drugs, and protection. Notice there has been an increase in shootings by afro -Americans here in Honolulu revolving around the above......that's because they are not influenced by the ""local"" way. They are the perfect soldiers, no background here, hide in the Waikiki jungle....and ""you picking on me cause I'm black."""

But I'll do you one better, spoke to a few acquaintances and found out that Trey did have a gun, his cousin took off with it along with his drugs and $ to hide them from the police. Hence the reason they had to track him down for info even though it's his cousin shot at the scene and he was there when it all went down. 

Tommy doesn't even know what Trey grabbed out that car he assumed based on what Trey was yelling about ""capping niggas"" that's why he shot him when he came back from his car the 2nd time. People tell you there going to cap you, then believe them.  Tommy shot him.  Freaked n took off. Trey cousin grabbed him saw him fading grabbed his stuff and went to hide it.  Poor female witnesses left behind to deal with the drama.  Smh"
"Goodness, I think you've badly misread my post.  I criticize Donald Trump as intellectually, emotionally and morally unfit to be President.  That has absolutely nothing to do with his being, or not being a Christian.  

VP Pence is, as I noted, an entirely different situation.  He is an ultra conservative and a fundamentalist Christian.  I'm not sure you'd find many folks who would argue otherwise.  I, indeed, disagree with Mr. Pence on many, many different issues.  That doesn't make either of us ""intellectually, morally or emotionally unfit"" to be anything...including President of the United States.  

Uniting the country? President Obama truly tried....and failed.  He had two serious disadvantages: a) a GOP Congress openly dedicated to his failure as president and b) the fact that he had an African American father and was, thereby, considered Black and hated by millions of American racists for daring to be elected to the Presidency.

I do not respect the student that lodged the formal complaint for his/her refusal to discuss the matter instead, and accept Dr. Marrus' apology. Neither do I respect Hugh Segal, the Master of Massey College for his craven and political handling of the situation. Epic fail on their part."
"Couldn't agree more. All the Haitians that have been pouring over the border ought to be offered a place here. This gesture would go a long way to our redeeming ourselves as a nation for past misdeeds. If some of these asylum seekers have been found to have been involved in criminal activity, all the better. This would simply be further indication that they were likely victims of the system, a system that preys on the disadvantaged and blacks in general."

"Douglas Saunders is right about one thing.  Blacks are better off under Obama. Where else in the world can a single Black woman have six children from six different ""Baby Daddies"" and collect $60,000 in cash cards and housing benefits annually, free medical care for her family, pay no taxes, doesn't even have to look for work let alone work, and when her children are in school they get two or three free meals a day, and free meals even in some states during summer vacation. And the ""Baby Daddies"" don't have to pay child support. Life is good in the hood."
"Police have been caught on video killing blacks for no apparent reason, or using lethal force when they were running away, not struggling with the police. When they were charged, most often they got off."
"The 11% Hispanic turnout and the 12% Black turnout numbers were not too helpful, either.

Hillary promised more of the same and they didn't show up to get it.  

I believe that the Hispanics had been promised immigration reform every four years by Obama and they didn't accept his excuses as to why  (justified though it was!) he couldn't deliver on those promises.  

Other than that she wasn't Obama, I haven't found anyone who has explained why Hillary couldn't get the blacks to the polls."
If you think racism is not alive and well in the US you have never had an honest heart to heart talk with a black man.
"Campbell may have a point about the constitutional free speech protections held by students, but there IS a supreme court backed decision that limits student's speech. This summary is succinct: ""A student’s speech... may not be censored... unless it is reasonably clear that it will ignite significant disruption or collide with the legal rights of others.""
Of course, the devil is in the term ""reasonably clear"" that it will invite ""significant"" disruption. Does hate speech meet this criteria? And what is hate speech? For example, students are known to say ""I hate you."" What if they say ""I hate Blacks""?  Or use the ""N"" word. (yes, being sensitive or politically correct here).
Balderas was taking a stand that could be interpreted as too extreme. But until his expectation is tested in a case and found to be without merit, there is no harm and no foul."
"Yeah it's ""black privilege""  to drive a car and worry that the police will racially profile you. It's ""black privilege"" to have lived as a second class citizen.

"So, then you advocate for the ""Black Bloc anarchists"" to run around and damage businesses, set cars on fire and battle with police?

You do realize that almost every black person in NA that is alive today is so because at least one of their ancestors was a slave. I'm not trying to justify slavery just pointing out that contrary to what you say it wasn't all bad. My point is that people are afraid to actually document the positive aspects of residential schools so nobody really knows to what to what extent they actually exist.
I didn't know that black people were still being oppressed. Wasn't Kaepernick making millions of dollars before pulling this stunt that led to his current state of unemployment?

"One of Obama's major contributions to America has been to make it so that, for about ten years, African American kids have grown up seeing a black President, seeing a black guy who made it to the top office of the land.

"Funny how Karma is. Benghazi happened because the GOP House rejected State's request for more security money. They knew it was their own fault, so they deflected to State, Clinton specifically, because again, Republicans are incapable of taking responsibility for anything, unless it's credit for something someone else did. 

The Trump Admin's ridiculously baffling inclusion of our best ally in the region, Chad, in the latest travel ban, resulted in Chad withdrawing all of it's troops from Niger. Days later we've got 4 dead American soldiers. 

The Trump admin refuses to talk about it, and now they're deflecting by lying about a sitting Congresswoman, and by extension, a Gold Star widow, who chose to put the call on speakerphone because her late husband's mother was in the car, along with the Congresswoman who's an old family friend. 

I've become so grateful for sane, non-lying Republicans, even though they're sadly becoming extinct."
"^^^
Fully agree... somewhat shocking to read just how little people know about history, especially the notion that the plight of the Native American population is somehow insignificant compared to the treatment of black people...  something which smug Canadians and Americans, who are quite happy to tsk tsk those in the American South, really need to sit back and think about."
"The City and County of Denver is very corrupt. It starts from the top down with democrats that are in power and have been for quite some time. These two sheriff department employees have abused their authority their entire careers and it has finally caught up with them. They should have never been hired since their family is so intertwined within Denver for decades. Their grandmother was the first black female to be promoted to captain within the department back in the early ninties. These two rose in rank quickly due to nepotism and long standing ties to Mayor Webb. What the citizens of Denver and Colorado should be asking is how can blacks hold so many key positions within the local government when blacks make up roughly one fifth of Denver's population. The Denver Sheriff Department  (DSD) has systematically been promoting blacks at a far higher rate than statistically should be possible unless there are other factors involved. The Post should investigate this, it is not an anomaly."
"You are assuming the boy would have screamed when seeing a dark skinned person.  The post talks about someone in a big black garment, covered from head to toe, without anyone in the elevator being able to see its face.

The image of something hooded black without a face showing has always denoted something dark in the Western culture, even the Devil and the henchmen.  Jung would have called it a symbol of evil, of darkness.

footage that reached us from Afghanistan.  Somehow that felt very different from the black outfits we see today.  Still, in all instances the covering of a face should not have a place in our open society."
"You were lucky then. I grew up in both a small town and rural area of southeast MO, where the Ozarks met the Mississippi River bottoms. If you weren't WASP you were ignored at best and you don't  want to know the at worst.  My third grade school teacher was my Catholic godmother. My fifth grade teacher taught us about the evils of the Catholic Church and how it killed god fearing real Christians for reading the Bible and led prayers asking that we all come know Jesus. amen. There were at least three Catholic kids in that class.  In high school my advanced French class was made to sing a rather nasty song about a monk who broke all of vows and the various ways he did so.  Crosses were still being burned in the country and a barn or two as well. The neighboring county where my family came from, had no black residents into the 1990's. Any who tried to move in, even as hired help, would be warned it wasn't a good idea to stay too long...it was always understood too well."
"RELIGION, POLITICS AND… HUMAN NATURE
Politics may be a factor in the support and legislation of Bill 62 in Quebec, but it is, obviously, an intervening variable in this equation.  The independent variable is human nature – the great majority of the citizens of Quebec, who feel uneasy, uncomfortable and… probably fearful, when faced with a number of fellow humans covered, from… head to toe, by black garments.  The miniscule number of these… strange shadows is immaterial – the psychological ghosts do not need to be numerous to terrorise some people.  We should also keep in mind that the Quebecois have just managed to free themselves from the fangs of the Catholic Church.  Thus, asking them now to make peace with other religions, we may be asking them for… too much.  Thank you.  A. C."
"The differences as I see it, Republicans look for ways that will allow the individual to escape the government dependence and become more self sufficient while Democrats are constantly looking for way to make people even more dependent on the government teat. Better know as keep them on the government plantation. Our government nanny state has done to the black community that which Racism, the Jim crow laws and segregation couldn't do, and that is destroyed the African American families. With 70% of black birth being born to single women, many of them have to virtually marry Uncle Sam to keep the financially viable. That is sad!"
"Good rationalization and clarification, Chris.  I never thought of it that way.

Your line of thinking can be applied to other areas

For example, George Wallace wasn't against ALL blacks from attending that school, just those ones.

When feminists complain that a given woman was not elected, it's not like they were against ALL women, just that one.

Etc, etc, etc..."
"Actually, speaking the truth as God has compelled me to do so in this church & state clearly how this bias against women is definitely hatred & not something else more comfortably spoken has indeed been the thing which has helped me to regain peace that I felt I didn't have.  It was when I was silent in the face of this terrible sin being done to me and all women that I had no peace.  Do you believe MLK Jr. was just some super distressed black guy, or a prophet God sent out to change the world?

Calling sin out for what it is helps and cures the damage.  Hiding sin or supporting it thru silence and cooperation is what does the damage.  

When I said do nothing against this sin, I was clear that I meant until people act & fight for change they become responsible for the sin and harm remaining in our church.  

God calls prophets not just to tell the future for God's people but to point out their sins which are angering God so that they repent and change and can heal as a body."
"""Historically, this has been women, Jews, blacks, Hispanics and LGBT.""

And Catholics, too! As historian John McGreevy points out in his latest book, AMERICAN JESUITS AND THE WORLD (Princeton University Press, 2016): The Republican Party's anti-slavery program was coupled with an anti-Catholic one. The KKK targeted three groups, especially in the South: Blacks, Jews and Catholics. Can one forget Lyman Beecher's son, Edward, a well known educator and abolitionist, who, like his father, used to weekly sermon to warn his listeners of a Catholic conspiracy and one time even donated 4,000 dollars to fight ""popery.""  One of his anti-Catholic talks led to a crowd to burn down Boston's Ursuline Convent, with the local fire dept. refusing to respond to put out the fire."
"I think you are confused.  The issue was not on how big the cake was, or its flavors or even its style.  The baker refused to make a cake for this couple ONLY because of the fact that the cake would be used as their wedding cake.  Thats it. And just so were clear, this baker had a shop. Its not like hes some freelance baker/artist doing this stuff on the side.

The FACT is, if a straight couple had sat down with this guy and asked for the exact same cake this couple wanted, this baker would have made it for them.  The ONLY reason he refused to make this cake for this couple was because he does not agree with gay marriage.  Really its no different than people in the 50's refusing to serve a black person.  Many people cited the Bible for their reasoning for that as well....didnt make it any more right.

Do you really want to live in a country where people can refuse to serve you just because they dont agree with your personal life? I sure don't."
"A caution for those of us who are tempted to label all of these transactions (and some of them certainly deserve skepticism and scrutiny) as ""money laundering"" or ""black money."" 

Bear in mind: some of the push to move assets overseas comes from Chinese business owners or citizens who seek to protect their assets from the reach of the Chinese Communist Party, and I'd be skeptical of taking the CCP's word on which funds are legitimate, and which are not. The CCP has frozen assets and expropriated the assets of dissidents in the past."
"William""  You present the very old ""America, love it or leave it"" position.  That's hardly conducive to constructive discourse.

"Why is the old hypocrite Obama outraged when he personally flew to London and bullied voters of a sovereign allied country Great Britain not to vote for Brexit, how their country will end up at the back of the line (what a symbolism from the first black President) for negotiating trade agreements, whose administration meddled in Ukraine and other elections, and his NSA monitored cellphones of Angela Merkel, Hollande, and many other friendly allies, with whom he embraced and smiled at all those G7 and G20 summits?

Vladimir Putin should have sent to him and all those incompetent Democrats copies of Kasperski anti virus with firewall so that they could protect themselves from their own ineptness. Hillary installed an unprotected server in her closet through which she (illegally) passed government emails and documents, including those from Obama that were addressed to @clintonmail.com and now they are complaining? Obama and his administration gave a new meaning to the word ""incompetent""."
"The so-called Russian Federation covers 1/6th of the world's land area, meaning a person under threat has the option of an  Internal Flight Alternative (i.e. move away from where you are not safe to some place where you can be). So a gay man in the Caucasus can relocate, for example, to, let's say, Moscow, where there is an active gay community that does not suffer persecution (although some of its members likely have been discriminated against, which is not the same thing). Surely under the benevolent leadership-in-perpetuity of Mr Putin LGBTQ folks in Mother Russia  are safe?"

"Thanks. I wasn't seeing it, because as your second post shows, he was talking to police and not black leaders.

Here's the full context:
The president met for nearly two hours with leaders of eight law enforcement groups Monday, informing them that he considered the killing of the five police officers in Dallas on Thursday “a hate crime” and that he would work actively to serve as an intermediary between minority activists and police.

“I’m your best hope,” Obama remarked at one point, according to the Fraternal Order of Police’s James O. Pasco, one of the meeting’s attendees.

“I don’t disagree,” said Pasco, who has criticized aspects of the administration’s gun-control policy. “We’re all in this together.”

Being the ""best hope"" does come across as arrogant, but it may be true. Who else out there is going to be an ""intermediary between minority activists and police."" as effectively?"
"Mike, look at all the democratic countries that have strict gun laws for decades, like Britain and Australia. Or the island of Bermuda, with 58% black population, where the police are unarmed except for a small armed response unit. None of them have been replaced by dictatorships. So don't be so paranoid and fearful of an unarmed society. 

However, I am more wary of the US now. We now have a man who is an unhinged authoritarian who will be our president and many of his supporters are armed and dangerous who may or may not do anything to enforce his diktat. I hope I am wrong but his cabinet picks and admiration of Vladimir Putin do not give me confidence."
"Here is my celebratory observation.

Yes, many Canadians are racist against black Folks.

But many are not.

And so, as the saying goes, you can see the glass half empty or half full.

But I would say that the single greatest piece of evidence that Canada is doing pretty well in this area is that Canadians, by and large, do not stereotype black folks here, instead we recognize diversity among black folks here.

And so, on the one hand, we recognize the studious and hard-working black students, be they in Windsor or Halifax, and the everyday black families in Montreal and Laval and Brampton and Edmonton, and the black folks who have risen to fame, from senators to singers, from Members of Parliament to doctors, and so on.

But in recognizing diversity here, do we not also recognize the infamous, the maladaptive, the unhelpful, as in the group ""Black Lives Matter, Toronto Chapter"" or U. of T.'s' ""Black Liberation Collective""?

Seeing the wide diversity is a good sign. There is hope."
"You respected the opinion of a racist segregationist enough to elect him to lead the ""free"" world. I put ""free"" in quotes because Trump didn't think black Americans should be free to live where they want. This is the stuff of leadership? This is what we want representing our citizenry and our country abroad? A guy who was busted for ILLEGAL housing discrimination and racial discrimination?

I wish more people would be a little less tolerant of racism today. At least when segregationist George Wallace ran for national office he didn't even earn his party's nomination. Fast forward to 2016 and Republicans not only nominated Trump, they elected the segregationist to lead us. Tells me a lot about the values of the modern Segregationist Southern Strategy... I mean Republican Party."
"Hillary's demographic strengths seem to be old men, old women and black voters.  Bernie's got the younger Democratic crowd.

"Polling of favorability shows a steep plunge for the NFL since this controversy started, especially among the core 24-59 male demographic.  Fake news outlets and TDS sufferers notwithstanding, Trump appears to have hit the narrow politics of this issue exactly right.

And as far as BLM goes, I regard them as a hate-filled organization.  So you're preaching to the choir.  But you made a general statement --- a false one --- about how blacks die, and it impugned the race as a whole.  Breaking the law often does equate with hurting innocent people, but that alone does not justify the use of deadly force.  Your suggestion that it does simply gives ammunition to those who falsely allege the institutional acceptance of unjustified deadly force."
"If your last sentence was actually true, all black-on-black murders would end today, and shooting victims , their relatives and any witnesses would actually come forward and give names and descriptions to law enforcement,  so shooters could be put in jail.

Some African Americans only have themselves to blame for that, the Code Of Silence."

What an arrogant comment. Why would the fact a Black spoke at this rally mean race has something to do with 'socialized medicine'?  What does the race of any of the speakers have to do with it?
Why beat around the bush? Do you hate blacks yes or no? Do you oppose racial discrimination towards blacks yes or no? Bet you won't answer that directly and unequivocally.
"""“And this story’s one of unimaginable sacrifice, hard work and faith in America.” sez the Donald.

"'I am going to make a speech with strong language that will contain the N-word in it, but it is not meant to offend all black people - I'm only trying to make a point about some black people, though I will be vague and speak in broad terms when using the N-word.  Even though it might unintentionally offend some people, it is my right to make the speech and I do not want anyone to critique my speech: it is my right to make it.'

The point:
Players certainly have the right to take knees during the anthem, but they fail to see that some things are sacred to a lot of people and can evoke really strong emotions.  They also fail to see their approach comes across as a blanket statement of ""F America"", where as a clear, concise message about a particular issue would have been hard for anyone to argue with.

You can't use things that are sacred to other people and then be annoyed when others become offended by it - be prepared for the consequences... (looking at you, NFL)."

99% of gun deaths (non-suicide) are caused by non-assault style weapons.  So all this focus on one type of firearm that causes the least amount of deaths while ignoring the causes of the violence is why this is pointless.

Of course, Trump’s embrace of Treason in Defense of Slavery memorials is perhaps the most important in terms of domestic politics. 

That Trump can’t help but contradict himself constantly is amusing in terms of black humor.

Trump approved of the mass murder of Muslims thanks to a falsified story of religious and racist terrorism by occupying U.S. troops crushing an independence movement.

 I mean, if this is what Trump supports, he might as well just cite the genocidal campaigns against Native Americans.

"Indeed the election of President Obama has seemed to divide our nation regarding race.  However, what it's actually done is bring the ""closet"" racists out from the shadows.

Some, Xavier, attempt to use this forum to vent their anger toward African-Americans and President Obama as our first Black President.  Then, when those persons are confronted on their slurs and degrading comments they accuse others of having ""thin skins.""

"Your racism is showing.  You may not want to bring up blacks, but I do.  Your whole argument hinges on one race being superior to ALL others.  That's racism.  To leave out blacks reflects a lack of balance in how you look at others.  Our country was founded on the idea that all men are created equal.

"Since everyone, in every country on the planet, was an immigrant at one time, except for one small place in the Middle East, or Africa, why are there these strange discussions about the value of immigrants?

Illegal, legal, black men calling slaves immigrants - one can, one can't, hate of a President putting the brakes on; and no understanding that we have a government agency whose job is to determine that. Why no discussion on what their rules are and whether they should change?

"And you think for a minute, supposing what you posit was in anyway honest, that it was 1.2 million a year?  Michael, that simply isn't possible given just the population at the time, let alone the better morals practiced by the majority of people then.

Why would anyone believe Margaret Sanger over the US government statistics?  Why would anyone believe her, given just her agenda, alone?  She was a sick and twisted individua, a racist, friend to the KKK, supporter of eugenics, who said this:
“…human weeds,’ ‘reckless breeders,’ ‘spawning… human beings who never should have been born.”  Margaret Sanger, Pivot of Civilization, referring to immigrants, African Americans and poor people.

Seems there would be a significant backlash (blacklash?), with people doing their best to destroy these offenders ... without regard to their motives.

It's the dishonest ones that are conflating this to a First Amendment issue and trying to diminish the values of those who are offended."
"The Pride organization has been hijacked by a radical black minority. If Pride cannot redeem its reputation the City should remove funding. Further I believe that Pride should be instructed that their ""parade"" permit requires they use paid duty police or a private contractor to provide traffic control and security.

If the LGBT Community wants broad public support they need to stop this backward move,"

"I didn't necessarily mean to suggest that the bishops have not talked about abortion the past 25 years.

I am saying that the bishops do not talk as tough about abortion as they do about Catholic social teaching.  Aside from a few minority bishops--what bishops have called out the ""Catholic"" politicians who support abortion?  What bishops have held them accountable?  No--it is all about ""pastoral sensitivity"" when it comes to that.

Where is the ""pastoral sensitivity"" now?  They are hypocrites.  They talk tough when talking tough is politically popular.  It is easy to call out the president in a mob of people who are supporting you.  That isn't courage.  How about calling out the politicians who support abortion with the exact same toughness---when the mob surrounding you is hostile to such talk and threatening to take away your tax exemption.  That is courage."

He DID lead the Birther movement.

He DID mock a disabled reporter.

He DID take out a full page ad calling for the wrongly convicted blacks in  NYC to be put to death.

He DID get caught discriminating against blacks in his rental buildings - TWICE!

He DID boast of grabbing women's genitalia.

He DID stiff several contractors.

He DID bankrupt a casino.

He DID lose nearly a billion dollars in one year.

He DID declare business bankruptcies - SIX times.

He DID encourage violence at his rallies.

He DID insult a Gold Star family.

He DID insult a genuine war hero.

He DID avoid paying Federal taxes for nearly two decades.

He DID cheat on all three of his wives.

His closest advisors DO  run alt-'right'/neo-nazi sites - and are quite proud of it.

He DID fill his Cabinet with the very same people who caused the problems back in W's time.

There is, of course, much more that he's done, so exactly which ""lies"" ""the media"" told about him remains a mystery."
Perhaps it would be better for him to go in a Hercules plane full of food stuffs paid for by him personally.  Then he should leave as soon as the plane is unloaded and leaves.

"Michael, why you read Z and not more Catholic lefties like me is also disturbing. I never seek this particular blogger out. Priests should have better things to do than be Catholic Trolls.

Trump seems to have no inner life, which explains remarks such as these.

I never read Erick any more than I read Z, but he may have ulterior motives in predicting a GOP blood bath. Expect this to be a call to arms to right wing and pro-life fundraisers.

Liberals live in several bubbles. There is the Sanders/DSA/Green bubble, the neo-liberal bubble, a very small Christian left bubble and separate Catholic left bubble (which may interact with the socialists),the femiist bubble, the union bubble, the African America church bubble and the Latino bubble. None of us look at Fr. Z."
"Umm, I haven't forgotten those riots, but you're reading comprehension needs some work. Again, my family didn't immigrate to this country until the 20th Century.  My grandparents were born in Ireland.  The riots of 1863 to which you refer are no more their responsibility than slavery.  They weren't even here.  Neither was I. I have no moral imperative to accept blame for something over which I had no control, nor did anyone in my family. I am only responsible for injustice that I have the ability to affect. An innocent young black man killed on the street for no reason other than his skin color.  Now, that I must rise up against. Because it's happening today. That is the only true Irish opposition to oppression that I can offer because it is all that I have to give."
"Pot calling the Kettle black ? Let's look at the statistics from the Interior Minister of Germany for 2016, 2017! Are you siting 2015 before the migrants arrived? 

Interior Minster's own words from their own report!

""The number of suspected crimes by refugees, asylum-seekers and illegal immigrants rose to 174,438 in 2016 — an increase of 52.7 per cent, according to the interior ministry.

“This is not something to gloss over,” Thomas de Maiziere,  the interior minister, said as he presented the figures. “Those who commit serious offences here forfeit their right to stay here.
The proportion of foreign suspects, and migrants in particular, is higher than the average for the general population.
Migrants accounted for 8.6 percent of all crime suspects in Germany in 2016, up from 5.7 percent the previous year.
Crimes motivated by Islamism increased by 13.7 percent, the report showed. 

% of Muslims goes up so does the crime rate, that's the correlation.  Do you know of Rotherham? Madness"
"Does anyone see the hypocrisy of how this situation is being handled in comparison to the black live matter protests? In the Oregon situation we have individuals protesting at a public federal facility closed for the winter, not harming anyone or anything. Response by the government, isolate, contain use deadly force! With the black live matter people, they block public roads, illegally detain motorist, assault private citizens and law enforcement, disrupt private business and destroy property. The response by the government, they have the first amendment right of free speech and protest! What is wrong with this picture?"
"The anarchists who perpetrate the violence we've been seeing are not liberals...they are, as they self-proclaim, anarchists.  I condemn their actions of violence.  Using their actions to demonize liberals is disingenuous at best.  As a life-long liberal I defend freedom of speech and support PEACEFUL protest.  Those ""justice warriors"", waring black, with faces covered with ski masks, in no way represent me or my beliefs.  I am a self-acknowledged liberal and proud of it.  I post my ""liberal ideas"" under my own name.  I notice you and virtually all who attack liberalism and liberals, do so anonymously.  We've all had this discussion before, but I must again say, I find such anonymity cowardly.  If you believe in what you write, be willing to claim it.

"Again, you are completely ignoring the history of racism in Hollywood.

"Not very funny that comment about mass shooting.   Is not some of what you are complaining about brought on by the fact that some of our most violent areas are where it is mainly minorities living?   Also, I remember a certain person that Katie ordered murdered because of the mere hint that he might have a gun in a pocket.    You do have control over the likelihood of being stopped and frisked, or pulled over for a busted tail light.  Blacks have more control over their lives than they want to admit.   If you do not want to be taken for thugs, do not act as thugs."
"`Odd that the article fails to mention the reason Chad pulled their troops out.

"Padre Reese, the real question in these polls whether examining  RC voting or ""evangelical"" voting, is this: how do you define the terms? Take it from a non-RC, those ""evangelicals"" (by now a near meaningless theological term having been so stretched by the media) who overwhelmingly voted for Mr. Orange, rarely darken the door of a church. They are self-selecting in their description, having already attempted to monopolize the term ""Christian"".

We in a mainline church are a little easier to measure given our smaller numbers and cohesion. As to you RC, are the pollsters measuring any baptized RC, who is a cultural Catholic? Never at Mass, no check in the mail, in church when niece marries or when Uncle Vito dies, but otherwise never. If that is a Roman Catholic, then you folks are like our Jewish friends who can be agnostic but fully Jewish (well not in the minds of the black garbed ultra-Orth. but that's another story)."
"This is merely my experience, but I have never seen or participated in a BLM march in response to a police killing. However, between Memorial Day and a few weeks past Labour Day,  my Church has a march every Friday at 7:00 pm, through our South Side parish. The rout is set in consultation with the police, generally, who let our priest know which blocks have been most tense and problematic. We chant any number of things, and ""Black lives matter,"" is one of the prominent refrains. Also, ""Put the guns down,"" ""Save the babies,"" ""We love you, your are brothers, we love you, your our sons,"" and various other such things. Towards the end of this Summer, we went to the house of a neighborhood gang leader, to call him out, and offer support for him to change. We stopped at the local precinct house, to applaud, bless, and pray over the officers last month. And there have been larger marches in the city, last Good Friday, for instance, and a few others since then.

"So former Democrat President candidate John Edwards was misunderstood for his temptations and results thereof? Have an affair while his wife was fighting cancer, then have a child with the other woman and try even harder to hide the kid? He initially denied being the father. 

Where's the rationale in that - coming from a man who wanted the country to believe him as vice president or president? Edwards wanted the public to ignore his situation, since he was trying to hide it, but that eventually blew up in his face. 

Thank you for agreeing with my premise, but your second sentence fails miserably."
"Identity politics is far from declining. In fact,  it’s on the rise, here in our complicated country, the US and elsewhere.

AfriForum has every right to protest imo, just like the Fallists have every right. It’s about how you go about it. Having said that, if Black Monday want to gain the support and sympathy of the nation, they cannot allow the old guard to display the symbols of the past. It will sink them."

There is a half-page add on page 47 in the program from the Diocese of Youngstown that includes the name of Bishop Murry.  Murray was not listed as a presenter at the Congress.

Murry also chairs the bishops’ Committee on Catholic Education as the administration of The Catholic University of America continues to ignore the censure imposed by the American Association of University Professors in 1990 of abuse of professors."

Your rhetoric will fire up the hearts of those who are weary of crime but watch more true life crime shows for the unattended consequences of actions taken in frustration or anger by private citizens with good intentions such as yours. I don't want a person who lacks common sense around me or my kids playing a wannabe cop. A license plate and photo was more than sufficient for the police to ID the people.

"For the one thousandth time: The most important trait an NFL QB must have to be successful is the ability to read a defense pre-snap. Cutler can do it, Kaepernick can't/won't/doesn't do it.  He's a one-read-and-run QB. RG3 has the same issue and wouldn't you know it, he's also unemployed. The ""but the NFL allows wife beaters, drug addicts, and other criminals, but not a socially conscious black man"" excuse doesn't work here. When players commit the crimes listed above, they only embarass themselves, their teams, and their fans. Kaepernick took a very strong social stance and executed it in a way that alienated millions of paying fans all around the country. That takes it from a team issue to a league/owner issue. Just as Kaep had/has a right to take his stand, the owners have the same rights to not employ him and in the process remind the other players that playing in the NFL is a privledge."

 ""Black comedy, also known as black humor or dark comedy, is a sub-genre of comedy and satire where topics and events that are usually treated seriously are treated in a satirical manner while still being portrayed as the negative events that they are. Typical targets are death, (mass) murder, suicide, blackmail, (domestic) violence, disease, insanity, handicaps, environmental disasters, famine, fear, child pornography/abuse, drug abuse, rape, castration, war, terrorism, racism, sexism, homophobia, bestiality and line-cutting. ""  Please note that ""insanity (mental illness) is one of the topics included.

 Additionally, if you intend to lecture me on ""black humor"", please first become familiar with its definition."

Ethnicity should not be either a crutch or an excuse.

As she was monitoring Facebook this summer, she found a public comment by a senior director at the company in an otherwise civil discussion by one of his employees about Black Lives Matter.

“You’re a f------ Libtard a------,” the director injected, using his profile that clearly and repeatedly identifies himself as an employee of the firm.

In fact, the person he aimed that comment at was so offended by the intrusion into the conversation and the coarse nature of it that he challenged the director on representing Akima that way.

So Briskman flagged the exchange to senior management.

"Does it matter who tells a story worth telling, as long as it reaches the public domain?  John Howard Griffin wrote ""Black Like Me"" in 1961.  He was not black.

Examples of media bias?

1. Selectively reporting protests. I favour liberal abortion access for Canada, but city drivers know anti-abortion activists hold periodic protests. The media ignore them - yet activists from Black Lives Matter (and various minority/gender groups) get covered all the time. Why so SELECTIVE?

2. The South China Morning Post investigating, YEARS before ANY Canadian journalists, the connection between Vancouver house prices and overseas money.

3. CENSORING away race/ethnicity identities with crime, EMPHASIZING them when good works are done.

"Thank you Sir (Victor Edwards) for understanding the problem. Its always interesting to see the demographic makeup of the people that have a negative post in relation to the issues at hand. I imagine its the same for woman when talking about inequality to men who have no idea what its like to be a woman, so they think she is only interested in complaining, should be happy to have her job, and should not worry about being treated fair. These players use this platform to affect the multitude and make these spoiled pampered people watching experience a small portion off what its like to be in uncomfortable situations you don't choose to be in. The biggest difference is they can turn their tv off or not to watch the NFL, but the players can not turn of their ethnicity. So who are the truly pampered people here? Some things mean more than money. We all want the protesting to end, just for different reasons. They wanna be comfortable again, black people wanna live without the inequalities!"

America has had quite a few ""revolutions"" over time. There was the original War of Independence of course. But we also fought over slave ownership, women's and minority's rights to be equal and be able to vote and own property. More recently people revolted and ended the insanity of the Vietnam debacle. We even got rid of a corrupt president along the way. Pretty revolutionary.
I'm inclined to go with the revolution. It's really just history finally playing out and America electing it's first female president and you know what? I think we will survive just like we survived our first black president. Vote smart...."

That is what we are enmeshed in at the moment with the NFL and their totally false precept of ""social injustice"" and Cops killing blacks.  Every last bit of it is based on hot air and not an iota of factual information.  What makes it more interesting is that the simpletons accepting and spreading the lies are some of the most highly paid in the country.

.
The whole grievance is centered around so-called police brutality against blacks.  There have been some cases of police killing someone who, on the surface, 'appeared' to not be a threat. But put yourself in their shoes. They are targets. They wear a uniform and are hated by all kinds of criminals from gang members to drug dealers and prostitutes.  This has to run thru their mind every minute of every hour of every day. They are human and not robots, so they 'react' with very human reflexes and emotion.  The biggest victims of violence against blacks, unfortunately,  is by other blacks and not cops.  Who will take a 'knee' for all those victims?"
"Allaha: ""Nobody said 'all.'""

You did, but maybe you're not aware that you did. These are your words: ""In 2013, A BLACK was six times more likely than a non-black to commit murder."" (Emphasis added.)

Of course you didn't mean ""all blacks,"" but by your choice of words, you imply that ANY black -- and by extension, ALL blacks -- are six times more likely to commit murder. The further implication is that, since we can't trust some blacks, we shouldn't trust any.

Words are powerful, and we have to be careful about how we use them. The issue isn't what you meant to say but how your message is perceived by others. As a reader, I'm trying to give you feedback on how your words came across to me and perhaps to others, too."
As sad as the events were in VA and the unfortunate loss of life. On the other hand in the perpetual Democrat Chicago eight people were killed over the weekend -not a peep in the fake news press. Only three of the eight deserved that fate. That three met their maker by invading the home of a lawfully armed citizen who was protecting his life and property. Guess none of those black lives mattered even to blacks.

"If I was sitting at a table with any black people present, and a person with the name or title ""Master"" was introduced, the same ironic thought that flashed into Marrus' head would go through mine as well. And it would occur to everyone else present also. Oh yes it would.

Marrus was however stupid enough to blurt it out in a clumsy attempt at humor.

The hypersensitivity shown by the reaction extends into the tech world by the way. In various communications protocols between electronic devices, the terms ""master"" and ""slave"" were used to accurately describe which device initiated a data transaction and which device responded.

"Respect is not a God given right, as far back as I can remember it had to be earned.

The number one cause of death of black men between the ages of 18 and 34 years is black on black HOMOCIDE!!!!!  How can they expect anyone to respect them when they in turn do not even respect each other. These millionaire football players are completely out of touch. If a police officer never killed another black person, there would not even be a little dent in their plight. The football players need to give back more than 60 seconds on their knees to their brothers. It will take generations of hard work, they need to be active in addressing the black problem"

No, Antifi and other protestors marching against neo Nazis and Klansmen are not ""just as bad"" as the Nazis and Klansmen. They are standing up to hate.

"In 2013 Marble said:

“I’ve never had better barbecue and better chicken and ate better in my life than when you go down South and you, I mean, I love it. Everybody loves it.”

There are plenty of genetic markers that influence each and every racial and ethnic segment of the population of Earth... Why did the Senator single out African Americans?

"Your post is full of inconsistency:

You believe abortion is immoral and that the Church is right to call it sinful, but you believe the state should not legislate against it.  I fully understand not legislating against ALL moral wrongs.  Even Aquinas, in his wisdom, saw that.  But We're not talking about a minor moral wrong.

You not only think the state should not legislate against it, but seem to celebrate the state's permitting it.  Why should someone celebrate the state's allowing a seriously immoral act?

You say, ""I believe abortion needs to stay completely legal & readily available to all women because countries cannot be expected to legislate morality & remain free for all religions.""  But religion need not have anything to do with it.  Ordinary morality suffices.  You may be tempted to say, ""But we can't force our morals on everyone.""  That would be false.  We prohibit murder, theft, discrimination against blacks and women, etc. etc.  . . . all based on morality."
"""Cody said a records search on Pirate at the time revealed 'numerous convictions for sexual assaults out of California and New Mexico.'""
We know law enforcement for rape is fraudulent and complicit in India, Africa, and Asian countries, among others. But mountains of evidence indicate it is not considered a serious, violent crime in the US either. Processing rape kits wasn't even a national issue until recently when enough women (a small number) took law enforcement positions of power and asserted our safety priorities. This is an example of why women must plan, work toward and take on leadership positions. Maybe our new legislature will vote yes on a second opportunity to pass a bill that requires holdout AK police departments to immediately get their shelved sexual assault kits tested. But we have to outvote all the rapists and sympathizers in Alaska in order to elect ourselves an honest, equal rights majority caucus in Juneau who will finally enact laws that women and children need."

Let us never forget that race based slavery was just a business model with rape as a profit center. These are the issues that caused our Founding Fathers to revolt against Britain. Britain abolished race based slavery and that was more than our Founding Fathers could stand. It caused them to rape their female slaves so they didn't have to pay for adult black slaves. That was a cost benefit decision.
"How to tell a collectivist...

"Well they do, it just isn't a one for one ratio.  Additionally, it seems only black killings are being protested.  But we have come to the $64,000.00 question that needs to be answered, if possible, empirically, are the protests justified?  What number of the 200 are non-justifiable and how do they compare to non-justifiable killings with other races (Honestly, I don't like to even use the word ""race"".)  Then in turn, figuring out if the non-justifiable are statistically meaningful.  Of course, if it is me or a family member, ""statistically meaningful"" is irrelevant."

"#1) The problem with protesting during the national anthem is if you had asked people before all of this started what the flag and anthem represented, an overwhelming number of people would have responded that they represent this great country and the people who have sacrificed to make it great.  So by kneeling, regardless of their purpose, it is taken as a slight to the country and those who sacrificed.
#2) It seems to me that they are protesting the RESULT of the problem rather than the ROOT of the problem.  They complain that police are unfairly targeting blacks.  Why?  It could have to do with the fact that blacks only make up 15% of the population in the US but commit over 50% of the crime.  That is an absolutely staggering statistic.  It's human nature to profile when the numbers are that overwhelming.  The ROOT of the problem lies in black neighborhoods where the education system is horrible and jobs are scarce.  That's where the efforts and resources need to be focused."

"What a sad end to this officer's career. I highly doubt she went to work looking to kill a black guy. She made a mistake and now needs to pay the price. 

That being said, it is a sad day in this country that this situation came to this. If they tased him too early when he first started disobeying the orders, he sues the police for excessive use of force. Instead, they let this continue and it gets to the point where the officer is on edge and makes a mistake. Granted, she made the mistake and has to own up to it. But the truth of the matter is if you FOLLOW AN OFFICERS ORDERS, you will be fine. In almost every shooting, it always starts with a suspect not following the officers commands.

If you don't like the officers commands and think they are unjust, follow them anyways and then hire an attorney after the incident is over. Why is that common sense approach so difficult? I don't get it. Just respect the job the police have to do and comply. It is really that simple."

For one thing I didn't cause the minority birth explosion and the lack of interest in education as a general rule but I know I'm paying for it. I really am sorry for those that feel they were robbed of something and that feel cheated because of some pigment differences but I have noticed prejudice even among the black community towards the lighter skinned people so called black race so it isn't just the European immigrants that you can blame. A lot of inroads have been made and a many fine African decedents have done very well but it didn't help to flood the system. Europe doesn't have the problem why does America?"

Also, learn something about black identity Christianity, maybe have some black friends you're close enough with to regularly have dinner in their homes, then you might be able to make an intelligent comment about Wright. The short of it is, bombastic comments are used to motivate people to overcome and succeed. Every black kid growing up had an uncle, grandfather, or pastor, who made such bombastic statements as a means to motivate them.

"There are two distinct and polar opposite reasons for why a very broad cross section of our nation is coming out against trump vs those who stated negatively re Obama.
The racists and bigots who hated that a black man was president gave no time for Obama to preside.  Their hatred was based exclusively on Obama's skin color and the false narrative that Obama was a Muslim and not an American (see trump's many birther statements etc).
On the other side, we all hoped that trump would catch on to public office and public accountability.  He has failed- miserably.  Now he has dismissed his two economic advisory councils- the CEOs that he heralded as his critical support to bring jobs back.  At first, he said many other CEOs were lined up after (the black) CEO of Merck resigned. Then he dropped both groups.  We can only surmise that trump's small ego is more important to him than economic growth.

"There were about two hundred nut cases in that room .  They have nothing in common with Trump supporters . You are sadly misguided if you think those two hundred represent the over 62 million who voted for Trump.   Where's your video of the Black Lives people marching chanting they want dead cops now ?  Or the countless video's of their supporters looting and destroying property ?  Or how about the video of all those Clinton and Sanders supporters destroying property in Portland because they are mad Trump won ?   It's very sad that you think those two hundred nuts are part of Trumps supporters because they are not. Since you believe they are , it explains your insane left field comments .  Regardless of what you believe , it's over now . Trump is your president for the next four years ."
I'm not so sure about that. Yusra Khogali has been caught on film hurling- quite literally screaming across a crowd of people- racial slurs at a black man who was giving a speech that she didn't agree with. She retains all her positions and prominence within university life. Sort out the double standard on that one?
"Tompaine, I don't mean to sound insensitive, and I do know that all of people of color experience incidents of racial insensitivity or out and out racism during their lifetimes, but I just don't buy the idea that (in your case) Mexicans are subjected to racism on a daily basis. I can't argue that you don't perceive it as such, but I can question the validity of your perception. There are whole departments at the U of O where the professors do little more than identify racism in everything but the milk we drink."
"Like the other criminal you some times employ the non Canadian Lord Black, why are you paying this man who defended child porn and claimed to have been on the NAMBLA mailing list, as if it was a joke, to give his opinion about anything. He has not been relevant in Alberta politics since he made those comments in public, and no his apology was not satisfactory."
His experience as a black man in America might be a bit different from the hundreds killed at routine traffic stops every year

"Ukraine was Obama and Hillary's big play. What does the average American care about it and Russia's claim to Crimea? Little, I suggest. Nor does the average American care about who runs Syria. They'll care much more that Islamic State is running rampant in the country, and so they should. Again, up to this point events in Syria reflect the foreign policies of Obama and Clinton.

You can hypothesize all you like about what Trump may get from it personally, but it doesn't change the fact that he's staked out a strong foreign policy position that could attract many American voters."
"Paul - After Trump deports all the illegal aliens, millions of African Americans will have jobs which will save trillions in welfare spending.  How cool is that?

""I want to apologize to Michael Johnson....  Michael and I began this unique event as friends, but the build-up to the race has left the friendship strained.

""I have tremendous respect for Michael's athletic ability and I hope that the injury he sustained is not season-threatening. I wish him a speedy return to competition.""

"I love the argument that because Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot oppressed people worse than a given oppressive authoritarian state that it somehow proves that it is okay. It is like saying ""rattle snakes aren't poisonous. You've obviously never been bitten by a black mamba!"""
"Dr. Hanson is absolutely correct- out of wedlock births in the black community is over 71%.   I'll say that again: over 71%.   No one's ""racism"" caused that.  Have you looked at what bringing up a child in a fatherless, single parent environment does to a child?  Do you know the impact that getting pregnant outside of marriage- and especially before graduating high school- does to break cycles of poverty? Of course you haven't, because 'racism,' right?
.
What're more: major black communities in Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, etc. have had absolutely 100% Democrat-controlled (and the majority of them black) city councils, police chiefs, school board leadership and local politicians for decades.  Again- he is absolutely correct: they're frustration is easily taken out on the mythical ""institutional racism"" out there, somewhere. It is much easier doing that than it is electing Conservative and Libertarian leadership who takes them off government control."
"They don't?

I never seem to hear liberals condemn the uncivil means and tactics used by Black Lives Matter.

I don't exactly call ""What do we want....Dead cops"" civil.  I heard no liberal condemn that, nor did I hear our president at that time condemn that."
"Sorry, Dude, but the criminals are living in a cesspool.  You can too if that's how you feel, but don't include any of us law abiding citizens."

"Cheering for the death of human beings, a true humanitarian.......     Punishment/correction of course.   Death, the irreversible sentence - will never get my support.   Some state gun laws exonerate murder only if the shooter 'felt' threatened, even if the other person in completely innocent.    Seeing the paranoia and bigotry nationwide on display show just how insane such laws have become.  Grab a gun, everybody for themselves.

Interesting idea for the city to pick up the tab.   That may still happen.......     Maybe inner city black neighborhoods will sue for a failure of police to fight crime in their neighborhood as well.   They should challenge the institutional failure to control violent crime.   We'll sacrifice soldiers lives to save victims of violence overseas, but can't muster the moral outrage  to stop it in our own nations neighborhoods.    ""Ah who cares, they don't look like my family, the get what they deserve"" (satire)."
Black kid with machete had fight with ex-con in convenience store; girl friend egged on the ex-con to run over the kid according to what she told police.
The problem with much of the criticism is that it comes from the anti-Trumpers who only have negative opinions about everything he says. These are the same people who would never ever criticize Obama. Remember Obama could not get himself to condem Black Lives Matter even when they called to kill police.
"Keeping jobs in America rather than overseas will naturally push up the minimum wage because they will need to pay more to get good workers which will help blacks and the low skilled.

Forcing minimum wage laws onto companies is socialism!"
"What an incredible farce for Canada to put in everyone's face it's the epitome of inclusion in these troubled times. You're about 50 years behind the U.S. and the reason inclusion looks so natural in Canada is that the majority rules with an iron fist and you're doing things that wouldn't be tolerated in much of the western world.
And you have the audacity to criticize  groups like Black Lives Matter?"
If you call a black semi automatic a assault rifle it scares the jury much more than if you call it just a rifle.
"I think that the writer had expectations that could never be satisfied in a law firm. I went through the process a number of years ago and was astounded to be the only one who wanted to take time off on the High Holidays not long after my articling year began. This was not a giant firm, but rather a medium one that specialized in one area of law. There was not one other Jewish person there, whether lawyer, student or support staff. My family name had been Anglicized by immigration authorities generations before. The writer seemed to want the work and the status and to keep on with her sport,  but not what went along with it, like wearing a suit every day. Every workplace has its norms, like the suit. It is the openness to people from other backgrounds and cultures that has to change. Not easy when legal culture replicates itself with each new crop of lawyers with shared schools, social norms and more. Being black is not the only way not to fit in. Old school WASP culture limits this."
"After reading the article, one is made starkly aware that this piece is precisely where it belongs-- in 'Opinion'.

An opinion is an imagined truth.

Perhaps this emotional exercise-- in this kind of identity politics (racism-lite)-- would also have us believe that the terrorist-in-waiting organization Black Lives Matter is a promoter of reconciliatory conversation, an agent of peace."
"the  Pride Parade  organizers played politics and lost

the Parade is about gay pride
they distracted us from the message of gay Pride by inviting Black Lives Matter as the honoured group
which staged a protest and held up the Parade for 30 minutes

serves them right for pushing a political agenda
i can see inviting Gay Black Lives Matter but why BLM?"
"Why should people not resist an illegal arrest, supposedly because the court system will straighten it all out, that's really funny. Cops plant evidence, lie in their reports and are usually ""investigated"" by their buddies, prosecuters want to stay on the good side of the people that keep them busy and look at how the courts have allowed almost any scenario by cops doing illegal searches and seizures. Will this Utah cop be prosecuted, how about the three other losers that knowingly allowed him to make an illegal kidnapping. 
Why did Watt's burn, an inebriated Black man ran so the cops put a rope around his neck and kicked and beat him, then got off. What about Gray, he ran and the cops killed him, they all got off. Why wou;ld any Black male submit to arrest when you can go on utube and see any number of handcuffed guys being kicked and beat. Not in AKyousay, how about that legless man killed at a pullout on the Kenai, now a fellow in Seward dead by cop. Only rich people will ever get"
"You want a local example? How about Teressa Raiford, a media favorite. Everything is about race with her. When her nephew, Andre Dupree Payton, was shot dead at 2 a.m. on a Northwest Portland street, she blamed it on “neglect” by Portland Public Schools. (Witnesses said he was killed by young, black males.)

Perhaps she was disappointed that police didn't shoot him. Attorneys would have been standing by."
"The first black woman has been brought in KPMG to envisage the trust of people, what was the need for KPMG to play a race card. Are they now trying to hide their behemoth corruption behind the curtains of racism?"
"And blacks can't play sports. In rare cases, suddenly, there's a difference. Please tell us more. We know that sometimes juveniles (the word used when they have allegedly committed a crime, not ""minor"" or ""child,"" which are used when they have sex with someone who is not a minor or child) are charged as adults. Explain to us how this works. Tell us all about children, how infants are the same as 17 year olds, etc."
"No, you misunderstand, Larry. I'm not suggesting that we need efforts to compensate for past injustices -- I'm suggesting that we need efforts to correct for CURRENT injustices. Voting rights are still being denied based on spurious suggestions of voter fraud (which is virtually non-existent, except in the fevered minds of Republican operatives). Some Republicans have even been courageous (or stupid) enough as to admit that their efforts to restrict voting -- which disproportionately affect (otherwise legitimate) Democratic voters -- are intended to help Republicans win elections. Similarly, it's obvious that there is widespread discrimination against black Americans in policing and other areas. These injustices require attention, and won't be cured by hiding behind the notion that we're beyond race."
Nostalgic for the days when circulating mimeographed cartoons at work about American blacks being lynched was considered just good fun?

"Did the black slaves have an individual right?  Show us the evidence if you dare,  versus your editorial comment and again, a belief not based on fact."
"So you are drawing the conclusion that the genetic makeup of an American black, centuries removed from the African roots, allows you to compare African culture to black American culture?   

Do you assume that all black people are genetically pre-disposed to tribal violence seen in Africa?

Do you realize that this stereotyping is one form of racial bias?"
"Funny you should bring up ""those people"" who planned to flee Trump's US.  

I ran across this quote from a letter Abraham Lincoln wrote in 1855 when the Know-Nothings (the American Party) feared for the country's safety due to the immigration of Irish Catholics.

“As a nation, we began by declaring that ‘all men are created equal.’ We now practically read it ‘all men are created equal, except negroes.’ When the Know-Nothings get control, it will read ‘all men are created equal, except negroes and foreigners and Catholics.’ When it comes to this I should prefer emigrating to some country where they make no pretense of loving liberty—to Russia, for instance, where despotism can be taken pure, and without the base alloy of hypocrisy.”

Lincoln decided not to emigrate to Russia and stuck around to help ""negroes"" into the created equal category.  Unfortunately ""foreigners"" are still on the list, though we've managed to replace Catholics with Muslims."
"Is that why Trump got more of the Female, Black, Asian, and Latino vote than Romney, Roy?"
"Mr Trump spent 8 years of the Obama administration flying around the world in a 747 with his name spray painted down the side telling anyone who would listen that the first black president was born in Kenya.  “I have tremendous detectives in Honolulu,” he said.  “We will have a tremendous announcement,” he said.  “Very soon!” He said.  That was the biggest fake news story since the bugging of Trump Tower.  Oh but now he doesn’t like fake news?  Mr. Trump is a foppish bufoon.  When you live by the sword you die by the sword.  Which is very difficult with such tiny hands . . ."

"Please cite some examples. One of the members of his transition team is black, and he has always employed blacks. I never read  he was a racist until he ran for President."
"Interesting comment. Do you have any stats showing how may black men were shot by police as well as stats of how many black males were shot by other black males? 
The ugly truth is there is a great deal of crime related to black males in America. There are also a great many black women who are raising their kids on their own because the fathers have run off to do whatever.
When you see a black athlete being praised for their on field accomplishments it seems the mom always gets the thanks, as they should, but you seldom see the dad in the picture. When a black youth is killed it seems the mom is always their to be interviewed. Seldom is the dad to be found.
America doesn't have a police violence problem, it has an absentee father problem."

"You and Trump belong on a  No-Fly list. Any others you'd like to ""banish?"" Natives? Mexicans?Blacks?"
"As a democrat and a black man we go dress up in kkk uniforms shouting we love trump and the funny thing is people start hating trump and republicans. It's easy to get so pissed off and march and riot. It's so easy to get a balm crowd together too. We will destroy America from the inside. We own ADN and CNN and the news. As long as we stage it we can get people to assassinate Rubio trump and others. It's so fun as democrat life. We get away with murder like Tupac says. Look at Hillary Clinton, she did and we loved for it too."
"And you  trust Obama and his rendition of false history for your facts. His entire criminal justice commission was for only one purpose. Let thousands of black felons out of prison based on presidential lies about ""targeted"" races. Even the DOJ can't fine enough lies to cover for Obama and his racism.  So your solution is to only allow arrests of criminal based on their percentage in the population instead of the crimes they commit? Hope you are never allowed  to sit a jury."
"If witness testimony related there was gun fire and a black man ran from the crowd, should they not stop black men who were nearby and fit the description.  Ignore them simply because they are black and may feel inconvenienced?  Is it now any time a black man is questioned about an incident it's done out of racism and deceit?  Had you been in that crowd, you wouldn't want the police to identify and arrest the shooter.  Do you think they just announce themselves?  Hey, it was me, not that black guy.  This world is going a little top heavy on labeling any encounter racism and profiling.  My vote is for the cops to just say screw it, they can pick your dead body up after the fact and label it an accident, save not to insult anyone."
Tell us about how great blacks had it before the so-called Great Society ruined it for them. Don't forget citations.
"In the CBS 4 video at the top of this article, the (black) reporter speaks as if he's proven guilty. There would be a HUGE uproar if this was a black man."
"As the blacks that could have just gone to a lunch counter that catered to blacks to get that answer.

"We have seen, time and again, that the government only listens to the voice of violence. It takes serious disruption to get their heads out of the trough long enough to see the unhappiness. I feel for the current mayor because he is reaping the whirlwind the ANC sowed. We all know that salvation for the South African economy lies in SMME business development, but all the initiatives from government - like the Small Business Development Department are only interested in helping BLACK entrepreneurs, prey to the same racism as the past. So many entrepreneurs are leaving SA because they are the wrong colour and get the message that there is no future for them here because of the actions of others decades and centuries ago. Ironically the best black graduates also leave these shores. Each that goes takes a fragment of the hope for jobs for the people in these backwaters of hopelessness. It is high tragedy."
"That is how the democrat's propaganda machine works

Few simple themes for the simple minded.

Every Canadian should feel safe in this country and be shown respect for our many cultures and religions, is this really a case where only Canadians should look at themselves in the mirror and ask some questions?"
"They are all black. Do you know any of them personally. They were rightfully elected to the highest offices in our country. Your racist junior high name calling makes capable of judging them.  You may not like what you hear but to judge them based on race is as far out of line as you thinking you could run for a congressional seat and win.

"It is no longer GAY Pride. We are merely hosts to a festival to which we are just spectators.  The whole affair could now be moved to Exhibition grounds if ""pride"" is all there is.

I can't imagine BLM will give up domination of Pride without a fight, and certainly not to any group they do not approve of.  They have stolen it and are not going to let it go.

"Why is denying the Jewish Holocaust of 75 years ago more objectionable than ""race-baiting and misogyny""?

"I don't know if everyone heard Obama during his campaigning but I heard the threats being made by a community organizer regarding how he was going to transform this country. I took those threats seriously.

But this is Canada, not the U.S. Their rise and their Trump clone candidate will spend years in the political wilderness until another Harper comes and hushes them. Actually O'Leary won;t stick around that long. He'll lose then go back to his businesses. Pull a Belinda Stronach basically."
"So hey, Leah, why don't you write about your indignation of the new left-wing fascist violence upon anything right-wing or Trump? You must have some indignation here.

Hollywood elites like Madonna wanting to blow up Washington? Sarah Silverman calling for a military overthrow of the government? Or how about the Black Bloc violence in Washington on Inauguration Day or the recent anti-free-speech riot that recently occurred against conservative UK journalist Milo Yiannopoulos, on UC's Berkley Campus, the very home of 60s free-speech?

None of his is protest anymore. It smacks of left wing calls and provocations to greater violence - especially for the masses of those easily-swayed weak-minded lefties . So how do you explain or rationalize that to your little children? Or do you even bother? Too adult for them, right?

That all makes 'cuck' sound like a funny word in a child's nursery rhyme."
"It's interesting that you can't tell the difference between discrediting someone based on the colour of their skin vs. the (mental) capacity to lead. Of course there are those people who dislike Obama because they view him as an ineffective leader. I'd tend to agree with the view that Obama missed out on major opportunities to repair some of the damage in America's social fabric that was so evident in Va. last weekend, made serious foreign policy blunders, and left many campaign promises unchecked. None of that is because he's black. But I also know that there were large swathes of the political right who faulted him for his blackness.
Hillary lost because she's unlikable. After nearly three decades of Bushs and Clintons, Americans wanted change. I don't know why they thought Donald would be that change, but I do know that Democrats need a better message than 'have you seen the other guy?' if they hope to make any progress in 2018 and beyond."

"19,000/32,000 gun deaths in the US were suicides.  Where are most suicides?  In Asia and Eastern Europe.  Most common method?  Hanging.  They should outlaw ropes.

Most civilized people do not like guns.  We don't like bombs either, but thank God the US has them.  Why?  Because if the bad guys have all the bombs....  Same deal with guns.

Most gun homicides in the US are about personal conflicts, not the mere ownership of a gun.  The majority of homicides with guns in the US are committed by Black people killing other Black people.  That's sheer numbers, not rates per person.  Considering that Blacks make up about 13% of the population, maybe we need to be focusing on something else, not the guns."

You are pathetic and an embarrassment to you and your team.  I spent 18 month in Iraq fighting for this country and I will not be disrespected by a bunch of over paid millionaires.  The issues facing the black community have nothing to do with the police do your research before you protest and make an ass of yourself.  I will not watch another NFL game or buy another product promoted by this league.  When are the leaders of these teams going to hold people to a higher standard.  I hope the NFL goes bankrupt.
"In another context, you would scream “racist!” if someone called Brown or Martin “boy.” Yet you refer to them as children.

They are two different individuals, involved in two very different encounters. I have no sympathy for Brown. Clearly, he didn’t listen to “the Talk” black parents supposedly give their kids.

On the other hand, both Martin and Neighborhood Watch shooter George Zimmerman were, in separate ways, victims of our decaying social order. One of the most revealing comments in the 9-1-1 tape was when Martin said, “These a—holes always get away.”

Note that Zimmerman did not say, “These n-----s always get away.” He was frustrated with rampant crime in his neighborhood. When people feel unsafe in their own homes, they arm themselves and take matters into their own hands."

"I thought we were discussing transgender people and they are not the same as gay.  Transgender people, despite having a biological penis or vagina, ""feel"" they were born in the wrong body.  Even for Rachel Dolezol who pretends to be black, her race/ethnicity is not biological.  You can't ""feel"" you are one race when you are biologically something else.   ""Gender assignment""--what an odd expression--is based on science.  A penis equals male; a vagina equals female.  How society deals with these issues depends on the prevailing social mores and the requirements or restrictions of its institutions.  We now live in a culture of moral relativism instead of moral realism, and that affects the whole society from politics to education to social issues.  I accept a person's right to do whatever to his/her body, but it is my right to not approve.   My acceptance never seems to be enough.  And then there are transgenders who change, then change back, then change again.   Google that."
"Rename the University halls, yes. Get overly wrought over a law professor's dumb and insensitive (but well-meaning) black face stunt in her own home? Gimme a break.

"If you read this thread of comments you will see that the ""blame game"" is in full-force.  It accomplishes absolutely nothing POSITIVE and only intensifies the divisions already present regarding the issue of violence in America and, specifically, the violence between the police and the Black community.  

During the riots which followed the acquittal of the officers involved in his beating in 1992, Rodney King famously asked ""can't we all just get along?""  The answer, sadly, was ""NO, We Can't"".... It's 24 years later and, again sadly, the answer continues to be NO.  What the hell's wrong with us as a society?  Can't we, somehow, do better than this?

"As I am already 68, I personally know what happened in the 60's because I lived it.  The democrats, both North and South, have always been the racist bigots that they remain today.  As LBJ was merging with the evil progressives, they needed a new way to control the Black citizens, so he came up with the ""Great Society"" and a bunch of other socialist ideas to entrap the poor people in our Republic, promising all kinds of wonderful things, but still needing the Republicans to pass his Civil Rights Bill, because the democrats, both North and South refused to go along with any idea of integration of the races.  The wonderful Robert Bird of West Virginia even filibustered against it!  I seem to remember how Hillary praised him as her mentor, but I could be mistaken(?)  Then there is Senator Fulbright, a very strong and vocal KKK member, who was the mentor of a certain William Jefferson Clinton.  But we all know that Bill was considered the ""first Black President"".  So when the democrats."

Amazing how so many of these comments prove her point. A black woman sharing a personal experience of not fitting in has somehow become a threat or whinny. 99% of you all have never had the experience of being the only one in the room. But you have opinions though. Lots of them. You guys... are something else.
For a very long time it was a power differential between the two races that kept blacks out of professional sports. Would you have complained about that? What these anthem resisters are doing is trying to remind us that the differential is still around in this world.
"""We don't know ""why"" the Walmart Shooter stopped shooting and left after shooting/killing ""only"" 3 people. For an ""insane mass shooter"" to go to a store and shoot ""only 3"" random people he apparently did not know and then leave is....very uncharacteristic....of the typical mass shooter.""
.
Except for the facts that they apparently weren't random and he didn't fit the usual definition of a ""mass shooter"". They were seemingly targeted for their ethnicity. And such shootings of people by category followed by an immediate retreat is not uncommon among such incidents. Like the couple who walked into a restaurant, shot two cops, and left. Or the ""skinhead"" who shot a black couple. Or any of a large number of other multiple (but not ""mass"") ""stranger"" shootings."
"It is nice to see the UO Black Student group take the high road on this matter but the rest of the student body should be stepping in and supporting the black students at this point (The entire Eugene/Springfield community for that matter).  This is an issue that should affect everyone and the University should not be allowed to get their way because a minority group is willing to accept this decision.  Stand up for yourself, your fellow students, your community, your University."
"One of our (meaning Catholics across the board) overarching problems with Liturgical music is that it is in competition with the celebrants at the altar and in the sanctuary.  Catholic Eucharistic liturgies have not gotten even close to the true concept of community celebration.  That's what the black Protestant churches - and the black Catholic churches by extension - have had down pat for a very long time.  The form of music is secondary to the fit between it and the confection of the Eucharist.  It has been - historically - a competition between the two.  A wonderful liturgist I know told me not so long ago that it will always be so due to the nature of our particular form of worship that is rigidly set in one and only one way.  Describes the whole Church, doesn't it?  He went on to tell me of how many Church choir directors have intense competitions for who can produce the most thrilling music.  One need only attend Mass at various NYC major churches to know how true that is."
"In his condemnation of President Trump and his supporters, the author echos the refrain that left-wing progressives have been repeating for months.  He claims that he is speaking for all black Americans (""The truth is that the black community is looking on warily and with a rising sense of alarm at the chaos"").  That is manifestly not true. Many black Americans voted for Trump because of his strong commitment to fighting crime in large cities, such as Chicago and Detroit, where gangs are terrorizing black communities and where the local Democrat parties, in power for decades, have done little for the safety of the population. Mr. Thorne also deliberately avoids mentioning any of the prominent black Americans who at great risk to themselves and their families have publicly supported Trump.  For example, read what football legend Jim Brown had to say.

"Would you like to go over the flag code and speak about the various ways it is disrespected by the NFL itself (displaying the flag horizontally), many fans (wearing apparel with the flag on it), and our President (selling apparel with the flag on it and using it as advertisements), or are you only concerned about (mostly) black athletes not meeting a 'status quo' of what you believe patriotism should require?

Shall we also go over the First Amendment and point out that forced patriotism is among the last things the Founders of this country would find to be within American values?"
"Malcolm Jenkins exhibits the ""Black Power"" salute as a reflection of his intolerance of anyone not African-American. Mr. Jenkins can go to the public square and extol his racist views. However, Mr. Jenkins' racist demonstration is in the workplace. His actions, and the actions of his fellow ""Black Power protestors"", clearly created a racially hostile work environment. https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm. 

Moreover, if Mr. Jenkins was in active duty military, he and any other ""Black Power"" crew, would be charged under the UCMJ, Article 117 Provoking Speech and Gestures. Clearly, the NFL isn't the military. 

Why the NFL players and NFLPA believe that creating racially hostile work environment for players and the customers eludes rational minds. In the workplace, my ""rights"" don't trump yours or anyone else. Perhaps, we should join the NFL?"
"Thank you for this incredibly relevant post.  It is this vital point you raise (the passing of the NDAA of 2012) that consistently gets lost in this topic by Clarence Moriwaki, Tom Ikeda of Densho, and others.

Obama, with bipartisan and nearly unanimous support (including from then Congressman Jay Inslee), passed this law that allows the president on his say so alone... to have the military secretly arrest an American citizen or legal resident in America, without charge or trial, and secretly hold them in a black site prison anywhere in the world.... indefinitely.  No due process.

Yet Clarence, while quick to mention Trump and his fears, consistently praised Obama and Inslee (who he worked for as special assistant) with no detectable (that we can find) rebuke for what they did with the NDAA of 2012.  Obama even defended this unconstitutional power in court against the liberal plaintiffs Chris Hedges, Dr. Cornel West, Noam Chomsky, and Dan Ellsburg.

Why the silence?  Never again?"
"Your argument is based entirely on your own anecdotal evidence which means it is very weak as far as any kind of objective proof goes. 

I can give plenty of personal anecdotal evidence of non-WASPs being racist towards people of colour. In fact I can give anecdotal evidence of black people being racist against other black people based on what island they come from in the Caribbean. 

That doesn't mean I can make sweeping generalizations as if they are objective fact."

Does the average Alaskan know who developed our highway in addition to them?  Don't you think they'd like to know?  What ""extra hardships"" were placed on black soldiers?  I don't know what working in that environment in the 1940's would be like, but I am certainly willing to bet it was full of ""hardship"" no matter WHO you were.

"No, you are right, they were a group of greedy Europeans, but then the rest of the world were greedy too.  Africans sold their own people into slavery.  The Arabs facilitated the African slave catchers. Everyone was greedy, callous and indifferent.  But, for all other nations, except Canada, they have got over it.  We, on the other hand seem to enjoy the hair shirt and flagellating ourselves, trying to rid ourselves of what the Eastern intelligentsia have deemed out colonial past.  Why not say; 'Yes, we know it was wrong"" and get on with life.  There is a lot to celebrate about Canada, so forgive our fore-bearers their sins and get on with life."
"If the filibuster dies history will record that it was the Republicans who killed it, just as history will record that Republicans abandoned two hundred years of history to prevent hearings on President Obama's lawful nomination of Merrick Garland to the bench.

But I must say, I find this sentence objectionable: ""A Supreme Court nomination battle only highlights the degree to which they [Democrats] are beholden to abortion rights and gay rights groups.""

If Democrats are ""beholden"" to gay rights groups they are equally ""beholden"" to groups that support women's rights, children's rights, black people's right, workers' rights, poor people's rights, and individual rights against wealthy corporate interests - in short, Democrats care about the little guy and those who are downtrodden, i.e. the very people Republicans have forgotten. Singling out gay rights groups merely exposes MSW's own personal bias, and I must say, it's rather revealing."

You totally discount that they also have minds and saw that the choices given were rather dire. They didn't pick your candidate.

I have relatives who voted before Hillary. To this day we still speak to each other. I look at them and think they were misguided, but not bad people. Unfortunately, the way I have been treated and characterized by Hillary supporters is that we are evil people AND I DID NOT EVEN VOTE FOR TRUMP.

Remember we have a sad, bad history of race relations and passions are still high and of late the ruling powers are using the race hate card to keep themselves in power by any means possible. I believe Ferguson but that does not give me the right (an outsider with zero influence or at all attached to either party) to sit in comfort of my computer and pretend I am the most moral person around, boosting my ego.

"Abortion is a personal choice. While not a fan,outlawing it will not stop abortion just make  unsafe and certainly will not make the mother love the child. But when we talk about having a President we must look at the whole role of a President. He represents us- the American people. But instead of looking at that, we have elected a man who seems to have no problems with people suffering even more. What happens to the 20 million plus who have no health insurance. What happens to the disable and elderly when Medicare and SS is dismantled. What about those of color or people of other faiths. Trump has done little to separate himself from his racist views especially with who he is choosing who will be his closest advisor.  All these things that Trump stands for are views Catholics and Christian should not support. Those who voted for Trump because of abortion has excepted his other evils as OK. Since abortion is a personal choice some women will chose it legal or not or who is in office."

But the Electoral College—a prototype of which Madison proposed in this same speech—instead let each southern state count its slaves, albeit with a two-fifths discount, in computing its share of the overall count.""

"""Today the continuing poisoning of half a million American children is tolerated partly because the victims often are low-income children of color.""

I think it is outrageous for the writer to make this claim.  Lead poisoning is tolerated because by and large it is invisible and is not routinely detected.  Until a few years ago, copper pipe used to disperse water throughout our buildings was joined with lead containing solder.  Probably most houses in the country have lead in their pipes.  When water is not used often lead from the solder can dissolve and reach appreciable concentrations.  

The big thing about lead is that it takes really high doses to produce obvious symptoms.  To some extent low dose exposures are not obviously connected to harm.  The whole subject is controversial.  Run your water a bit before drinking it to flush the high lead content out."

That concept ""expired"" and is a dead concept as federal law prohibits it.  The same kind of law that states use to protect more than racial discrimination that prevent business owners to ""act any way they want at their own business.""

Do you get the point now?  Legal precedent is quite set and has killed any belief that business owners are free to discriminate based upon race, ethnicity, nationality, and under Anchorage ordinance sexual orientation."
"Happens all day long in Chicago. Plenty of grieving mothers having children taken from them by perfectly reasonable, 'non-assault' weapons.

Last I checked, they aren't running rampant through the streets with 'black guns' shooting up the 'hood.

Nothing knee-jerk about using truth to describe or inform others as to what something truly is, and how it's used, rather than fear-mongering with lies to rile up the public into a sheep-stampede.

Sure he is starting something in his mind and likes the attention but is it because he was demoted to 2nd string or what? There are other ways to protest but to not show respect to the National Anthem and the country that has really been good to him and a family that raised him and all of the benefits that he and his friends have worked for and received is rather childish.

"And it’s why every beaten-down, nameless, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what was called the middle class loves Trump.

"Agreed, good teams don't wilt when games get bigger. Also, I'm so tired of the same old refrain from Black,it's always we didn't get that big hit, or we couldn't get that timely hit, just didn't hit in key situations, etc. etc. That is the very definition of a clutch hit, or of a clutch team. Hitting with RISP has been an issue all year, and has been horrific in September. This team simply has rolled over and played dead when it has mattered most."
"That is just as incorrect as saying the US Senate was intended to dehumanize black slaves.

Both the Electoral  College and the US Senate were intended to protect small states (initially mostly in the relatively slave-free North) from domination by the more populated or largely unsettled states (of initially the mid-Atlantic and South).

The 3/5 rule was a result of the enslaved status of blacks.... not a cause if that enslavement.

Ironically, in the Constitutional Convention, it was the slave masters of the southern states that wanted slaves counted as full persons vrs the northern state representatives who wanted slaves counted not at all because they were not free men eligible to actually vote.

Slavery was a terrible practice. But it had nothing to do with the creation of an Electoral College."

"At least five years ago, when climate change was still denied by many, long-range modelers predicted as a specific detail of the world-wide phenomenon, a desiccation of the south-western regions of the African continent. That too, was the period when it became increasingly obvious that the Lesotho Highlands scheme phase II was seriously mis-managed politically and corruptly that its first water deliveries would be delayed for at least ten years. Phase I was already  nearing completion in 1994.

Had not the RDP been disrupted by Thabo Mbeki and the resulting looting of the state seamlessly taken over by Zuma, quite probably by now the country, or at least its main metropolitan  regions, would have been linked by a national water pipeline grid.

"Just like in civil jurisprudence, the new overcomes the old. We don't have apostates stand in fromt of the Chruch anymore in sack cloth and ashes. Indeed, except in Syria where Islamic State attacks Christians, we no longer have apostates. There is no one else on earth who is being told to abandon Christ or be martyred. Maybe Pashtunistan, but I suspect most of the victims of Muslim Trads are simply killed rather than being given the opportunity to express faith in Allah, since Allah is Arabic for Elohim, which is Hebrew for God. Technically, saying there is no God but Allah is not apostacy because it is the same word. DH, by the way, gets us out of that mindset which has wars over religion or doctrine. That  is not piety, it is sacralidge. DH is the final step in denouncing the past sacrliedges of the Inquisition, the 100 years war, the Crusades and the blood shed in the 4th Century over heresy."

"Today history books wouldn't mention the plight of inter-city blacks. The question still remains, who has kept blacks in inter-cities, with promise after promise to make thing right. 

Segregation is part on human existence. Many segregate themselves by religion, by where they live, by who the vote for,  by their sports teams. Not every one here supports the Broncos. There are many different forms of segregation, and yes some involve race. However great strides were made to over come that with the election of Obama. However it didn't work out so well."
"I stand up and furiously applaud banishing a garb which has been used to ensure women are viewed as non entities on the street.  This is nothing but cultural misogyny  oppressing a woman's human rights  under the guise of  theocratic approval.

Some countries so far have banned: Belgium, Bulagria, Italy, Cameroon, Niger

Their holy book offers no specific guidance on female clothing. Its pages contain no mention of the burka or, for that matter, of the other varieties of dress that are now associated with Islam, including the hijab, or veil.

When the Taliban captured Kabul and seized power over most of Afghanistan in 1996, they made it compulsory for all women to wear the burka.It was the rise of the Wahhabi and Deobandi traditions which spread the burka to areas where it was previously invisible, including West Africa.  Nothing to do with religion but cultural misogyny!"

"They advise park visitors to wear little bells on their clothes so they make noise when hiking. The bell noise allows bears to hear them coming from a distance and not be startled by a hiker accidentally sneaking up on them. This might cause a bear to charge.
Visitors should also carry a pepper spray can just in case a bear is encountered. Spraying the pepper into the air will irritate the bear's sensitive nose and it will run away.
It is also a good idea to keep an eye out for fresh bear scat so you have an idea if bears are in the area. People should be able to recognize the difference between black bear and grizzly bear scat.
Black bear droppings are smaller and often contain berries, leaves, and possibly bits of fur. Grizzly bear droppings tend to contain small bells and smell of pepper."

"Just for info's sake. Yes, switchblades are now legal in Alaska and we pre-empt local laws against them just like guns, for the same reasons. The laws against automatic knives/gravity knives (and still criminalized brass knuckles, in fact) were based on fear of  latinos and blacks created by Hollywood, not any factual reason. They aren't faster to open than many folding knives, and are slower than a fixed blade, but less suited for use in harming people (weak hinge). 

Always look at the propriety of laws in terms of facts and history, not publicity."

"When you use the N word, you’re ignoring the pain and the racist history of this country”

""there are soldiers who are waging war with stories, rhetoric, peaceful protest and radial patience.""

"It is so rare to have a civil conversation with lefties but I am used to empty arguments being augmented with vindictive insults.  I am glad that you admit your Party's historical mistakes. The Civil Rights Act happened in '64 and according to you, from '65 to the present all the bigots voted Republican.  If that were true why did it take another 20 years until Republicans finally won the majority in the Congress?  Why did we have to experience the incompetence of Carter and lies of Clinton for both of their terms?  It is easy to call an entire portion of the country racist instead of admitting that the Democratic Party has been taken over by a bunch of radical leftist. Democrats spat on soldiers, became ""green"" and didn't care about the costs to jobs. They made Abortion a litmus test for membership. They mock religious people, take away their gun rights, property rights and deride the military and police, Southerners know a Commie when they see one. They hate Reds, not Blacks."
"Mr. Thorne has written a column that is entirely predictable. Writing from his secure position in academia and strictly following the left-wing narrative, the author adds nothing new to the public discourse.  It certainly is an entirely risk-free position for him to take.  He will see no students protesting his views nor any academics criticizing him, either because they agree with him, or in the cases where they don't, because they will be to afraid of the consequences of saying so.  But he is a law professor in Toronto.  Why isn't he writing about a current contentious Canadian issue, say the decision of the organizing committee of the Gay Pride parade in Toronto to ban gay police officers from marching in the parade? Does the professor agree that the organizing committee should have given in to the demand of the #Blacklivesmatter pressure group in ordering this ban?"

(And it's only ""legal"" because in another great SCOTUS decision based on fantasy...somewhere in their drug addled brains a majority of the justices ""found"" a ""penumbra"" in the Constitution that allowed it.)  The Constitution, which enumerates the powers given to the federal government was silent on a woman's right to commit infanticide of her child.  I refer you to Amendment 10.  To pass laws allowing or disallowing the murder of one's children before they're born is a state matter.  At least, to this point, it's still illegal to murder them AFTER they're born!"

"King's adultery has been well known and talked about for decades. He was trained at a very liberal seminary (I believe it was Union Theological Seminary) and did not believe the Bible was the Word of God or that the blood of Jesus could save anyone. His associations with communists were also known. Same with Jesse Jackson, who was a well known friend of Communist Fidel Castro and one of King's aides. Just look at the Congressional black caucus in Congress: chock full of communists.
Did King do some good? Yes. His protests were peaceful, and he sought to change the social status of black people in America through peaceful protests, which is admirable. But let's not paint King as some kind of saint. He was not. He has no credibility as a man of God."

"I suggest you read the US Justice Department DAG memo 8/29/13 that outlines their stance on state's rights on marijuana enforcement. The Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (signed by Richard Nixon) categorizes marijuana a schedule 1 drug, defined as a ""drug"" that has a high potential for abuse and no medicinal value. First off, marijuana is a plant, if I buy or grow a plant, it's none of the government's business whether I eat or smoke it. Second, it's very widely accepted that marijuana has a very wide array of medicinal and therapeutic value, so this is an absurd scofflaw. If you look at the list of drugs on schedule 1, these are all plants and substances that were widely used and accepted by the anti-Nixon movement and the Black Community. The CSA was used as a tool to scare the public and incarcerate Nixon's opponents. It's time for change."

There is really no evidence to suggest that black troops did anything but menial, manual labor for Confederate troops, just as they did for their masters. Rather, the entire South feared the possibility of slave revolts for 50 years before the Civil War, after the Haitian Revolution, so the notion that significant numbers of them would have served under the South under arms is more than a little counterintuitive.

There was something like 222,000 black men in Union forces. About 40,000 of them DIED, all this according to the National Archives. 18 of them won the Congressional Medal of Honor.

In the same vein , they support Black Lives members protests as free speech----even when they call for killing police , yet if the Klan marches , they want them beat up and stopped.  And speaking of flags---when someone moves to the U.S. , they are supposed to be an American now.  Yet instead of becoming one of us and supporting the U.S. flag---they proudly hang the flag of the country they came from , from their car mirrors.

There is the evidence of our own eyes based on what is going on in Europe where mass waves of African and Middle East migrants have entered, failed to assimilate, self segregate, and engage in criminal and violent behaviour at rates vastly beyond those of the general population.  There is also a religious / cultural element here that as much as people want to ignore, remains a factor.  Then, there is the issue of numbers.  There were never this many jews, Vietnamese, or Hungarians trying to enter the West all at once, there was time to assimilate, and there was much less contact with the home country once they came here, so they assimilated better and more quickly.  There was less government support for them, so they had to enter the workforce quickly. Now the more children they make, the more support they get.

"Don't quite understand why this discussion becomes a comparison between Obama, Bush, Clinton etc. The issue is the President in office today. He is the only one responsible right now to bring the Country together and he is doing the opposite. In my experience it is the first time in decades that a President has used the rhetoric of devicevness so effectively to keep the attention away from his limited understanding of the issues and the lack of his accomplishments. He emboldens the racist element that has always existed in the US (hence the hatred for Obama shortly after taking office) and unfortunately lowered the bar in public discourse and this has seeped into Canada as well. It is now fashionable to blame others for one's problems except of course if you're a visible minority and don't want to get shot by the police while doing nothing illegal.

In fact, it would not have raised an eyebrow if any other Republican who won the presidency in 2016 pardoned Arpaio, the perfect symbol of the prejudice and scorn Republicans have embraced ever since Barry Goldwater gave the finger to black and brown Americans by opposing the 1964 Civil Rights Act."

"It's a shame...Trump could have done so much, but was strapped with a 20 Trillion dollar Obama debt around his neck.   Trump was in a sense ""lynched"" by this debt inherited from spend thrift Obama, who never paid the piper. He simply printed more money.  ""I still have checks in the checkbook mentality:""

It's a shame.  Trump had all this populist energy...twice the numbers of blacks and Hispanics that Romney had just 4 years ago...and there was just no way any human could surmount the sad state of finances given to him by Barack Obama."

"No...my father's great grandfather came from Germany, just in time to serve in the Civil War, and be seriously wounded at the Battle of Malvern Hill, fighting in the New York Artillery. (And being awarded a Medal of Honor).  My mother's family came from Ireland, primarily, to Massachusetts, and lived in an area called ""Hungry Hill"" where the Irish were ""allowed"" to live.  You obviously don't know squat about how immigrants were treated, and somehow think your forebears are the only ones that suffered discrimination.  Wish I had the ""privileges"" of GW Carver, Ben Carson, and other blacks who succeeded in SPITE of obstacles.  I'm betting my last dollar, THEY didn't sit around, sniveling about their lot in life.  They went out and MADE something of themselves, just like my family did.  WE might not have dressed like the Kennedys, but we were always warm in the winter, had food on the table, and learned a moral compass and work ethic."
"I don't think authorities will pursue bias charges, as these two suspects are not very light complected.  An Ancestry DNA test may show they're multi-racial, including African.  If I were the suspects' attorney, I'd have them get a DNA analysis, especially if they were being prosecuted for a hate crime.  The question would be ... can an African-American be prosecuted for calling another African-American a racial slur."
"Europe took us for a ride for half a century. We lowered our tariffs and they kept theirs high. We opened our labor markets to their people and they kept theirs shut against ours. We paid for their defense while they handed out goodies to their people. Now they want us to cough up big so the UN can bribe Africans to stay home and not crash their borders, naturally while denouncing us for trying to keep order on our own borders. They hate Trump because he's shutting down their gravy train. No more global Santa Claus. 

(Oh, and also because he won't help them pay Hamas and Iran to finish the Final Solution.)

"I might agree that some people have overdone bringing in relatives.  However, it is not by having anchor babies...which this law is not actually addressing.   The largest number of anchor babies are Chinese.  Thriving business in parts of Ca. and it is the more affluent among the Chinese who do this.

Nonetheless, the goal is to reduce immigrants in general (something that might be based on xenophobia), and to greatly reduce the numbers of immigrants of color.   I imagine there is some reality to the idea that the countries of color are more wedded to extended family concepts than North Europeans have traditionally been.  And clearly there are more people who will have to learn English while they are toiling in American fields and hotel kitchens coming from countries that both have greater poverty and greater negative stereotypes attached to them."

"If a government official, acting in that capacity, preaches about the Christ, he is clearly breaking the law. If you don't know that, then you should go back to your law school and demand a retroactive failing grade in constitutional law. I'm sure that Everson v. Board of Education, 330 U.S. 1 (1947) was touched on in that class -- when I took a constitutional law class, the professor discussed Justice Black's majority opinion at length."
"Our first obligation is to seek the kingdom of God and His righteousness. 

What would you tell someone in the antebellum South who said their conscience told them blacks weren't people and that it was their right to own slaves?  Would you still say our first obligation is to respect the conscience of others? Why or why not?

The unborn have immortal souls, but so does everyone else.  It doesn't make killing the already born morally justifiable.

So much of this mistaken autonomy of conscience that the CCC speaks of can be boiled down to, ""I decide for myself what is good and evil."""

"Being ""terrific"" has nothing to do with anything here.  It's the natural logic of the colonizee and of course, the natural put-off by the colonizor.  Your inapposite comparison, professor, is that blacks were not indigenous to the continent and so, were not ""colonized"" as in my comparative context.  But you are on the correct professorially expected articulation re female sexual mutilation in Muslim countries.  While repugnant to the likes of you and me as well -- acts of which we'd surely punish severely in our own hometowns with LAWS enacted by the norms of our respective societies -- it would be professorially inane for you, as example, to presume codification of a foreign country's culture and/or acts under the US Code Annotated and then publish a book accordingly concluding your value judgments."
"I think we all agree more details need to emerge before anything beyond sheer speculation can be made.

I do know, however, that as a general rule, we should be extremely cautious with any object that can inflict injury when interacting with police officers.  Tragedies have occurred when police have called out to a person, and in a split-second decision, shot that person when faced with a weapon.  Why?  Because there is an instinctive (or natural) tendency to respond to a command or verbal challenge by turning to face it.  If a person happens to be holding a gun, or in this case a crossbow, then the natural reaction is to turn to the source of the challenge while still holding whatever it is that's being held.

It happens in police-on-police shootings too.  After a notorious incident some years ago, it was advised that if you happen to be a black officer in plain clothes, that it would be unwise to engage in a foot pursuit holding your gun if uniformed officers may suddenly intervene."
"Join the boycott. Many LGBT will be staying away, hopefully enough to empty the parade route.  There is an effort to organize spectators to turn their backs on BLM and  polticans who supported BLM / Pride extortion.   Or, shout out a resounding BOOOOOO when they do pass by.  Ironically  the police are our only real allies anymore.  Many people will be wearing their blue shirts and uniforms to show solidarity with the police."

"So are your lectors going to form a special class that will demand that the Church allow them to stay in the sanctuary?  Or will they leave or refuse to read because they have been denied a special right?

The whole progressive movement is grounded in labeling people and demanding special privileges for those that are different in a well-intentioned effort to unify.  But when people are labeled and singled out for special attention, that is de facto divisive (that's why ""diversity"" efforts are misguided).  

Blacks should have no beef with the Church; the Church has no duty to make a special effort in their political causes.  People with same-sex attraction, at least, have a legitimate beef in that the Church expressly disapproves of their chosen use of their sex organs.  But when your core teaching revolves around male-female, procreation, parents raising their children, and the like, it's for the person to change not the Church."
"His belief and portrayal of the current US administration is a good example of how the ""progressives"" actually see their own agenda and platform. Obama was black; that alone for them is literally a step towards a world utopia.

"A year after Mary Spilde succeeded Dr. Moskus, her approval among all staff groups was gone. Her precipitating actions included: 1.

LCC staff kept approaching me about the process. E.g. a South Lane School District Board member & LCC staffer asked me if I knew why it was taking a month for Carr's references to be completed, 2.  Hiring, not the # 1 candidate--an African American man--not the # 2 candidate--an Asian American woman--but the # 3 candidate--an African American  woman as the Vice President for Instruction & Student Services. Parenthetically, she lasted less than 3 years on the job etc.  Dr. Hamilton must be provided explicit performance guidance & consequences based management.  Shame on LCC's Board and us a community if, as expected given it's current governance profile, it does 1 iota less."
"It is not that they are complaining as much as HOW they are complaining and about what.

There is no rise in shootings of blacks by police.

Or actually use some of their huge salaries to better publicize their discontents."
"Various clerics and clerical groups owned chattel slaves as late as the 19th century, and no one in the institutional Church  said they were wrong to do so. Obviously, the institutional Church found chattel slavery to be morally acceptable.

Your statement that the institutional Church has always opposed exploitation of people is demonstrably false."

"(Part two of three)  Human consciousness is creation-consciousness, inseparable from Creation/ Creator Consciousness.—sylvester(pat)steffen seems like a convoluted way of writing, “the word of life—for the life was made visible; we have seen it and testify to it” (1 John 1:1-2).

Am I handing Hitler posthumous victories?—John Hobson  Rather than looking back, like the historian I am, look forward, where historians have little to no business.  Try taking on a Black identity to see whether a Black identity is American identity at its finest.  Land of the free, home of the brave . . . no better found than in the African-American experience.  While the Black experience highlights the American Dilemma, the Black experience also highlights the American Dream, for without the Dilemma, there would be no Dream and without a Dream there would be no Dilemma."
"Nothing to be sorry about. 
Second first:  ""Catholicism has been marginal to the African-American experience"", is to me actually, counter-intuitive. To stay on the margin on a significant value item that is relevant to Christ is itself a statement of betrayal to His mission. 
First: We ""designate"" a saint as patron for a value in the pretense that that value is actively - rather than rhetorically - supported."
"“There is a profound misunderstanding of what race really is,” Harvard anthropology professor Daniel Lieberman said at an event the night after the presidential debate. “Race is a scientifically indefensible concept with no biological basis as applied to humans.”

That alone is a killer to an Al Sharpton or Jesse Jackson let alone Black Lives Matters movement. 

Also most people are unaware that the term ""African American"" and  ""African American community"" is widely incorrectly used by many. The term “African-American” only appropriately applies to descendants of Africans brought to America as slaves. There are many, many people of dark skin color in American, some having African heritage but not all are descendants of those who were slaves.

It's way past time to start being a part of humanity and forget about using those childish crayons."
"Charles, what have the lib boys ever done for black folks?  I think you should seriously rethink the liberal path.  Liberals are not for equality.  They are very happy to keep minorities poor and dependent.  Think hard on it.  There are things we Americans could do to stimulate growth and self-development of all Americans.  The libbers do not support those actions."
"'The NAACP now opposes Sen. Jeff Sessions.....though in 2009 they honored him with their Governmental Award of Excellence.' ""The 2009 award was ""discovered"" by an aide to Sessions while ""cleaning out the office"". Given that Sessions has for decades been an impediment to civil rights for black people, this plaque is most likely a crude joke. At any rate, the NAACP is now adamantly opposed to having one of the South's most notorious bigots running the Justice Department, speaking of a crude, and cruel, joke on 37 million of our citizens."
"It may be better to say the church no longer ""owns"" my body. In some cases physically and in other cases emotionally or spiritually. Just think of the aborted babies in the cesspools near nunneries in Ireland. The orphans were beaten and worked to the bone in the Church schools in Ireland. Nuns were NOT women of virtue--neither were many of the clergy or priests. Yet homoerotic enjoyment was sub rosa, while abortions continued in ecclesiastical settings. This behavior wasn't limited to Ireland. Rome was a bastion of wonderful behavior in its ecclesiastical settings. Sure, sins of all humans, but this was in the ""church"" and not in secular settings."
100% with the police on this one. If police are excluded from Pride then it should receive zero funding. Maybe the Black Lives Matter crew will fund it.
"You don't profile based on a crime.  You profile based on the suspicion of a crime.  Let's say that someone reports a burglary in their neighborhood.  The police are dispatched and on the way there they see a black guy in a hoodie.  He avoids making eye-contact with the police and they decide that that is suspicious and they want to talk to him.  After all, black people disproportionately commit crime, right? Once the black guy realizes that the cops want to ""talk"" to him, he runs.  After all, how often does an encounter with a police officer end well for a black man?  The police chase him down, tackle him, and handcuff him. Good for blue, they didn't shoot him.  As they search his clothing, they find a small baggy of marijuana and arrest him for possession -- and they tack on resisting arrest for good measure."
Black is not a Canadian.
"You are oversimplifying what is, yes, a complex issue.

What is happening in Asia and elsewhere is non-western cultures ""appropriating"" what they admire in western culture, adapting it to their tastes and needs, and leaving the rest.

And lots of immigrants to the west still listen to music from ""home"", still watch tv and movies from ""home"" , etc. . They prefer them to ""western"" music, tv, movies, etc., and thanks to cable and satellite and the Internet, it is a lot easier for them to stay immersed in that world than it was a few decades ago.

Did you know when early anthropologists and musicologists tested the reaction of Africans to jazz, they were shocked to find out Africans were puzzled by it, despite its African roots.

The tastes of people are largely based on what they are familiar with, and they will be attracted to things that are somewhat new, but not totally. Tastes in adults evolve gradually, they don't change drastically overnight."
"Ms. King later thanked Sessions for his support in the construction of the Rosa Parks Library and Museum.  MLK's niece (Dr. Alveda King) rebuked Warren for using Ms. King for political theatre but we can't talk about that, it affects the Globe's entire political narrative for this piece."
"I hope the governor sticks to his word! It's time to take these people off the bottle and give all equal treatment. Have to treat everybody equal! If the country /state cuts all the Free unearned benefits, people will figure out how to get by. This state need EEO and more opportunity for all. I got turned down at South Central foundation for a job because the the human resources lady told me, ""you don't qualify because your not native"". Exact words, No lie. The alaskan economy is tumbling down from enabling these people with free health care, free money and a job regardless if the person is qualified or not! I'm a life long alaskan and had to join the army for college. It's irritating to see natives cry wolf everyone it's time to develop. These people are rarely educated and the state can't keep up with the world's economy. If anybody deserves free $ I would have to say African Americans because they did more labor for this country than anybody. Not big racist, just speaking facts!"
"Meanwhile what became of the people captured by JTF-2? We know the army gave their prisoners to the Afghans where they were abused and anyone in country knew they would be abused. That was wrong for a bunch of legal and practical reasons but we've ignored the question of SOF prisoners.

Presumably the people they detained were of higher value than run of the mill Afghans and JTF-2 was part of an American commanded SOF Task Force.  These prisoners must have been considered of some intelligence value so where did they go? Libya? Poland? Which black site were they taken to in order to be tortured into giving up information? 

Or did JTF-2 arrange it's operations so someone else ""captured"" the prisoners? I'll also accept that they didn't capture anyone- a sign of inaction or a ""take no prisoners"" policy although I find the latter unlikely."
"Agonising my foot! There was never any doubt.

"You get 5 chances (the black popup) to vote the way they want you to vote and then you are banned. Banning means you only get 3 posts a day. The banning seems like it is done by a human because it actually takes several minutes to take effect.
It's a bad idea and the introduction has been insanely badly handled. Way to go Globe and Mail.
I guess you could just always vote every article as uncivil. That would work work for a while, then they will put in metrics to see if you are voting too uniformly.
If they are going to say that after a certain number of ""UNcivil"" votes for an article that everyone after that must vote the same way why are they even continuing to ask people's opinion? Seems very poorly thought out....  maybe they don't see the problem with ""It's a democracy and you get to have a vote - but you have to vote the way we want you to vote. But hey not only do you get a vote but you must vote!!"""
"Agree with every word!

There are certainly reasonable grounds to criticise Quebec's new law, but to ignore or deny the regressive, misogynist, and anti-western message conveyed by Muslim veils is willful self-deception.

"Suggest that my perceptions are that Maimane is just there to appeal to the black vote. Why would I think this? 

Firstly, he has never held any leadership position, he was only the spokesperson of the DA and he has failed on numerous occasions to get elected in any leadership capacity. Next thing he gets shoe-ed in as leader. 

Secondly, this is not his first major gaffe and he seems completely oblivious of not only his own party's policies, but of our national policies (think Zambia). 

Thirdly, as soon as he announced his decision to suspend Zille, a bunch of has-beens in the party jumped on the opportunity to express support for Maimane, and to echo calls for her to resign. 

Would it not appear that there is merit to the idea that these has-beens are the guys pulling Maimane's strings?

To who exactly does Maimane appeal? Versus Zille's appeal across the board, and her proven track record in the Western Cape?"
"Citizens United and the destruction of the Voting Right Act. Scalia and the other conservatives on the Supreme court have done more to destroy our Democracy than perhaps even Trump will. Thanks to those two decisions Dark money now runs this country. Who even knows who is behind all that money that buys so many politicians in DC? And thanks to the destruction of the Voting Rights Act, the GOP has been set free to make voting almost impossible for the poor, people of color (those who vote Democrat). Let's not forget redistricting also! Wake up America! Our Democracy is under attack. If we can't vote and we can't follow the money than we are no longer living in a Democracy!"
This is a frenzy of Victimhood  featuring the craven response of the University establishment. An eminent Jewish scholar is demonized just like black field hands getting the lash because the  Master's daughter whined about mere slaves  joking with her.
"It would be really helpful for her to explain more fully the conversation.  Is she saying that she was trying to describe the stories in the newspapers where this parent talked about racism and her/her child being called the n-word and that's when she used the word, or is she saying she couldn't remember the woman's name and she chose that pronoun to refer to her?  The former might be forgivable but the latter... uh, no. 

Given the problems in Georgina, she's probably used to using/hearing the word.  Let's face it, there are places not too far north of Toronto where black people are still referred to as 'darkies'.

On another note, she is 82 years old, its time for new blood on that board...maybe she can use her experience/ serve her community in a volunteer capacity if she cannot be a source of wisdom and leadership for said board."
"Russian operatives set up an array of misleading Web sites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior.
The sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook “retargeting” tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.
We could just as easily be describing an effort by the NRA or the RNC.
Except that it was a foreign government intent on undermining American interests.

"The core FLAW in this author's argument is the simple fact that very stringent screening procedures HAVE resulted in a low number of radical terrorists entering the US . So in a convoluted way she argues that more stringent screening if not a ban are unnecessary. Huh?
We also know that all the countries on the list have been targets of US covert or overt action - directly through bombing (Libya, Syria), drone strikes (Sudan and Yemen) or sanctions (Iran). Because they have been US targets, that alone makes them enemies of the USA and therefore in need of careful screening.
She also ignores the point that this is a temporary ban until improved screening measures are in place. Until then why take the risk?
Trump isn't so much making the US safer he is just cleaning up the mess left behind by his predecessor - that indirectly will improve American security.
Fact is Canada also screens applicants from these countries to the point that very few if any get in - we just don't publicise it."
"Oh sweet irony.  The gist of the BLM message is they expect to resolve their concerns (of being unfairly stereotyped by the police) by stereotyping all members of the Toronto Police Services as being racist against blacks..  

How does this decision help their cause or the LGBTQ community?   From most accounts, the presence of the TPS at Pride was welcome."

"Really?  I suggest that you take a poll of many of the inner city churches where the Bergolian concepts ARE alive.  Oh, sorry---this is where African Americans and Hispanics live----and apparently to you---they don't matter.  

Or, how about going to South America---Argentina, for example.  The Church is tilting to the Southern Hemisphere---where the poor live.  ""Go and tell John [the Baptist] what you hear and see: the blind receive their sight, the lame walks, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the poor have good news brought to them.

"As Crawford Kilian has pointed out, regarding refugees coming to Canada: 
""The United Empire Loyalists were refugees. So were the Irish fleeing the potato famine of the 1840s and the black people escaping slavery in the American South. The Doukhobors were Russian refugees. We turned away the Jewish refugees on the St. Louis (“None is too many,” Ottawa decided). But we welcomed the Hungarians in 1956, the Vietnamese and the Ugandan Ismailis in the 1970s. No one worried about Communist spies and terrorists slipping into the country among them.""
Now some Canadians want to pull up the drawbridge. 
Whether we like it or not, we’re in the midst of the greatest displacement of people in human history, and it will only get worse. There are 65 million displaced persons in the world. Canada has taken in 25,000 this year. Not exactly bragging rights.
Refugees have made this county what is today. They can be an asset, not a liability."

"The cure for that is a trip to the Netherlands. The only helmeted cyclists are a) ""road"" cyclists racing, training or cycling at a very high speed, b) small children, especially those still in child seats on mum's or dad's bicycle c) tourists, especially the clueless type. 

The most important factors in cyclist - and pedestrian - safety are proper physical and legal infrastructure (making the more ""powerful"" road user bear the onus, at least in part - a cyclist against a pedestrian, a driver against a cyclist or pedestrian, a HGV (big truck) against all the others) and education for cyclists from a young age. There are tours to the Netherlands and Denmark to study the successful models. Helmets have some usefulness in certain situations but in general they are a diversion from the real issues and yet another way of blaming the victim, not the perpetrators of pollution and road mayhem.

On any day stand at the corner of College and University Avenues in Toronto near four major hospitals and you will see the following sight. A man in ordinary clothes is followed a few steps behind by a woman dressed all in black wearing a niqab. She is pushing a baby carriage and looking after one or more other children. The man does not appear to be helping her in any way.

"Both the researcher and Wente assume that the answers people gave to the question they were asked meant they felt they hadn't been discriminated against. But the question was, “In your day to day life, how often do you feel you have been treated with less respect or courtesy than other people?” it's perfectly possible that, say, African Americans or other people of colour might have taken it for granted that all people like them would usually be treated with little respect or courtesy, so that there was nothing unusual in the disrespect or lack of courtesy they were themselves in fact experiencing and taking for granted. As usual, Wente jumps to a big conclusion based on a tiny bit of evidence that is itself suspect."

 The first Klan flourished in the Southern United States in the late 1860s, then died out by the early 1870s. It sought to overthrow the Republican state governments in the South during the Reconstruction Era, especially by using violence against African American leaders. With numerous chapters across the South, it was suppressed around 1871

"In 2006 when OWOC filed an initiative to stop fluoridation (signed incidentally by more than twice as many voters as this petition) the City sued us to keep it off the ballot.  The case progressed to the Washington Supreme Court where those people lost by a single vote; the Court holding that the addition of fluoride to municipal drinking water was an administrative decision, under the current Code city status. This would not have been the outcome if PA were still a second-class City, where the people have much more control. Remember that the Dred Scott decision of 1859 was at least partly responsible for the Civil War, as it held that blacks were not quite persons, among other things. My point being even the US Supreme Court is not always right. My other point is this: do we really have the right to the initiative process here in PA NOW when the City Fathers can (and do) sue their own citizens to stop majority rule?"

"Russian operatives set up an array of misleading Web sites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior.
The sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook “retargeting” tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.
We could just as easily be describing an effort by the NRA or the RNC.

A Short History of Democrats, Republicans, and Racism
http://russp.us/racism.htm
""Fact: Contrary to popular misconception, the parties never ""switched"" on racism. The Democrats just switched from overt racism to a subversive strategy of getting blacks as dependent as possible on government to secure their votes. At the same time, they began a cynical smear campaign to label anyone who opposes their devious strategy as greedy racists.""
You and quite a few others have fallen into the trap laid out by the dem. party leadership. On the other hand, I honestly think most of the supporters of the dem. party leaders have their heart in the right place they just have been duped. 
I realize the site I posted is a blog site however the facts are there for those who care to look beyond the propaganda fed to them by the party leaders."
"Moderate Democrats have a lot to answer for, mainly because of your all too ready embrace of neoliberal economics after Clinton: NAFTA, GATT, TransPacific, globalization generally.  

Of course, you yahoos also oversaw deindustrialization in the heartland and the criminalization of an entire generation of young black men under the aegis of the War on Drugs. And the Democrats' lukewarm response to AGW only looks good compared to the total inaction of the GOP. It's no coincidence that Hillary lost; you moderate Democrats created the context in which that was possible. 

Here in Oregon, moderate Democrats appear to me to be in the pocket of extractive industries almost as deep as the GOP, even though they spout the requisite environmentalist rhetoric when the situation requires."
"Father Peter Maher was parish priest of St. Joseph Catholic Church Newtown in Sydney's inner west for twenty plus years.  At his Thanksgiving Mass on Retirement just a few days ago, his homily was a beautiful tribute to the inclusive community that has been built at that parish and his thanks to all in the community.  He talked about the growth in awareness of ways in which we discriminate, or ""othering"", seeing those who are not part of the dominant group as ""other"" - to use Mikulich's story line, as Muslim, farmer, African American, Jew.  And as Fr. Peter says:  ""These and many more are not the ""other"" to be feared and kept at arm's length, but people to be included and honoured and valued as sisters and brothers.""

It is well worth reading to see what can be done in a parish community when this ""othering"" is recognized and addressed as part of the faith journey.  The homily is here:  http://newtownfaith.blogspot.com.au"

“I am still Jordan Davis’s mother. His life ended the day he was shot and killed for playing loud music. But my job as his mother didn’t.”
Saying that Hillary Clinton invited the mothers to become a part of the solution, McBath said, “We’re going to keep building a future where police officers and communities of color work together in mutual respect to keep children like Jordan safe. Because the majority of police officers are good people doing a good job.”
Hear that? There was no demonizing of police.
This kind of high-minded spiritual leadership is sorely lacking on the Republican side, which is focused on demonizing Black Lives Matter instead of listening. 
Even in grief, these people want to work with police to build a better future for kids."
"Nigeria and China just inked a major deal where the Chinese will be investing billions of dollars in this depressed economy.   Much to the delight of the destitue Nigerians, in short order they will be owned my the Chinese so perhaps they will put an end to the enslaught."
"It's also fair to say that race-based hate-groups can be laid squarely at the feet of Obama's win, Obama himself and an inflammatory media that sought conflagration of racial divide where it could.

Remember that Obama's win was analyzed through demographics above all else, and that the impact of his win on the living standards of African-Americans came to the forefront repeatedly. Distaste of Obama was placed squarely on racism. And then, when racial tensions did break out, the President was portrayed as anti-cop, pro-BLM and sympathetic to protestors.

The moment Trump was associated with the alt-right by the media, America's hopes at unity were demolished."
"Yes, and the ""Middle Kingdom"" attitude (a genuine belief in the superiority of all that is China and Chinese) has earned them no friends in Africa. Despite their money and inroads they are roundly despised by the people who live there.  They've poured in money and manpower to acquire mines to supply the minerals and ores for their products and their own workers, not the professionals necessary to liaise with the locals but the actual labour at the coalface. They've left little benefit for the people and economies of Africa construction was for their benefit not that of the Africans. No legacy and thoroughly disliked."
"A case of the pot calling the kettle black. I am still waiting for Bush 43 to apologize for promoting a constitutional amendment against gay marriage in his 2004 State of the Union address. Then there is the business about the wars in the Middle East and the irresponsible income tax cuts that took place at about the same time. More than 14 years after the US invasion of Iraq, the Middle East remains an unstable part of the world, millions of people have been displaced and an unknown number have been killed. Although most Americans were untouched by the wars, there is a large protest memorial (put up by a local landowner) across from my local commuter train station. The hillside display is filled with thousands of crosses and other religious symbols, each one marking  a member of the US armed forces who was killed in Iraq or Afghanistan."

Lol you absolutely described every single politician on this planet. Obama spoke to his gullible black supporters. What'd they get. Sky high murder rates amongst themselves and a large percent more poverty. You speak as if this tactic is new. It's certainly not. it certainly isn't a defence of trump but an observation of all politics. Of course you die hard lovers or haters are too blinded by partisanship to see it either way.

Your words don't mean a whole lot to me.... They're just words... They have no impact on anyone... You think you're a SJW.... with your words... Send this to your friends.... Hahahaha... You're the racist one..."
Trump did not say fire black athletes....he said fire the sobs who refuse to stand for the national anthem.  If many of them happen to be black it's not him being a racist.
"Exactly. Obama poured oil over troubled waters, calming people in the wake of what appeared to many to be a huge injustice - the stalking of an unarmed teen who was killed while attempting to save his own life from that armed stalker.

There's quite a contrast between the two presidents, Obama speaking to soothe tempers over a perceived injustice, Trump doubling down on his condemnation of those protesting violence against black citizens, calling them ""sons of b****es. Obama was recognized as a peacemaker, Trump earned the contempt of all decent people.

Obama didn't use the fact of black-on-black crime to justify the verdict, which was not that Trayvon was guilty - he wasn't on trial, he was dead, shot by a creepy self-appointed wanna-be cop; Obama pointed out that the jury found reasonable doubt that the armed creep committed intentional murder. It is you, motley, who is using a statement out of context to justify the killing of a black teen who was doing nothing illegal."

Last I checked, a significant amount of our fruits and veggies is now imported from Mexico, Chile, Australia, etc and the rest that's grown here is done mostly via automation and large industrial machines requiring few humans for manual hard labor. BTW, there are only an estimated 30,000 illegal workers in the entire farming community. A far cry from the 40+ million illegals that reside here and the jobs they stole from Americans. Go ask any black people who has been stealing their jobs for the last 20+ years!"

"The Democrat chickens are coming home to roost!  Thank you Harry Reed!  The Obama two terms in office were just what we needed to clearly see that you can not get prosperity by taxing, regulating, borrowing and spending. This has nothing to do do with the fact that Obama is half black....in fact, he was elected because he WAS black. If it is racism, it is reverse racism.  Oh well!!  The Democrats made this bed and they will be sleeping in it for a very long time.  Trump will be saving the country from going over the cliff with Obama Care....He could have waited for another couple of years until the Democrats were begging him to euthanize Obama Care but unlike his predecessor, he is showing himself to be a statesman and actually working for the benefit of our citizens instead of a historically failed ideology."

"Today the black gangs, the Asian gangs and the Hispanic gangs control the illegal drug trade.   They kill each other and the bystanders at random and to control their turf.  They also work the prostitution rings, of course.

"Some black football players could very well have volunteered and saved this parade. However, I'm not going to blame them. And I'm not sure why you would introduce race into this conversation, unless you are a racist."
Reminder: Trump thinks protest is perfectly fine for neo-Nazis but a firing offense for black athletes.
"You aren't seriously claiming that blacks and Hispanics aren't Christians, are you?  They probably don't wear it on their sleeves as much because it would expose their hypocrisy, particularly with regard to abortion.  They're Democrats because the Welfare System pays them to be, so they put their financial interests ahead of their religious beliefs.

You anti-Christian Democrats are a small minority in your party.  Even the Evangelicals in your party out-number you."
"Sir, the party of Lincoln is not the Republican party of the present.  As soon as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed, Southern dixiecrats moved over to the Republican party so as not to be in the same party as black people.   KKKers are Republican, now."
"Perhaps it has something to do with the fact that most predominately black countries are a violent mess, that blacks are involved in gangs and shootings all across the US and Canada, that our social housing projects are packed full with blacks who cannot afford to live in this country, and that many of them have difficulty in school. Other races tend to do better. The black community should be asking themselves what they can do to change how people perceive them."
"What  I wrote was: "" It sometimes seems that every time one mentions some crime done to Black people, the response offered is that they deserve it, in a sense, that they incurred the harm as a result of their own deficiencies.""  I could have been more explicit, and said ""...it sometimes seems to me..."" but I'd thought it clear that I was speaking for myself.

I don't think it ridiculous to believe that families would be strong if parents were proper parents. Neither is it ridiculous to think schools would have an easier time doing their job if they didn't have to contend with behavioral issues among their children.  What I was trying to get at was a stance I often encounter,  that upon considering these truisms, Black people are properly understood to be responsible for the wretchedness of so many of their schools, for the uncongenial aspects of their neighborhoods, the vexations they experience around employment, the disparities in policing,

Remember the Pope who declared that  native South Americans were animals and so they could be slaughtered in order that the Spanish and Portuguese could steal their lands. Remember the Pope who declared that black Africans had no souls and so they could be used as slaves in the colonies to benefit the wealth of the Jesuit sugar plantations! Get educated about infallibility!"

"You keep using the word proud when that's not what I understand he feels about his cakes. And it's unimportant anyway.  He asserts that it would be against his religious beliefs to make a cake for a gay wedding because he does not support the gay lifestyle.  No one said he is asking people their sexuality.  And an artist is not compelled to make art for just anyone.  I am not saying that he is an artist (you really like to say things that I haven't said), I am saying that he has a decent case and it's not a slam dunk, as so many asset, that he loses.  And you seem to be confusing selling art with creating commissioned art. As I said earlier, if they came in to buy say a piece of cake, he would have to sell it to them.  However they commissioned a cake to be made and he refused.  Why would black people be discriminated on religious basis?   Black people tend to be very religious.  You are asserting something that is ridiculous.  He and God can take up his hypocrisy.  That's not for me."
These players are a joke . The very fact they have high paying jobs just to play a game shows America is a country that gives everyone a chance to be the best they can be and is a country to be proud of .  Since they have the right to take a knee---does that mean I have the right to use the N word any time I want ?  I'd never do that since it would be disrespectful to them---just as they are being disrespectful of the very country that puts the food on they're table .   The NFL has clear cut rules that tells the players they must stand while they are on the job . The second they enter the arena they are on the clock . Why doesn't the NFL enforce it's own clear cut rules ?   I'm one of those who will change the channel when games come on until these over paid players stop disrespecting America .  And in other news---last week footage was shown of a youth football team made up of about 10 years old's . The kids took a knee .  What are the odds they're black coaches were behind it ?

"Actually, I have been to two of those I mentioned. Not a great idea, just necessary at the time. 
One of my fondest memories is telling a story to a black soldier friend about Major Tom Egan being in Oakland after dark and his response:

"I don't see how you can fault the sentence for being misleading. I mean, it says right there that he was black, male, and young.  That alone is evidence of a clear and present danger. And that a police officer shot him proves it. Any right-thinking person would automatically know that Brown was far from innocent. There is no need to repeat his sordid particulars. I really can't see any inaccuracy here. 

Properly, all the dangerous young Black men I know get rousted by police officers. So far, they have been able to curb their violent natures enough to spare the officers the necessity of shooting them. At 14, D.J.  can choke down his foolish angst at being thrown against a car, cuffed and sat on a curb, while the milk he was sent to purchase turns sour. But the wanton criminality bred into him could show itself eventually.  One day, it may even surface as an ill-conceived expression of indignation.

You approve torture, murder, disappearances, poisonings... by claiming that these happened in defense against an evil threat. People like you will always find an excuse in order to justify their wrongdoings.

It's because of uncivilised and self-righteous bigots like you that South Africa makes so very little progress in processing and overcoming (in contrast to: ignoring and forgetting) it's past!

"The attitude and hostility that underlies the thinly veiled Muslim immigration ban, for example, is something which has been seen before and is well understood by the black community. 
____________________________________________________

The ban is stupid. That being said...calling it a Muslim ban is deliberately misleading as there are many Muslim countries not included on the list. The ban specifically applies to countries that the American's are currently conducting military operations in + Iran.  Minority groups in these countries being persecuted are exempt from the ban."

"This is sad on a number of fronts. Firstly Paul or Paula is a male, so it's a 'he' regardless how he may feel.

Second, the slavery or heliocentric exemples as old 'Christian ' beliefs that are now outdated is at least ignorant, there is nothing in the Bible that supports chattel slavery, nor heliocentrism. Absolutely nothing! Thirdly, a church embracing the gay or transgender lifestyle as pleasing to God is no longer practicing Christianity, rather their own invented religion. The church is to welcome all but Not condone all behavior. If this mans original church mistreated him that's wrong but they were quite within their rights to fire him provided they did so in a fair and equitable manner. If an Imam on a mosque became a Hindu, he no longer hold Islams values so why should he not be fired?"
"Dolan's 'wisdom' (prideful choice) re: personal participation on Black Friday is deplorable.

To the legions of Catholic walkaways, hereabouts and elsewhere, if they even momentarily notice Dolan's puffery, it will be 'ho hum, church business as usual.'"
"Agreed, but why do you want police to perpetuate a retribution towards a group that is already upset at police?

Police treat gays and blacks poorly, this is historically documented. So gays and blacks protest by excluding them in the parade and send the message, they're tired of being treated poorly.  So now you want police to react to that ""stop treating us poorly message"", by further treating them poorly.

You logic is obtuse to say the least."
"The NFL players want the scrutiny of the police in the black communities to stop, let the gang bangers know.  The gang bangers are what draws it.  It's time to put up or shut up, you condone the illegal activity in your neighborhoods, you get the police presence.  Get in the community and put an end to the killing and drug dealing, that will help more than taking a knee.  Keep the gangs from recruiting the youth into a life of crime, that will help more than taking a knee.  Quit blaming the police for the ills of your community, that will help more than taking a knee."
"""Even if a person is homosexual, they are demonstrating that by conducting an activity in private.""

Homosexual activity is found all throughout nature in different ways, all over the world - is it really that hard for you to believe that as humans, with a much more evolved brain than any other animal on this planet, we are sometimes born being attracted more to people of the same sex?"

Then why do Black people kill more Black people more than any other race?  Why are Black people more prone to violent acts than any other demographic group in America?

Who will lecture Black people on this inconvenient truth?   Not NCR, that's for sure."
"i hate racism. i think it is obscene.  i think i t goes both ways.  that said -  there is a line crossed when it's people who are police that are targeted .  they are the people who DO put their lives on the line for the public.  the service the police provide the public  is by no means done fairly, equally, honorably, unbiased, without ulterior motives, altruistically, etc, etc.  some cops , on-duty cops,  exhibit every evil that exists in the world.   they are relative to the total, but a small number of cops  are just bad, some real bad - had one in the family.  but, as a job,  these ARE the people who show up when most others would run.  they DO protect.  they DO save lives.  targeting cops or targeting soldiers - just wrong. not to say they are top notch individuals, but as a group - they deserve respect. the shooter targeted a group - i'll bet not one cop killed had ever killed a black person - or  any person. eye for  an eye? not the answer."
"For those of us who are older, we remember the raised arm with closed fist at the  olympics years ago.  The manner of protest is equally expressive of the treatment given to Africa-Americans, Moslems, or anyone who believes they are percecuted in the US.  The right to protest is quaranteed in the Constitution.  So Agent Orange is likely ignoring his Presidential requirement to defend the Constitution.  As such, he is able to be impeached.  How ironic that African-American sportsman and women could bring down a President.  Better if he cancelled his Twitter account and acted an a rational human being."

"Working from that human-created script just like the black pastors perform each Sunday as they pass the collection plates to enrich their own lifestyle.  Like Prevo, living large on tax exempt largesse gleaned from the gullible dupes based on an invisible power unseen and unheard by anyone ever.  Duplicate ideology to Il Duce Trump for the gleaning of the brainwashed idolators willing to cut their own throats for a laying on of hands and false promises to allay any life reality.  Leaders of the Old South Slave religions still keeping their parishioners in line to lead them into the tiny hands of the new Plantation Prince."
"Poor old Donald Trump, lamenting the good old days when there was more hitting in football, when black men knew their place and all was supposedly golden hued in his privileged world. 

Sadder still, all of Trump's best days probably ARE behind him.  He can't seem to grow into the job he now holds and so he lashes out, even using the most powerful pulpit in the world to call athletes SOBs and preach an NFL boycott because it's “Not the same game anymore, anyway.”

What a waste of everyone's time and a danger when he tries the same tactics with North Korea.

Trump's an object lesson in how not to grow old gracefully.
Among other things."
"I was so excited to eat at Mi Mero Mole until I found out that the owner, Nick Zukin, was racist and so dismissive of Black Lives Matter.

I'm grateful that this very real issue with Saffron has brought much more about Portland businesses into the light and caused folks to dig deeper into who they support.

Smart business owners should do the right thing and use this opportunity to sympathize with the community (who is rightfully outraged) with the result of likely earning that community's support and winning  them over to their business (much like Ristretto Roasters did) rather than PUBLICLY expressing support and shooting themselves in the proverbial foot. It doesn't look like Nick Zukin is that kind of business owner. I suppose some people just like to commit business-suicide.

It's amazing how arrogant business owners like Sally and Nick are to think that Portland has enough racists or racist-sympathizers to keep their restaurants afloat."

"The national conversation is a mixture of both good and bad so far, some helpful, some divisive. I was thinking of the employment committee you were on when there may have been no blacks present. The black applicants being ""lost"" would not have even known they were being discriminated against unless someone like you spoke up in that situation. I would prefer we get to the point where we don't consider race as even existing, rather we are all just human beings. But I would also prefer that cultural differences still exist and be appreciated rather than being yet another source of animosity. In the case of those who legally emigrate (and certainly not by force or illegally) to a new country, they must be willing to assimilate to some degree while maintaining their cultural identity, such as being willing to learn the local language and understand and obey local laws and constitutions, as well as appreciate the culture of their new home. Otherwise, go elsewhere."
Where in any comment did I base USA as a success. I didn't. I listed all failures of socialism.  Not once did I mention capitalism. Then you cheap shot bush and I assume trump when I look at failures I look at debt and neither of those 2 even compare to obama. He was by far the most horrid. Not only debt but divisiveness increased ten fold from obama. The blacks are in far worse shape as well unless you count being on welfare as success.

"Skyofblue are you trying to engage in ""alternative facts""? It's not going to work. This woman used the N-word publicly to refer to a black woman complaining about racial discrimination. There is no excuse for it. Elgie also had a prior history of inappropriate behaviour. This woman likely was a lifelong racist who in her old age thought she could continue the same behaviour that would have been common in the 1950's without having the good sense to know that the 21st century would catch up and deal with her."

"Eight years ago Obama won, people in their 50's, 60's proudly stated they voted for the first time, they voted in an historical election, voted in the first black President.  Is this going to be true in this election?  only its the first Woman.  Qualifications mean nothing, Clinton is playing up this, the press written and spoken playing it up.  The qualifications of the previous President, first, black, has not been good, so forget being the First when you vote.  The women in our military, those serving on our ships, met the qualifications ( the same men must go through), those women who wish to serve on the front lines, the special forces, met the qualifications that men must meet.  It is not about being a Woman, a Black, what ever, it is about being Qualified. If you vote, reason being The First, please don't brag about it, you have shown disrespect to those running and the purpose of voting.  Hang a sign around your neck, I voted for the first woman President, issues what issues?"
"Yes you are very accurate. And they had other names for black people and I do not mean the N word, but those were acceptable then - not today of course but no one was trying to be mean."
"The definition of “Black” is in the Amended Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Codes of Good Practice gazetted on 10 October 2014 (“the Amended Codes”) and the wording follows the Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment Act 2013 (“the Act”):

“Black people” is a generic term which means Africans, Coloureds and Indians -

(a) who are citizens of the Republic of South Africa by birth or descent;

or [my emphasis]

(b) who became citizens of the Republic of South Africa by naturalisation -

	(i) before 27 April 1994; or
	(ii) on or after 27 April 1994 and would have been entitled to acquire citizenship by naturalisation prior to that date.

Hence, by becoming citizens and self identifying as ""Indian"", the Guptas are defined as ""black"" and therefore benefit considerably from B-BBEE"
"How do you know 99% of commenters have never had an experience of being singled out? Is it conceivable that they simply don't agree with her assumptions and approach to dealing with these experiences? I'm a POC working on Bay Street, and certainly find the author's attitude troubling. For instance, she thinks taking off early to play ultimate frisbee should be attributed equal importance as the need to pick kids up from school... Really?

Let me rephrase it with facts and reality:
Canadians knows very much how lucky we've been. Through our 150 years of history, we smartly created a new country to shield ourselves from the epic national blow up in the U.S. called Civil War. A country of slavery and deep racism towards blacks, imperial expansion towards the west via war and genocide on natives. The lawlessness of the Wild West is legend. An ambitious America who shameless stole all that can be stolen from the British Empire. Then, just when Canada able to catch a breadth, its imperial master the UK proceeded to wage two epic world wars on Europe and the world. In the name of empire, colonialism."

Someone, somewhere is going to be offended...accept that fact and quit trying to hand everyone a participation trophy.  This goes for everyone by the way, but if you want to be treated as equal, you must first see yourself as equal.  The moment you separate yourself out as different, you are no longer equal.  When people understand that then maybe, just maybe things will change.  Until then, well here we are...and here's your trophy...I guess."
"> U of T has also offered to help the college with its diversity training.

Yet there were black students there to be offended. 

This really does sound like an off-hand joke that has been blown way out of proportion. But I suppose that is the atmosphere on university campuses these days.

The other posted implied the NRA was racist because they didn't rush out to defend ""the black man that legally possessed a concealed weapon."" I simply explained he didn't legally possess his weapon.  Then you seemed to want to argue about it.  

So you tell me, now what?"
"You are accusing the black student of being ""humourless"" for  reacting so vehemently to a joke about the ""lash"" and a ""master""?
Of course, Massey should not have automatically caved to the students' demands. And it appears Marrus has a long and distinguished academic record, and should not be judged on one out-of-character incident.
However, it is not hard to understand why black people get so upset about incidents like this when people like you still -- in 2017 -- think centuries of slavery, lynching and lashing is worth a laugh."
"Because it's a much bigger problem that the liberal mass-media won't cover because of the political agenda.  In 2016 apx 250 Blacks were killed by police nationwide. The majority of those shootings were investigated and deemed justified.  Up to this point in 2017, almost 480 people have been shot and killed in Chicago and over 2200 have been wounded, the majority of he assaults being Black on Black.  Mr. Cho, it's willful ignorance like yours that is a major contribution to this cultural downfall we are experiencing here in the US"
Being friends with Russia and working together to make the world a safer place is not a bad idea!  As for the KKK he disavowed that long ago and many times since.  But with those Black Lives Matter idiots running around making no sense with their protests maybe we do need a strong and visible KKK for a few weeks to get them to work on making their communities a safer and better place to live but they are so worried about losing their welfare and food stamps and maybe actually having to get a job and work for a living!  I predict within two years we all will be demanding that he changes Mount Rushmore to Mount Trump via Executive Order!
Was there a Black Election where John Lewis was elected representative of all American Blacks? I missed it I guess.
"You don't even know what the ""issues"" are. And neither do these players. This is all a lazy publicity stunt by spoiled, entitled  children.

You said that the USA would not exist without black and brown folks. And then you said it would be more civil like Canada. So you are suggesting that the black and Brown folks are why we are less civil than Canada. That just seems bizarre. And you also introduced the topics of race and slavery into a discussion about a Christmas parade. Weird.
"Beg to differ today Shannyn. Margaret Stock is the most qualified and experienced candidate running for the US Senate seat this year. Writing in Mark will only dilute the vote and guarantee a win for Lisa just as happened last time when so many Alaskans running scared from Miller wrote in Murkowski's name rather than voting for Scott McAdams. Any moral purity vote for a third party presidential candidate with no hope of even breaking 15% will be a vote for the most undisciplined, boorish, misogynistic racist ever to become the candidate for a major political party. Get over your self righteousness and realize there is no choice in this election for women, people of color and people who think rather than emotionally react than Secretary of State/Senator Hillary Clinton. You have fallen for the anti Hillary propaganda but need to get over it. Keep in mind the sexpot Jessica toon character from Who Framed Roger Rabbit when she laments, ""I'm not bad it's just the way they drew me"""

"Basically it is non interference by government.
We have put our economy in a straitjacket and we complain it is not working. So what do we do? We tighten the buckles.
Liberate the economy. Get rid of the BBBEE (especially on small businesses) and AA and watch the economy explode. Blacks will be absorbed into the system, in management and ownership etc, simply because they have to be. The market will decide it. Currently we need BBBEE and AA because we have hobbled the economy and positions are severely limited. 
What we have now is not working. Instead of amplifying what is not working lets try something new. Something that has worked elsewhere. Let us not be another Venezuela."

"Commenter asks the question ""Who put the blacks in in the inner-cities?"" Wink, wink - implication that the deed was the work of the Democrats. Frankly, the answer is no.  During the two great migration periods where blacks left the south in mass and moved north, MOST settled in N.Y., Chicago, Philadelphia, Detroit, Minneapolis, Seattle, Boston, Baltimore, Oakland, St. Louis, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C.  If we look at the party in charge in most cities during the period (1910 - 1950), the cities were under control of Republicans.  Blacks moving into northern cities were welcomed by various forms of economic discrimination - higher insurance rates, banks refusing to lend, access to well-paying jobs were limited.  This meant that ethnic minorities were restricted as to where they could live - depicted quite well in David Cutler's work entitled Rise and Decline of the American Ghetto."

""Slate's audience is ranked as one of the most liberal when compared to other mainstream media outlets.  Slate is also known (and sometimes criticized) for adopting contrarian positions, giving rise to the term ""Slate Pitches"".  

I have to agree with most of the decisions and positions of those prosecutors cited in the article.

The US Supreme Court has upheld our Jury system numerous times and our death penalty standards as well.

The number of convicted black people is pretty much equal to the number of black people committing the crimes.  And most of those crimes are against other black people, from drive-bys where six year old girls are killed, multiple murders and assaults outside strip joints and gang fights over drugs and prostitution. to just cover this year's Portland crime scene."
"I don't see anything through a theory at all. I know plenty of people like you, and I think you're ruining the country. That's not a theory, its my experience.

You have no clue what the cultural background of the people of Norway is. All you know is that black and latino 'thugs' are dangerous and need thick concrete. That's why I call your post racially motivated.

Norwegians are pretty similar to us and I challenge you to point out one of these differences you keep going on about."
"You both are wrong.  Police need reasonable suspicion that a person is engaged in a crime or about to commit a crime.  If a person is hanging outside a store that has been robbed, the police can articulate the need to stop and determine his dealings.  It's called a Terry Stop and has been confirmed legal several times by the Supreme Court.  You need Probable Cause to arrest a person for a crime you suspect them of committing.  A warrant doesn't even come into effect until the person has not shown for court or has been found to be charged by a District Attorney.  The community is woefully inept on what actually the law is that they have built their opinions around innuendo and guessing.  I'm glad  someone finally wrote an article from another perspective, now they need to delve into why the black community is contacted by the police more than any other race and more inclined to be involved in a deadly encounter."

"The statement by Idil Issa about women being made out to be the blackest of political demons, the most frightening of ghost is something extremely hard to swallow.  I actually think it is a travesty to say that; what Canadians want is that these women who  come from areas where they do not count much would feel enlightened to be able to show their face, their hands; they are free to throw the burka away as they should so they will become a ""delightful ghost"" and as her fellow sister help to free her of this demeaning garb.  By all means stick to your hijab but please show you face everywhere, surely your men can control their ""urges""!"
"Affirmative Action (AA), a product of liberal Democrat thinking, contradicted the Equal rights Act, and resulted in an unnecessary irritation on the part of the one racial group that needed to erase a century-old mindset. AA was the first action of what would become a whole philosophy of politics. I don't care who invented the term, Identity Politics, but its practice was the special tool of the Democratic Party, which also originated the practice of Gerrymandering. If by Equal Rights, you actually mean racial antagonism, I lay that directly at the feet of the Democrats, who started by opposing the freeing of slaves, then opposed the Civil Rights Act, then discovered that ""there's gold in them thar votes"" and started pandering to the blacks for their votes. So long as they an keep the flames of victimization burning, they keep racism alive, and this fake ""victim"" emotion resulted in the natural reaction of racism against. Yes, there is more racism in this country now than 8 years ago."
"I think that Neil Degrasse-Tyson had the best response to this kind of argument. He pointed out that when he was growing up, literally no one in his school or larger learning environment encouraged his interest in astrophysics. Instead, because he was black, his teachers kept pushing him towards sports. He was telling this story in response to a question about the lack of women in the sciences. The upshot of his response was to say that before people began making categorical statements about how people are biologically different, we need to know that social and environmental factors are really controlled for and are not decisively at play. That argument continues to apply here. It may be true that different kinds of biological factors affect the disposition and interests of men and women in general terms. However, we need to construct an environment that allows for individuals to make their own choices. Generalizing about groups of people discourages those exceptional individuals."
"Suitable time for the removal of these CSA relics now that the policies for which they fought are now fully embedded in the national government of Neo-CONfederate Republicans led by a slave-holding Plantation holder.

"I am completely, in opposition to your theories that flags and monuments to apartheid, or, to any other 'isms'  in past history, be destroyed.   You are continuing, to over-protect a population which, so far, has failed in achieving, any success of its own.  Witness the ANC.  And the crazy mad destruction of statues of Rhodes, etc.   Which simply, obliterate,  the history of the country.  How? Are we going to be reminded, of our history, if all symbols of that sometimes, hugely, destructive past, are destroyed.  Are you encouraging,  a repeat of all that same racism, corruption, this time in favour of the black population? 
If, you witnessed the walk of Pope Francis,  (Papa Fransi, as we call him),  at Dachau, near Munich, Germany, where the man walked alone, lost in grief and contemplation, of the awful past.  You would realise, that flags, monuments, are constant reminders,  please note,  of our past, and where we no longer wish to go.  Remove them, and repetition is inevitable."

"Right!

The ""David Koresh"" (Vernon Rowell) nutcases started the fire themselves, with a death wish as lethal as ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""Jonestown"" leadership.

Koresh physically abused children in the compound and committed statutory rape by taking multiple underage brides. He advocated polygamy for himself and declared himself married to several residents. Koresh declared he was entitled to at least 140 wives, he was entitled to claim any of the females in the group as his, he had fathered at least a dozen children, and that some of these mothers became brides as young as 12 or 13. In addition to allegations of sexual abuse and misconduct, Koresh and his followers were suspected of stockpiling illegal weapons. McLennan County's Sheriff called the ATF to notify them that his office had been contacted by a local UPS representative. A UPS driver described a package that had broken open on delivery to the Branch Davidian residence, revealing firearms, inert grenade casings, and black powder."

This march might have been about farmers, but it is also serving to focus attention on all crimes! It has often been said, that in a Western-style democracy such shocking crime statistics would result in the firing of the government. Let it happen here, that the people of South Africa force the resignation of this government which has served its own interests at every turn, and demand the appointment of a president and cabinet who are not only dedicated to the service of their populace, but who are honest and competent in their jobs! We have tolerated these less-than-mediocre leaders for far too long, enabled their corruption to our own detriment, and as a result innocent men, women and children have died.

Mr. Phillips' main business is making custom-designed wedding cakes. He refused to design a wedding cake for a gay couple solely because they were gay. He wil sell them only generic cakes, not custom-designed ones. They never discussed design. You keep forgetting that fact. Mr. Phillips doesn't refuse to design wedding cakes for straight couples solely because the couples are black or inter-racial or inter-religious.
You seem to labor under the delusion that there is a ""gay wedding cake"" or that gay or lesbian couples want wedding cakes with ""gay themes"". Most gay couples simply want a custom-design cake. Just like a straight couple.
You still want conservative Christian businesses to be able to refuse service to any customer -- as long as the customer is gay or a gay couple."

"Without denying our desperate need to--for the sake of our own survival--address the inextricably-linked issues of unsustainable human population growth, and criminally inequitable misappropriation of natural resources, it's nonetheless necessary to point out that environmental degradation due to human-engendered invasive species is an ongoing and deadly threat not only to other native species, but to ourselves.  And cats are among the worst species in that regard.

Having said that, your argument is merely an (unusually carefully-stated) example of the logical fallacy of deflection, and no more sensible than arguing that we should ignore cancer because heart disease kills far more people.  Or that those Texas klansmen who dragged a black gentleman behind their pickup until his HEAD popped off in 2008 shouldn't have been imprisoned because the Da'esh (""ISIS"") behead far more people.

This is in fact one of the cat-nutters' most frequently resorted-to fallacies."
"It doesn't matter if it's in the US or Rawanda.   The fact is still the same.  Furthermore, there is no evidence that backs up your claim.  impunity=exemption from punishment.  Police officers that shot civilians are tried like any other citizen.   Data also shows police violence against black men is actually rare.   The current narrative stating otherwise is false, simply to promote an agenda.  the real crime is the perpetual poverty facing blacks.   27% of the US is black, 13% live in poverty.  That is what should be addressed, not taking cops and turning them into scapegoats.

"Quote from Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood: Woman, Morality, and Birth Control. New York: New York Publishing Company, 1922. Page 12.
""We should hire three or four colored ministers, preferably with social-service backgrounds, and with engaging personalities.  The most successful educational approach to the Negro is through a religious appeal. We don’t want the word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members."" Are you referring to that Eugenics?"
"Obama would have gotten nowhere with his policies were it not for a corrupt, lapdog press, an ideologically driven academia, and an American idol pop culture that only cared that we had our first black president. Republican opposition to his policies has been a sad joke on the people that gave them two landslide elections. 

This president and his party have only one goal as far as immigration goes and that is to flood this country with third world dependent people that will eventually gain citizenship and vote democrat in perpetuity. Sad thing is that the next generations will not really know what was frittered away by this generation as they pay off the credit card that was run up just to make this president look good and keep the current population docile. You refugee/ immigrant supporters need to look closely at what's happening over in ""enlightened Europe"" for a glimps of this nation's future if you don't get a clue. No one has a right to come here. Hey, how do ya spell glimps?"
"I do not accuse the G&M of failing to correct errors in reporting but the policies of major  US news networks do not meet that standard. I try to avoid the ridiculous slanted coverage by FOX and MSNBC so after many winters in Florida I see a lot of CNN.

A CNN anchor continuously claimed that Zimmerman did not suffer any injury. While that anchor was booted back to England I never saw a correction by CNN. CNN did continue to harp about racism and the stand your ground law even though facts and law contradicted them. They even ran a whitewashed documentary about the guy who got the Watts riots started in what appeared to be an attempt to fan black anger at that time. They were critical of the MSNBC anchor who altered the 911 tape to make it sound like Zimmerman was racist but even that act was not enough to get the anchor dismissed. When a network will keep a ""reporter"" who deliberately falsified a story, why would we not be wary of reporters?"
"The inevitable backlash against this will be Trump-like administration that will set their agenda back by decades AND cause collateral damage elsewhere.

Black Liberation Collective in this case is acting not unlike Hitler youth - attacking everyone who isn't seen enthusiastically supporting their case."
"Eh.  All you've come up with so far is you don't like her hair-do and that according to you poor people on welfare bankrolled her into office, and the unsubstantiated accusation that she got her position because she was black (I'll bet you say that to ALL the successful black ladies, you little charmer, you...).

And you say MY comments are devoid of intellect?  To paraphrase a very popular Galilean carpenter: “Mote. Beam.”"
"Other than federal tax, if you work, identify what other taxes you pay that go to the needy, Black."
Name one city in the western world where black people are truly law abiding.
"I have a real problem with anything trumping the First Amendment. Universities are the traditional site of our best and most open ""marketplace of ideas"". Racist crap should be permitted so that everyone can see how little value it has.

As far as Prof. Shurtz goes, let's just say that while her costume shouldn't cause her to be disciplined, her lame expressions of ignorance perhaps should. How can a person, supposedly educated in our culture, which is what law is, be ignorant of what black-face is and means and claim with a straight face to not know the term? I have to wonder about her qualifications for her position."
"Ronin,you dotard,Donald DotaRd said it wasn't about black athletes. Said it right before boarding DE jet."
"To think Black lives matter, where are they when it happens to black on black?"
And both sides didn't lynch innocent blacks. Only one side did that. See? I fixed it for you.
"Yes, that was a racist comment, and its author is an embarrassment to whatever creed he professes.

That said, note that there is racism on both sides.  Consider Black Lives Matter.   BLM teaches that Black lives are systematically and intentionally targeted for demise.  BLM is committed to disrupting the nuclear family structure, advocating Black “villages” where they support each other as extended families.  BLM is also committed to dismantling so-called “cis-gender privilege.”  They are working to rebuild the Black liberation movement, based on the idea that virulent anti-Black racism permeates our society.  They teach that the imprisonment of black people state violence.  You be the judge."
So is Pence protesting the fact that black athletes are protesting their treatment in the USA? I can't figure out if this lacks more of common sense or class?
"Black on black deaths only matter in FBI statistics. They haven't for decades in Portland, Chicago, Baltimore  etc etc etc."
"Ask your black friends what it's like to be black in Oregon, and ask them if they've ever been stopped by the police."
"Please tell, what is a 'real Canadian'? As for the rest of your diatribe, he only true reflection is that Obama is the first black President. I take it that anyone who disagrees with your interpretation of said article are ' the dregs, the finger pointers, the malcontent and above all the pitiful, malignant, murderous racists"", your comment, not mine."
"The worst thing is that the supposed ""patriots"" like trump and those so incensed by seeing black players silently and peacefully protesting racial injustice during the anthem that they are claiming to boycott the NFL, had no thoughts of boycotting the NFL because of players who commit violence against women. 

Jerry Jones threatens to bench his players if they don;t stand for the anthem but he had no problem hiring and playing Greg Hardy the wife beater. And he fought hard to prevent the NFL from suspending Elliot the girlfriend beater (though yay! he lost).

I didn't hear any calls for boycotts when Jamis the rapist, came into the league. How long did Sebastien Rapeykowski play without a peep from fans? How about Big Ben Rapistburger accused twice and bought his way out with settlements. No boycotts for him. 

Seems like a poignant commentary on our nation. Violence against women? Meh. Black men protesting? How dare they!"
"For all those who claim that kneeling is disrespect to flag and country are dead wrong, period. The only disrespect is unarmed people are being killed by those sworn to protect. Since we are referring to Black Americans in these instances, I would have you know that Black Americans fought in every war America has waged. This is fact and here's the first......In 1770, Crispus Attucks, a black man, became the first casualty of the American Revolution when he was shot and killed in what became known as the Boston Massacre. This in a time where Mr. Attucks could not even be counted as a citizen. Look in the mirror and repeat after me, ..... I'm not allowed to be a citizen, but I can die for your tea? The ultimate disrespect!"
"What a bunch of Bolshevik dezenformatzia that was.  The Georgetown professor states, ""people think black people are violent and dangerous.""
Professor, without having  to drag out all the uniform crime statistics again, people don't just think that, they know that.
But then, he's a college professor."
"Drake is half black. Being a Jew is not a race its a set of ideas like other religions.
Ivanka Trump is Jewish because she converted nothing to do with this talk about race and other nonsense."
So what your data is saying is that minorities commit a disproportionate amount of crime. 22% of murder suspects were black while they represent only 5.9% of the population. You're being intellectually dishonest in an effort to appear not racist.
"If the nurse was black this country would be in flames by now.  In any event, the officer will be punished."
"I get it. You HAD to vote for a man who was busted for committing illegal housing discrimination against black Americans. Your commitment to ""freedom and liberty"" commanded you.  You had to vote for a man who barged into the dressing room at the Miss Teen USA pageant to ogle UNDERAGE girls. Your commitment to ""family values"" commanded you. You had to vote for the 6 time bankrupt billionaire who repeatedly stiffed his creditors and the subcontractors who were stupid enough to trust him. Because your ""fiscal responsibility"" commanded you. You had to vote for a guy who does all his manufacturing overseas while paying lip service to ""America First"". Your economic ""patriotism"" commanded you.  Pfffft. 

There were 22 presidential candidates on Colorado's 2016 ballot. You could have chosen 20 other candidates besides Trump or Clinton. Don't deflect to Clinton. If you voted for Trump, you own it. I don't ever want to hear about ""values"" from you on this board. With all due respect."
"Um, if you understood anything about the industry you wouldn't, um, post nonsense like that."
So they replace a man who wanted the south to keep blacks as slaves with a man whose political party depends on keeping blacks enslaved. Makes sense.
What makes Trudeau Butts happy is giving away 10 million to terrorists and watching black clad anonymous leftist thugs beating Canadian senior citizens bloody on CBC TV.
"Disagreeing with Elvi Gray-Jackson does not make you a ""racist"".  When I first saw her comments in the ADN I didn't agree with her and I have clue or care what race she was.  When I first saw her picture my first thought wasn't that she was black, it was that she looked like the Joker."
by the way. I phrased that question wrong. .what did he do for blacks?  what the hail did he do for mississippi?  this is where I live..and if I'm not mistaken he never sat a foot here in 8 dam years.  I don't even remember him coming here when he campaigned the first time. some blacks are soooooooooooooooo.....  never mind
"I agree - Obama was no more than a dream, a sick fantasy that implied that an unskilled, untried black man could actually do something good for the country (not just make people feel good for electing a black person) and he failed totally.

Now we have switched trains and so far, the track is looking clear and we are moving forward. If the hypocrites would sober up, accept their defeat and quit attacking everything he does they would likely find out we are on a far better path - obviously they are afraid of that..

You speak of 'paranoid' - you are labeling the left IN MASS!"
"have you not been witnessing this election cycle? 
what are these ""values and morals"" you speak of?

did the erosion of ""values and morals"" begin when black citizens were allowed to vote, or was it when we let women vote?

guess what BB, you know many people that use cannabis, you just don't know it! 
good Americans who get up every morning and go to work and are productive members of society. they pay their taxes they buy Coca Cola and Chevrolets and they enjoy baseball.

"Who knew the Globe was a staunch defender of the KKK's rights. After all, the KKK cloak represents religious purity, prejudice against homosexuals, anti-semitism - and so does the niqab, all over the world, without exception.  But the niqab means feminism and modesty in Canada (just Canada). I'm still waiting for the Globe's piece in the Life section with three Klansmen pushing their kids on swings in the park - they just wear the cloak for modesty and to represent their faith, nothing to do with support of violence towards homosexuals and Jews... does this sound ridiculous, because it is  - let's defend a symbol that is synonymous with violence against homosexuals - as the niqab is most common in countries that punish homosexuality with jail or worse (often the death penalty). But in Canada it means modesty and independence - the niqab's supporters are pathetic. Let's encourage a symbol that is only common in countries where women are treated like second class citizens..."
"The ages of rape victims in South Africa are from as young as a few months old to as high as one hundred years. It is almost routinely accompanied by excessive violence. Lesbian women are especially vulnerable. 

My moms' 85 year old friend was gang raped while being tied up next to her invalid husband.

It seems Jacob Zuma is the rule and not the exception. He impregnated the daughter of another of his closest friends. Zuma was the highest ranking official in the ANC's Department of Intelligence and Security- aka Imbokodo where the rape of young ANC members was rife.

"Disproportionately:

Blacks committed about 55% of the murders, despite making up only 13% of the population.  Disproportionately.

Blacks were responsible 88% of the time, when another black person was murdered, despite making up only 13% of the population.  Disproportionately.

30% of all criminal arrests are of blacks, despite making up only 13% of the population. Disproportionately.

40% of the time that a police officer is murdered, it is by a black male, despite making up only 7% of the population.  Disproportionately.
Source: FBI Expanded Homicide Tables #3 and 6, and others.

Correlation is not causation.  Being black does not cause you to commit crimes.

However, if you are DISPROPORTIONATELY involved in a higher number of police ""criminal interactions/interdictions"", you might get shot at a DISPROPORTIONATELY higher rate (26%).

I know.  Big Numbers.  They mean things."
"I knew the NFL would cave in, after making a big show of their so-called respect for player’s Personal expression.  Nothing is more political than the NFL, in a conservative direction of course.  Now we see what a charade their principled stance was, as they threaten the players with job loss if they refuse to accept the NFL’s empty definition of patriotism.  Don’t these black men know that their jobs are to put their bodies on the line for our entertainment, and to keep their mouths shut about the brutalizations that regularly occurs in their communities at the hands of police?"
"Indulging in political masturbation and fancy irrelevant historical facts and manufacturing ghost enemies while ignoring the insult, disrespect and contempt with which the Guptas have treated the South African citizens. Just remember that by your silence you have betrayed us. You and your ilk have made some black South Africans to start talking about apartheid in nostalgic terms. Yes, it is true. Get on the trains, the taxis and the buses and you will hear ordinary South Africans lamenting alk the sacrifices they made to put you in government."
"Kimaren, your bias/prejudice is blatantly obvious !  But, then, its part of the mindset.  We blame Blacks for their mentality of playing the victim, demanding everything for free, venality etc. , but its like not seeing the beam in your own eye."

"You're missing the point.  It's NOT that a diversified person was picked - Ian Hanomansing has been reading the news for a while, so he alone would have been perfectly qualified.

But why four anchors?  And why the nauseating nod to uber-political-correctednesss by trying to cover all bases by picking a French woman, an Anglo, an east Asian, and a south Asian (oops forgot the black person, forgot the arabic person, forgot the aboriginal... etc. etc).

It's ""one"" anchor position... why four anchors?   

When one has to try SO hard to be politically correct, as is the case with these CBC choices, then one really begins to question the authenticity behind it."
"So the author of the study clearly states that institutional racism exists, then with this preconception asks a sample of black people if they ""feel"" racism exists. When they say yes, it reinforces the author's belief. 
At least see what percentage of other racial groups have been stopped by the police, mistaken for a worker, or felt outraged about their treatment. Give us a comparison. Show the hard numbers. Just ""feeling"" repressed doesn't make it so.

Germany big enough? Remember, it's got contingent of former lazy ol' commies, too. Very successful doing just what Bernie says. 
Helping works, not just for Europeans. And Germany has had a large influx of Turkish/ Portuguese too.
As far as ethics: Americans work FAR longer hours, for less wages, less benefits, less time off. This is true of the working class, especially. Your charge that Americans are less ""disciplined"" than others is bogus.
Remember now, our leadership began during the 50s. We had a large African-American and Latino population then, too. I might remind you that our economy still is the wonder of the world. It is wealth disparity that's the problem: ""wage stagnation"" and a tax system that overly benefits the wealthy and the very wealthy. Thanks to Reaganomics, our investment in education has shrunk.
I think you're the one who'd be happier in another country, a 3rd world one with very low taxes."
"Hank Jr.is very talented,I used to enjoy his music & even went to one of his shows years ago. I didn't realize at that time that he's a right-wing,redneck racist & an obnoxious & hateful human being. I'll be contacting the advertisers who appear during MNF to appeal to them to pull their advertisements & if they refuse I'll ask like-minded people to boycott their products. I'd also prevail upon the players (the majority whom are black) to refuse to be interviewed or do promos for MNF & ABC as well. The folks at Disney (their parent company) should be ashamed of themselves for standing idly by & should demand that not only should Hank Jr. be dropped,but anyone who thought this was a good idea should be fired as well !"
Great news in view of things. Perhaps they can emulate how we do such deals in Texas. That's why our state is always in the black financially speaking.

You've taken the most obvious and easiest to spot difference between the two human beings and attributed  much of her loss to that.
Obviously with all of her advantages, you have no idea how much of her loss was due to good old American 
male (mostly) prejudice against women."
"'black lives matter' is just another group of ""Human"" opportunists who are playing copy cat to the United States..

"Hi Charles,  Due to my back and forth with Douglas Card over the Deday/Dunn renaming  controversy, I have been spending more of my time looking into Oregon's history concerning blacks and the racist laws of the past and to a lesser extent, national issues concerning race.  Sticking to Oregon, do you think the U.S. Supreme Court, in Shelby County v. Holder (2013) ruling has affected black Oregonians ability vote in Oregon?  What in your opinion are laws and policies that can be changed in Oregon to address discrimination and/or racism in Oregon?  If you believe all that democrats offer black citizens is the ability to vote, why not switch to a third party?"
"As for any survey, the challenge is self-selection. Even using a randomized method, participants have to decide to participate. A lengthy, somewhat intrusive (one presumes) interview about health and one's life is dependent on characteristics and qualities of each individual participant. Easy to mount an argument that individuals who have experienced much discrimination would decline the opportunity to share personal information with a research team. The team potentially being viewed as authority and elite. On the other hand, PEW research suggests it is actually higher educated blacks are more likely to report discrimination and perceptions of racism. 

HabFan410 raises a legitimate question experience and perception. Unless the experience is blatant, one must ask whether perception rather than an actual event(s) is being reported. Then again, a high level of perceived discrimination still indicates a problem."

"Can government solve these 'black' problems or do blacks have some responsibility to solve their own problems?

My primary experience with blacks has been in the military.  Black Sergeants, black officers, black troops.  Guess what, in that environment, basically what tries to be a meritocracy, blacks succeed or fail based primarily on their own personal hard work and efforts.   Sometimes there is 'affirmative action' or favoritism by black mentors, but most of ones I saw had too much personal pride to want something that they hadn't actually earned.

The other soldiers, sergeants ad officers are more likely to enforce the standards which apply to everyone to their black peers.  The 'government' sets the standards and the blacks have no more difficulty meeting them than any other group.

If we compare that to civilian society that I can see, it appears that the motivated ones went into the military and the the rest went into the gangs or the prison population."

Again- that the black soldiers went without was not just a product of racism, but was also a product of the same, bad conditions that EVERYone experienced during that time-- if you don't want to read the evidence provided to you, that's fine-- just know that selectively honoring a group you perceive as ""victims"" isn't founded in logic or history.  hakuna matata."
"While there are at it, they should remove any statue of Martin Luther King as he is the original founder and leader of another racist terrorist called the Black Lives Matter. Fair is fair...."
"LOL....Gonegolfin talking about other peoples ""political biases"" is priceless!....LOL.....pot calling the kettle black much......LOL"
Orange is much more diverse than brown or black.  Embrace it.  Trump is America's first orange president.

"First it was Muslims, then it was Mexicans and now it's Canadians."
"Notice  that many of the people commenting either haven't read the book- or refuse to admit that there are problems here.
Atwood had an excellent article in the NYT about the book, in which she stated:

""So many different strands fed into “The Handmaid’s Tale” — group executions, sumptuary laws, book burnings, the Lebensborn program of the SS and the child-stealing of the Argentine generals, the history of slavery, the history of American polygamy . . . the list is long.""
(https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/books/review/margaret-atwood-handmaids-tale-age-of-trump.html?_r=0)

She points out that the religious symbols used are Christian- because the book is set in a future America- however the problem is with any fundamentalist society in which anyone's rights are abused."
"Bud Black, please tell them to quit swinging for the fence every time at bat. Not all guilty but tell them all anyway."
"Trump asked an open question to Black America: Where have you gotten with 50 yeas of Democrat mayors, police chiefs,  judges, teachers, school boards, presidents,  governors,  and media?  By every measure things are worse where Democrats of either colour run the show."
"The latter questions in the article hit home for me.  Why are Western concerns and understandings of equality and spiritual roles pushed aside when they conflict with social and cultural roles among non-Western Catholics -- many of whom go along with ""woman as lesser vessel""?  The same hierarchy so worried that Western European and North American Catholics aren't reproducing enough and Roman Catholicism might become Sino-Afro-Hispanic Catholicism with a focus south of the equator.  When it comes to the issue of women's roles, it appears a mighty convenient excuse."
"It is troublesome to read China will support Kim, it is troublesome to read that many of the drugs being sent to the US are from China. Time to hit them where it hurts: financially. BOYCOTT the Chinese!"
"DB, Exactly. What happened to forgiving? If we take the approach of not allowing officers because of the past we would never get over anything. We should hate Germans still. We would hate Japanese etc......get the point? The police have made great strides and should be applauded rather than punished. I am starting to feel that this is no longer the group we know as Pride but rather a division of Black Lives Matter."
"Many on the left think that dropping the atomic bombs on Japan to end WWII was a racist act that would not even have been considered for Europe. The Japanese internment camps run by the US military are routinely characterized as racist. And there are those who fervently believe that the war in Vietnam was manifest racism. Should all statues and monuments to American soldiers therefore be removed?

Slavery was a universal evil that transcended almost all cultures and nationalities. It is still practiced in parts of Africa and Asia. Is anyone who fought to defend those countries more than several hundred years ago racist?"
Bud Black has a false pulse on the team if he truly believes the Rockies are excited to play right now.  Why now?  That's BS.  This team is anything but excited...they are lost in the wilderness with obviously no leader in Bud Black.  Anyone can see this team is anything but excited.  Bud Black - you don't belong here if you can't tell they aren't excited.  Bud Black - clearly you must think the team can only be excited when they are in the fight of their lives - you must've hated being 20 games above .500.  Comment of team being excited should have you fired now...you do not know your team.
"The 'stay at home pouters' were the remnants of the 11% blacks and 12% Hispanics who did show up to vote.  Hillary got 88% of those that did show.  

Even with Trump's anti-illegal immigrant position, the Hispanics stayed home.  

They couldn't hold their noses tightly enough to go to the polls and vote for Hillary."
"When Boy-Roy can't refute facts (which is pretty much all the time), he resorts to absurd personal attacks and usually gets it wrong.  It took my pointing out that (A) I'm Muslim and (B) everyone in my immediate family except my second-youngest granddaughter is visibly ""black"" before he'd back off from accusing me of voting for Trump (in fact I voted for neither of the two ""mainstream"" candidates because there's no point doing so when neither evil is the 'lesser').  His latest accusation is that I am a climate-change denier (and of course nothing could be further from the truth).  Really, Boy-Roy's posts taken in their entirety amount to little more than online shrieking an flailing."
"""Police ask for eyewitnesses who can describe people involved in incidents of interest. They make up composite sketches based on descriptions. ""

Yep, and I'm pretty sure my description of ""a middle aged brown skinned woman driving a speeding car, 50 feet away"" wouldn't be of much use for a police sketch artist.  Your example fails.

You are making a transparently weak argument.  Perhaps it's time for you to reflect on your real motivations."
"You poor victim. No one but the CIA, the Military Industrial Complex, and drug dealers benefited from the Vietnam war. I don't care about fake news about some ""3% to 52% ratio."" You consider poor folks that make bad choices undeserving. That defines you as a volunteer for Vietnam. I was in the draft and got a lucky #. I sacrificed having equal rights under the law. I could have gone to Canada, a civilized country. The Underground Railroad has always ended in Canada. Instead, I tried to leave the country better than I found it at birth. The election of Obama shows folks like me did make a difference. I was a community organizer as well. I made all those accomplishments while dealing with institutional racial discrimination with all my employers. I have more accomplishments if you want to read them. Who is profiling you?  As an old black man, I still get followed when I go shopping at an unfamiliar store. I'm sorry you wasted your life, based on what you have written so far. Peace"
"Scott Walker - There's nothing wrong with protests - Thomas Jefferson said they were as necessary in the political world as storms are in the physical - but that doesn't mean the ideas espoused by the protesters shouldn't be critiqued. When men who make millions of dollars a year for playing a game complain about the ""privileged"" lifestyles of their mostly middle-class fans, those being protested against have a right to object and even to counter protest. When Colin Kaepernick compared his potential employer to a slave owner, he brought his fate upon himself. He has no business whining about it now.

The objectionable part of protest is when it becomes violent, as it has with ANTIFA, Black Lives Matters and Rev Com. Frankly, when any group resorts to violence to ""prove their point"" that group and its ideals should be considered invalidated because entertaining their ideas only encourages further violence in hope of more compromise."
"Despite the largely military audience immediately standing to show the proper respect for the lowering of the flag, Commander in Briefs Trump did not stand and show respect for the flag or for the military tradition.
He surrounds himself with actual military men, he boasts of 'doing the military so well your head will spin', but through his own actions and inactions, he disrespects the American flag and cherished military tradition while on base acting as Commander of the Armed Forces.
Wait for the outrage.
(…there won't be any, …there isn't a black target to point to here,
...just Trump, and he can murder America in the street and his followers won't care.)"
"Orange is far more diverse than black.  Obviously, millions of Americans honor that while millions more like Ms Alvarado are bigoted against orange people."

"And it also killed 100 million Englishmen.
Samoset is believed to have died around 1653 in what today is Bristol, Maine.
""He was a tall straight man, the hair of his head black, long behind, only short before, none on his face at all; he asked some beer, but we gave him strong water and biscuit, and butter, and cheese, and pudding, and a piece of mallard, all which he liked well, and had been acquainted with such amongst the English.""

"A Democrat movement to Resist the Trump Agenda can bury the Democrats deeper in 2020.
*
What Democrats need to fear most is Trump accomplishing his agenda in the next 4 years. 
*
For one of Trump's agenda was the promise he made to Blacks and Latinos during the election ----  bring Blacks and Latinos into the mainstream economy.
* 
Latinos and Blacks, although long ignored and neglected by Democrats, would begin supporting Trump when Trump begins fulfilling his agenda to help Latinos and Blacks get into the mainstream economy.
*
Democrats who do not recognize this very fact of Trump's agenda, thinking that Latinos and Blacks are their bread and butter, would discover in 2020 that the Latinos who gave Clinton the popularity vote majority by winning over 61% of the vote in California would desert them for Trump in 2020."
"There's been a lot of national news reports that 22 million Americans and at least 35 states have benefited from the Affordable Care Act.  The 35 states that benefited from the ACA embraced Medicaid expansion.  The naysayers that beat the anti-Obama drum are the ones whining to eliminate the ACA, but they really don't know why.  I'm with Murkowski to fix the parts of the ACA that may not be working.  How can any American lose with healthcare that protects pre-existing conditions or keeping one's child on his/her parents insurance until their mid twenties?  It's not about the so-called failure of the ACA, it's more about a black president that out thunk the far right."
"Soldiers and people of all backgrounds and races contributed to this highway: a growing number of readers including myself are curious as to why The Alaska Dispatch has run a grossly disproportionate number of opinion and news articles that would indicate that praise is only due to black soldiers, or at the very least, the lion's share:

"The US has freedom of speech too, but that is a freedom from GOVERNMENT persecution. Private employers can and DO enforce rules that include what players can and cannot say. The NFL rules require players to stand for the anthem and to not talk. The NFL has prevented past political actions such as the Cowboy's attempt to protes the killing of 5 Dallas Cops by a Black Supremacist. The NFL seems to turn the other way to leftist protest though."
"The Globe and Mail is regressing back to a golden age of hysteria. Everybody ha forgotten how   Joe McCarthy and his army of moral crusaders could blacklist  people, ruin their lives, have them arrested,  drag them through kangaroo courts and  have them put in prison  with the simple accusation  they were  COMMUNIST.  Our progressive feminists, politicians and  gender warriors have gone back in time to attain the same absolute power over their selected enemy,  who today is any heterosexual man. ""Rapist"" is just as much a state of absolute tyranny."
"You don't want a statue to a man who abolished the African slave trade, defended slaves in court, freed slaves, and helped write the documents that led to the end of slavery in North America?"
"I can not imagine ANY highly educated person wanting to jump into the ring with ""BLACKFACE""..............."
"That period of time led to significant changes in institutional injustice.    While 'the law' can help change behaviors, it is not the perfect way to change the values of any one individual.   Too many people supported 'the law' while not always building relationships..  Paying tax's or donating money took the place of riding a bus next to a black man.   It beat doing nothing at all, but only moral arrogance would say it solved all problems.

Still the nation is better place for those souls who were motivated by compassion.    Some of the institutions came with serious faults and negetive outcomes, such as the destruction of families that has substituted a father with the hand of goverment, in poor famlies of all colors.    Good intentions with negetive results.    

A positive for PE Trump, he has forced both friends and foes to re-examine old habits and failed conventions."
"Meanwhile,  nothing is said about HRC being a racist. She wore black face to a party, accepted funds for her campaign from the KKK, and was pictured (I just saw the picture) of her hugging on the Grand Wizard of the KKK. Nothing was also said about how HRC was told to accuse Trump of being a racist before her campaign started."
"But according to the CBC, Toronto Star and the Globe & Mail, it is the fascists (the alt right) who are the most serious threat to western democracies.  Forget the Islamic terrorists. Forget the leftist group like the Black Block.  They are nothing to worry about.  The alt right, however, threaten our very existence so these massive riots in Hamburg will quickly be dropped from their news coverage and the hysteria over the alt right will resume."
"I, too, appreciate civil discourse.  I read the articles you provided.  If the last article is correct, I will have to change my opinion on abuse. (The data source is at least partially from peoples perceptions which is suspect.  The data source of the ""stop and frisk"" is probably spot on.  The others seem to deal with shootings.)  The Chicago Tribune article specifically stated ""But it is true that a disproportionate amount of murders and violent crimes are committed by Black Americans"" which means the police are often in more dangerous situations.  I want to make sure I am not misunderstood.  I do NOT think any race is more likely to commit crimes because of their race.  I believe it is a by-product of the socio-economic conditions and any person in those conditions would be more likely to commit a crime.  I believe it is the conditions which need to be addressed more than race which is why I support economic zones, school choice, an expanded earned income credit, etc...."
"Well, that is because this is a sneaky article, pretending to be about caring for poor and African women, when, in fact, it wants to justify taking their rights away.  It is written like the writer is a double agent conservative pro-lifer in disguise."
"You know, the Asian culture. The culture of all those Asians who live in the country of Asia, and speak Asian."
Maybe the dear black people show would be about black men explaining why they don't have any interest in supporting or raising their children. Or why they don't value education.
Yeah....we wouldn't want you to have to listen to any black people that might tell a reality that disrupts your worldview.
"No surprise, black lives matter protesters chant kill police, and black lives matter terrorists kill police."
BLM is a racist organization that promotes violence against police officers and anyone who isn't black and doesn't fall in line with their hate filled agenda.
"You are more disgusting to say that the black men who were shot under such sketchy circumstances were all violent black offenders. Too many of black teens and men ""death by cops"" were in cases they were stopped for no reason, were not armed and some shot in the back."
"IF BLM were as concerned about black on black murder, none of this would be an issue."
"They put him in handcuffs and placed him in the vehicle, just like they have done with every other suspect for years and years, and this idiot thought it would be a good idea to lurch around in the back of a moving vehicle to get an injury.  Some times when you mess with the bull, you get the horns.  He got the horns.  I know, lets try to fry 6 cops who did their jobs (did anyone notice that 3 out of 6 were BLACK?)  BCLATOTTM!!!!  (Black criminal lives are the only thing that matters)"
"Steven, where are the BLM protests on black on black crime?

There are none -- they only protest when police have to take the lives of black criminals.

You're not winning any arguments by simply crying ""racist."""
"Yeah, now you can ""recover"" from ""the likes"" of a
black president and save yourself from the affront of a female in such a leadership position."
"last time with QUAIA (Queers Against Israeli Apartheid) marching in the Parade and playing politics

this time do it right and cut funding
the funding is for gay rights and gay pride politics
and not for politics like Black activism, anti-Israel activism
cut the funding and stop the nonsense already

"Maybe signs - ""No blacks allowed"", ""We dont serve Indians"". Oregon's alt left has ridden a time machine back to the 1940's and adopted that era's philosophy wholesale - socialism and the KKK."
"This article is unbelievable.  This is pure garbage.  Change KKK and Nazi to The new Black Panthers and this article would be trash about Obama. You are so wrong. Because one wants to enforce the present immigration law does not make one a racist.  This article is a perfect example of why he got elected.  People are tired of this arrogant, condescending, liberal elitist attitude.  Keep writing this drivel and  your group of like thinkers will continue to shrink, which by the way would be better for the country. We are fed up with people who think they are better than us and know what is good for us.  We are rebelling and it will continue. We show our maturity and disgust not by rioting in the street, lame protesting or holier that thou written articles.  We vote and convince people of a better path. Your ilk is losing. Democrats have lost at least 1200 elected positions  across the country since 2009.  And this will continue. Keep these attitudes and you guarantee 65 Rep. Sen. in 2112."
"Yeah actually it did make it right. Marxists slipped in and opened the floodgates to hell.

90% of crime is done by blacks and immigrants."
of COURSE that was your clear observation eric.....that's who you are.  All while ignoring your own intolerant hatred that you spew here daily. Just toss out the black president line to call all your enemies racists and anything else is completely excused
"But that's the thing - nothing really changes. Democrat out, Republican in. Garbage in, garbage out. The government will not repair things for you. It will just screw them up in different ways. But hey, as long as you get to stick it to the black guy and it feels good, I guess that's what's important, right? No time to solve big problems when we have petty grudges to pay back."
"""Marble went on to tell the Scouts that she’s from a multi-ethnic background that includes “black, Mexican…Jew…Native American” and the “lousy Irish!” People in the audience chuckled.""

Don't know which is worse - ""Jew"" and ""Dirty Irish"" - or the fact that some people ""chuckled"".
This woman has clearly lost her Marbles."
"It's ""Boipatong"" and ""apologize."" But be that as it may, another fine piece of manufactured leftard outrage. But I do have a solution for you: given that you are practically insanely outraged over apartheid (also just 1 p), why don't you sell all your assets and hand over the proceeds to black people, to show us how really, truly,  f...king sorry you are (wth apologies to Monty Python?) This includes, of course, the PC on which you so regularly spew your brain-dead bilge. That way, not only will some apartheid victims benefit, but we will all also be spared from having to read your nonsensical whingeing."
"You are paranoid, Media focuses on his blackness (race) articles from National Post focus on Jewish donors not happy with Obama regarding UN resolution on Israel.
Jewish donors very angry in the Chicago area. Therefore complain about media giving attention to his racial make up and also take it up with NP and Chicago donors complaining."
"The photo is strange.

Why is it that the activist groups such as ""Brampton against Fascism"" and ""Hamilton against Fascism""...

... cover their faces with bandanas and cover their heads with hoodies, and, in photos, often give their opponents the finger, flashing angry eyes?

I mean, is that front supposed to endear people to their side?

And why are labour unions like CUPE proudly displaying their photos on webpages?

Seriously, what is with the hide-your-face bandanas by activists who claim to represent fairness and goodness? When black folks marched in the southern USA in the 1960s, they did not hide their faces. When women in Canada marched demanding the vote a century ago, they did not hide their faces.

What is with the bandanas?"
"George, why ""black"" athletes kneel? did you not read the article where they state out of 680 police shootings that only 161 were black? that means out of the ""reported"" shootings only about 24% are black, the other 76% are not. the kneeling is flat out a political statement being exploited by those players by using their professional positions in the NFL as a means to attain their political goals. in my opinion, its completely unethical and likely a breach of their contracts to do that and they all need to be held in breach of contract and run off."
"As a child I can remember looking at the flag, knowing I belong. There was a pride and a fellowship but back then that was all it was. A symbol of unity. I thought it was a beautiful flag but as young as I was I could never understand that blue blot on it.  A remark to the people who almost exterminated my people. Who killed woman and children in the worst of ways. I can still remember the stories of the camps and the finely ground glass in the food given to my people that served as a warning to me and my kin. You don't trust the English. Guess one could argue that the Brits started it all. Never was I taught anything about a black man. Guess it would be fair for a black man to hate the old flag about as much as I don't like that blue flag. Then again I see the new flag and it means about the same as the old flag would mean to a black south African except now there is no more glass a but two-step, knives and bullets with a coating of economic sidling and reverse discrimination."
The Dunlap temporary pardon was due to Hick's personal feelings rather than political calculus.  The 'D' after Hick's name is his ticket to 80% plus minority or black vote.
"Correct: the failings of the black community are not the same as what has happened in the US. While an understanding of history seems weak these days, Canada was not a slave-owning economy and the vast majority of black people arrived in Caanda as migrants and free people in the 60s, 70s, and 80s. Any failing since then that is discordant with similar migrant cohort experiences, is, I am afraid, there's to bear. The horrific crime and violence rate of the black community needs deep probing for its causes."
The proof to me is that black people have to constantly drive exactly at the speed limit to avoid giving police an excuse to stop them.
"Collin, maybe its simply the fact that this is being made into a racial thing. do you honestly believe that its only blacks that are mistreated by the police? it isn't, and the fact they have turned this into a racial thing is why they don't have the support of many people."
"Marelise, your article today seems more controversial. What I do not understand is how a certain section of our population believes that certain spaces belong exclusively to them. A black woman gets abused on Sewende Laan. Tumi seems to have problems at Jakaranda Radio. Several (more than 30 years) yeas ago I was a young boy listening to Radio Suid Afrika and there was this young kid who called the station to ask why Nelson Mandela not hanged given that he had committed treason. The sae kid might have possibly been Nelson Mandela's admirer before he died. Something tells me that if Tumi sticks long enough, the same group that rejects her now will end up being her ardent supporters."
"It would be great if we all could ""ignore"" race as a criteiron for discrimination.  Of course that is not the case.,  Racism is ""alive and well"" in America today.  Since the election of President Obama we've seen millions of internet posts attacking him with racist comments.  On a wider basis, the use of ""code"" words and references is widespread.  Additionally, it would be disingenuous to claim the far too frequent kilings of black men by police has absolutely no racial component.  

Racial identity and ethnic membership are real and we don't need to ""ignore"" them like they don't exist.  We do need to quit using them as the basis for discriminatory actions."
"Not sure why Black went to Holland with Estevez pumping some serious gas. If he can develop a secondary pitch to complement the fastball and keep hitters off balance instead of just sitting fastball, he's closer material."
"Ms Manigault came across as a very brave, intelligent and poised spokeswoman for the Trump administration.  She displayed these qualities in an obviously hostile and biased arena.  

When confronted by a black male plainly saddled with intimidation, bullying and domination issues, Manigault simply was brilliant!"
"It may be that people from these groups (poor, black, Latino, elderly) do not have the same life experience that you do where they fly often or have checks to cash and have to do it in establishments where they are not well known (i.e neighborhood store) or hang out in bars where they are not immediately known by name.
Having to show a photo id for any normal daily activity would be a new requirement and they were never at risk before of having their identity challenged because their name changed when they married or were adopted.
The failure to accommodate all of these and other circumstances in people's lives that are not like yours is the design of the voter suppression that discriminates against poor, black, Latino and elderly voters."
"I could not agree with you more.  Admiral Aucoin had a stellar career in the Navy, but he did not get his feet wet because almost all of his time was spent in the air.  However, such appointments were not unusual during the past few years.  Some notable examples:  A NURSE was appointed Commander of the US Army Medical Command and Surgeon General of the Army in Dec 2011; She was replaced by another NURSE in December 2015.  There were plenty of qualified SURGEONS, but they were MEN.  In May 2016, an admiral with limited sea experience was appointed Commander of the 6th Fleet.  The sea experience was mostly in amphibious landing ships, but the appointee did spend a lot of time around the top brass at the Pentagon.  Oh, I forgot to say the appointee was female and black. Also in May 2016, a non-aviator was appointed Commander of the US Northern Command and NORAD.  Social experiments?  Political correctness?"
"You really need to learn the history of those statues, the bulk of them went up in 2 main periods, the first being the Jim Crow period in the early 1900s, the second during the rise of the civil rights movement.  In both cases, those monuments went up specifically to remind black people of their place."
Kinda makes sense. The chap Trump has chosen to be Attorney General doesn't believe in justice (at least for blacks and women) and  the lady chosen to look after education is set to trash the public education system in the US. Choosing someone who wants to make health care less accessible for millions of Americans fits the pattern of earlier appointments.
"How many registered Democratic black voters did not show up to vote for Clinton in 2016?  Enough to get her defeated.  This is what happens when democracy is taken for grant or treated indifferently.  Time for introspection on that point.  That being said, never before has the position of North American black people been stronger and organized.  A voice that is not going to go away.  The confederate flag no longer flies over the South Carolina legislature."
"As to turnout and percentage of blacks, this election they favored Trump considerably more than they did for Romney or McCain. That, combined with the exact same dynamic among Latinos, and the unexpected turnout of rural voters, is going to be the fly in your ointment for 4/8 years. This was not Trump's election to win; this was Hillary's election to lose. All she had to do was spend just a tad bit more time among the people she deplores, and we're not having this conversation."
"Hillary Clinton famously called Black youths ""Super Predators"" during a 1996 speech, which she apologized for after being called out during the campaign. Democrats are all in for Planned Parenthood, an organization that was revealed to be selling dead baby parts to the highest bidder. And finally, Hillary Clinton again once said of the Blacks ""Bring them to heel"". If these are part of ""family values"" that you share, then more power to you, Ma'am."
u kno NFL is not the place to be talking about oppression of black people right??? NFL has more millionaire and 6 figure Afro-Americans than ANY OTHER industry in USA... Now if you were the only Afro-American in the NHL sitting down during the anthem the message would much more somber and serious... NFL is no place to pretend to be an everyday Joe because you're not. If you're in the NFL then you are a gifted and talented athlete whose future has a million more opportunities than the rest of us. And your going to accuse us of oppression? Almost as sad as last seasons performance KAPE!
"Do these players even know what it is they are protesting?  Capernick started a protest about the disproportionate number of blacks incarcerated in American prisons.  Maybe he doesn't realize that the number of people (regardless of race) in prison is based upon the number of people convicted of crimes.  Wouldn't it be a better effort to try to make it so less crimes are committed?  Protesting a sad fact seems awful hollow, it is like protesting that there is too much rain in Washington.  Even worse, protesting that certain people should not go to jail would seem to encourage those people in their criminal pursuits because famous athletes ""feel"" for them."
"So Hillary's appeal is to Democrats who make over $200,000 and old hippie men and women.  The young, the idealistic, those who make less money, those who think a Presidential candidate should be honest instead of electable, the Independents; Bernie gets them.   Let's see how the blacks and Hispanics go.  If she can't carry them in South Carolina and Nevada, she needs to concentrate on the Clinton Foundation."
No it will end when people stop being so racist.   Black lives matter arose because black youth were being killed.  Question for you is why do you defend racism?
We need to keep the black privilege conversation going if we hope to arrive at an amicable closure.  Please join in.
"Another example of the LaLa land atmosphere in Universities. I am not aware if there is systemic discrimination against Black students at Massey or UofT requiring the ""fulsome transformation"" the petition requires. Not sure if Marrus had any history of picking on Black students. If neither assumption applies (which I trust is the case),  the Dean should have reprimanded Marrus in a meeting with him and the student involved,  and then told the campus that Marrus had apologized and that his long history of distinguished service unblemished by any suggestion of racism justifies the institutions' acceptance of Marrus' explanation of making a joke (tasteless and offensive as it was). End of story. It's not a story about political correctness; its another story of spineless administrators failing to stand up to a bullying group of students."
"So when the church owned black slaved not 200 years ago in the U.S. we should have been radically Christian in your opinion and just told those black slaves to shut up and realize they are just playing the victim.  

Great job.

I think you do not know what Christian means and actually need to read the Gospels which provoke all believers to stand up against hypocritical teachings of religious leaders.  Do what is right and treat all the same because there is no authentic unity without authentic justice for all.  

That is why Jesus tells us that above all else Love God and then love your neighbor no matter who he or she is and never treat others differently than you wish to be treated yourself."
"And Black Voters, Hispanic Voters, LBGT Voters... The list goes on! There's a reason NYTs profits are down 95%!"
Huh?  What does his background or wealth have to do with him taking a stand against unarmed black men being murdered around the country?  He is famous and owes his support to these people.
"Help us out here, ""D.B.""  What was it that got you fired?  Did you not believe that black people should be able to eat where you were bussing tables? Were you a city clerk who refused to issue a marriage license to gay people? It's interesting too that you use a nom de plume assumed by a 1971 airplane hijacker who boarded with what was thought to be a powerful bomb. ""Takes all kinds,"" doesn't it?"

"Police have an extremely well documented and historically verified pattern of abuse and bigotry towards blacks, gays and women.  The massive class action lawsuit against the RCMP being just one ongoing example to this day.

Although this move by pride Toronto is understandable, it's not inclusive.  But until police can reinvent themselves as trusted partners and not oppressors, they will continue to be shunned in public participation events."
"Ok. This is why I said ""Wow!"" When you refer to ""them"" - are you talking about black people? Hispanic people? both? What problems in ""there"" communities are you talking about? Are you talking about street crime? Or housing and other forms of systemic discrimination that is largely out of the hands of the victims? Are you suggesting that Black and Hispanic people ""live and work for"" those problems or are to blame for those because we're not ""self-reliant and personally responsible?"" Are you suggesting that we don't want cops in ""our"" neighborhoods to protect us against street crime? I don't even know where to begin..."
"With respect Ms Dlomo, the sudden appointment of a black woman as CEO, after months of silence on their awareness of the fraud, shows their absolute disrespect for ordinary south africans. Oakbay made a representation that R30 million spend on a Sun City wedding was a legitemate business expence. That was a fraudulent misrepresentation. Who in Oakbay made this presentation as it is criminal offence and he/she should have been before the court already. Who in KPMG signed of that these wedding expenses as legitimate business expenses, openly fraudulently? No need for an external investigation to prepare the case. There are more angles to this toffee. KPMG to continue business must save clients and the main object is too demonstrate to these clients that whilst KPMG will take some steps, the important factor is that KPMG will continue to cover client secrets. Also KPMG is making a power show of their flop. Returning R23million fees is nonsense. It was never earned. R40 million is nothing."

"I'm all for conversations and thinking things through.
I'm not exactly clear about how Lee is part of New Orleans history, other than being a general of the confederacy.  How does a statue of a Confederate general make a southern city culturally distinct?  
I find it curious that there are so many statues to Confederate generals, hero-worshiping men who led what was a war of rebellion against the US.  IN most countries, those men would be seen as traitors.  Yet, in the South, they are heroes.  Since this was was about the right to continue enslaving Black people, this fact says much about the South -- and nothing very good."
"It amazes me that some posters who have, in the past, supported officers shooting young black me who have no weapon and are running away from them now attack the State Police for shooting Finicum who was armed, refused their orders to get down on the ground and reached toward his pistol.

"Has the pope spoken authoritatively on the Standing Rock Sioux and Cheyenne River tribes?

How am I a racist for saying that Sharpton is a shakedown artist?  You can't count the number of black people who have classified Sharpton as a shakedown artist.   And declaring him a shakedown artist isn't a racist act, either.  

So here's the todo list:

1. Show formal teaching from Pope Francis on this topic.
2. Substantiate that black people who classify Sharpton as a shakedown artist, aren't racist when they do, but I am."
"curious how you claim republicans have done nothing, to then reference Jack Kemp destroying your own argument. Kemp-Dole were the GOP leadership for eons. One gave us affordable housing, the other gave us the ADA.
 Here's the problem with your statement. We have spent trillions of dollars on poverty problems, hundreds of billions of dollars in the Chicago area alone...and it has done absolutely nothing to address poverty. Furthermore, we have refuge after refuge that came to our shores, worked their butts off, and went into business. remember the LA riots when the blacks terrorized the Korean businesses?
 It's one excuse after another. Rather than point the finger at dysfunctional republicans ask yourself this question; why is it after black sports players have spent billions of dollars on charity programs they started has the problem of poverty remained the same over the decades? Carson, who escaped poverty, says the same thing my Chickasaw mother taught me. They call him Uncle Tom"
"Really? 

Seriously?

Inequalities in education and employment? When blacks are literally given preference in both through the law. The very definition of systemic racism. Having your application denied because of the color of your skin isn't a problem for blacks in America today, it's a problem for non-blacks.

And the police? The media lies about that too. Remember ""hands up don't shoot?"" The lie spread by CNN, Denver Post, WaPo, etc. That never happened. The ""black community"" time after time rallies around the most despicable people that were in the WRONG. 

I don't need to talk to someone to find out they're wrong. I see plenty of evidence of that every day without subjecting myself to hearing it in person."
"Russian operatives set up an array of misleading Web sites and social media pages to identify American voters susceptible to propaganda, then used a powerful Facebook tool to repeatedly send them messages designed to influence their political behavior.

The Web sites and Facebook pages displayed ads or other messages focused on such hot-button issues as illegal immigration, African American political activism and the rising prominence of Muslims in the United States. The Russian operatives then used a Facebook “retargeting” tool, called Custom Audiences, to send specific ads and messages to voters who had visited those sites.

We could just as easily be describing an effort by the NRA or the RNC.

 Except that it was a foreign government intent on undermining American interests.

Even if your put aside questions of collusion, (…and there was), 

 ...the fact remains that Moscow (correctly) judged that supporting Trump’s candidacy would weaken the United States at home and abroad."
"The simple reason gun sales increase with Obama is the very reason for the Second Amendment. Citizen protecting themselves from a tyrannical government. Was this true, didn't matter, this is how they felt. This with many on the left doesn't compute. The NFL player are protesting police violence toward blacks, this isn't true that the police are targeting black, but that's what the players have been told. Aren't the police authority, and would the police be among the first if, as many on the left believe Trump wants his way or the highway. And what protects those of you who do not want to comply? So citizen give up there guns, and only the authority and the criminals have guns, then what."
"He was terribly unqualified. He majored in political science, for pity's sake. A bit of a loon as well:

""enslaving"" minorities, called black leaders ""race traders,"" and labeled former President Barack Obama a ""Maoist"" with ""communist"" roots.""

And

 ""He was brought up by socialists to be a socialist. His associations were socialists or worse, criminal dissidents who were bent on overthrowing the government of the United States. He has no experience at anything other than race baiting and race trading as a community organizer.""

Usually, you have to to Alex Jones to get this level of reality disconnect. Not the person to be the chief scientist by any stretch of the imagination."
"That man is a Lone Wolf Domestic Terrorist in my opinion and should be prosecuted to the highest degree. But he is no different, no less deadly in intent or actual achievement, than the other lone wolf terrorist attacks we have had here.

To say the driver represents all peace loving conservatives, is  the exact same as saying the Black Lives Matter (BLM) shooter/murderer in Dallas represents all living black people. He doesn't."
"""the racist Civil War general Robert E. Lee"" is a historically inaccurate portrayal.  Robert E. Lee was actually from the south but not for slavery but believed in the rights of States. He was widely respected by both sides for his treatment of prisoners and African Americans. 
  
If you look back and judge people by today's standards then even Abraham Lincoln who wrote before he won the Presidency that African Americans were inferior would be considered racists.  

No doubt a tough issue. Racism is a curse.  But how we treat and judge historical figures has to be tempered with and placed in context within the values of the day and whether they help progress the world to the values we agree on in today's world."
">>He believed that no Canadian should be discriminated against because of his or her:.. ..religion,


That is not the discussion here, you are shifting the topic.

Objections are very specific:

Ditch the Islamophobia ( as it implies Canadian s are Islamophobes).
Freedom to criticize, question ANY religion.

Hate crimes against Blacks and Jews are the predominant one.

This whole political game has been in the making since the Liberals came to power, with Muslim activists quietly advancing their agenda."
"Black American athletes have threatened in the past to boycott the Olympics to make a point about racial injustice. Such a thing would cripple the U.S. team. However, there is now so much money at stake for successful athletes, it seems unlikely that such a sacrifice would come about. But professional athletes taking a risk of 'rocking the boat' to make a point is a relatively new concept."
Reading this hit piece by MSW you'd think the Pres. Obama's only unqualified successes were that 1) he is black and 2) he has a nice family.
"Thank you. That is very well said.  When I read these letters about the Obama year's that are so full of disdain, and so missing of real data and content, it is clear that his real problem was being a black man that won the Presidency not once, but twice. When asked to tell me what specific thing has changed for them for the worse in the last 8 years, the silence is pretty deafening."
"Wayne was an honor student. He credits a strong academic work ethic for his success.  His word play is genius. He's also a skateboarder and black, soooo he gets his hate..."
"CONTINUED from ABOVE:

I refer of course to the American Eugenics Movement, which inspired Hitler and which argued that certain ""lineages"" should be forcibly sterilized or otherwise eliminated, to ""improve"" humans by culling ""inferiors"".  Who decides what's inferior?  That has literally proved to be a life or death question.

Regarding your last question as to my ""deciding"" to be heterosexual, that isn't the RIGHT question if you would understand the logical fallacy of claiming certain behaviors ""inborn"" without evidence.  It is as inaccurate a comparison as trying to equate ""gay"" and ""interracial"" marriages in this context.

I'll use myself as an example why the comparison can't be used to claim choice-of-mate is ""inborn"", i.e. controlled by genetics.  I'm mixed European and Arab.  I've had three wives.  Two are black.  One is half-Thai and half Texan.  So am I ""genetically wired"" to marry black women?  Or Thai women?  Or (God forbid) Texas women?  What's your answer?  I'll wait."
"Pearson was  a racist forbidding the relocation of Black American soldiers on Canadian soil during the Cold War for fear it would upset the local  populations (in this case Quebecois who were apparently  also so racist that they wouldn't tolerate having black people living among them ) Yep its true

"Burning the country down?   The Pennsylvania and West Virginia coal miners who are returning to work would disagree.   So would the thousands of new hires on the approved Keystone Pipeline.  And lets not ignore the offshore drilling permits which were not renewed by Obama but have been under President Trump. And the UAW seems to be pleased with Trump's stand on renegotiating NAFTA.   And as for the bogus Paris Accord on Climate Change, Trump just saved this country billions of extortion monies to the United Nations........

  The only burning I see is being perpetrated by left wing rioters backed by the Marxist Commnists.   You know them, Antifa, the BLM, The New Black Panthers, CPUSA, the World Workers Party.......All radical, violent left wing communists who have yet to be denounced by your Democrat party.............Communism is growing in this country and it's you and your fellow Democrats who are allowing it to happen.........Orwell's ""Animal Farm"" is here."
"In his Dallas speech, Obama referred to himself 45 times.  He told black leaders ""your only hope is me"".

"Thank you for your reflection, Sister Joan.  As an Afro-American Catholic Christian woman, I was astounded and saddened to read on NCR's website that 32% of Catholics support Trump.  Support for his ignorance, racism, misogyny, and xenophobia indicates a disconnect from Catholic social teaching.  What is clear is that our country will thrive with a qualified female president, and begin to take care of our climate and planet, and remove the structural economic inequalites wrought not by free trade, but corporate tax avoidance and tax breaks for those with high earned and unearned income.  The culture has moved beyond what Trump (and the US bishops) represents.  I am hopeful, even though I never thought the voting rights battles of the 60s would have to be refought.  Peace and all good."
"You're saying that Trump doesn't lie? What?! We both reside on the same planet, so your reaction can't be explained by astronomical separation.

I can understand why you might dismiss Australian success with gun laws, but why cast its mention as a lie? You expressed an opinion; Sid expressed an opinion. If an opinion is a lie then it's just as likely that you must be lying, too. It would be better to explain your thinking. Australia's results are so extraordinary that I think it takes extraordinary logic to argue that such steps would have no effect in the U.S.

Sid's description of Trump's actions and words regarding Puerto Rico are also interpretations derived from facts, not fantasy. I can understand why you wouldn't agree with how he's stating them, but those things actually happened. Just take one - what was your reaction to Trump tossing paper towel rolls?"
"I suppose you have never been to a service in a Black Baptist church. People talk -- indeed, shout -- all the time. It's an integral part of the service, and I wish more Catholics could be like that."

"The issue of which names should be kept, which statues should be destroyed is complex. I have tried to find someone who is above reproach and acceptable to everybody and have failed to find one. Mother Teresa - unacceptable to atheists; Mohandas Gandhi - considered black Africans to be inferior; Queen Victoria - symbol of colonialism and empire; Pierre Trudeau - unacceptable to Conservatives; Tommy Douglas - unacceptable to conservatives; Albert Einstein - unacceptable to Palestinians."

"No.
It's inspiring and exemplary that these millionaires, who could milk a photo-op with Drumpf for their own gain, instead choose to support their black brothers and sisters who are being slaughtered on the streets by U.S. police officers  -- with no outrage expressed by POTUS."
"It's understandable that one relate one's life to segments of age, or development- from childhood-adolescence-etc. This is a fruitful reflection. What you describe in implicit terms, is a life that is also measured by your experience along the way and how it affects you; how you related/relate whether to change, intransigence, or a combination of both. I heard part of an interview with Trevor Noah on growing-up in South Africa.  That was the closest I have come to just listening to ""being black"" and not tinged with resistance to one's treatment. 
I write this with respect - you sound so much like people I know, or would like to know yet with the acknowledged difference - within and without - of being of colour.
The ""difference"" though is only hinted at. Maybe you could shed light - being black, catholic, (apparently) of the cafeteria, in a Church you obviously love, an institution that finds excuses for not loving you as a peer because of being ""woman"". How ""black"" frames this. Thanks."
"No the NRA wouldn't say that. But it is obvious to me that any hoodlum brazen enough to shoot someone down, in the street, like a rabid dog, would have a gun anyway. Gun control won't help the mini race war between pacific islanders and african americans."
"The ADN follow up to our 9/29/96 story, called 'Pepper Spray?, Bad Bet' (10/96) included wildlife biologists explaining bear spray does not work on black bears ""due to a unique protective mucous coating"". Black bears attack and kill most frequently in British Columbia. The reintroduction of grizzlies into the Cascades, presently under consideration, makes the issue one of public safety in Washington now, yet the Seattle Times and Bellingham Herald will not publish my letters warning bear spray should not be one's sole defense. Instead, years ago the Seattle Times sabotaged my efforts by rejecting my letter while *using* me as a source to be made to look foolish in an article and then ridiculed in a letter published in the Times. All of which has continued to show up online as a means of maligning my position."
"No, it isn't. ""Rogers et al. (1991) recorded the responses of 26 free-ranging black bears (Ursus americanus) to used tampons from 26 women and the responses of 20 free ranging black bears to four menstruating women at different days of their flow. Menstrual odors were essentially ignored by black bears of all sex and age classes. In an extensive review of black bear attacks across North America, no instances of black bears attacking or being attracted to menstruating women was found (Cramond 1981, Herrero 1985, Rogers et al. 1991)."""
"Just another tax grab , disguised as eliminating the black market."
"Cleverly worded phrases such as: ""Community Unity Rally set for Saturday in Kent in response to Sikh shooting"" actually states the opposite to its claim of unifying the city, and in truth creates a political divide within our culture. What other purpose would their be to even mention the word Sikh? As though if I were NOT an immigrant, or NOT of African decent, or NOT part of an LGBT organization, that violent crime would somehow hold less value within a community?

We are also currently witnessing one of the largest National Debates on immigration reform in recent US history; as well as the progressive left demonizing anybody for daring to speak out against illegal immigration in the first place. I view this rally as simply another attempt to support the false narrative that borders are unique to the modern world , or that believing in sovereignty for ones country is really aligning ones self with Nazism."

"We as a country can't agree on how best to protect the country. How can we expect to agree on anything else. And those on the left wonder why gun sales have rose the past eight years. It's human nature to look out for one self and family first. 

The four things Mr. Bartee mentioned that represent Trump and his supporters, actually represent Mr Bartee's party. Who has told us life in America today is the new norm? Who has put the black community in the inter-cities, surround by gangs? Who looks at Trump as a bigger threat to the country, then radical Islamic terrorist? Who had an inappropriate relationship, by their own admission, in the oval office? When pointing a figure three are always pointing back."
"This is an issue some men refuse to understand or even acknowledge. While it's true we objectify men to some degree as well (who wants to see a beer gut?), it rarely stands in the way of their success. One expects a leading lady to be beautiful, but directors aren't so discriminating about their leading men. It's why we get old men like Harrison Ford paired with lovely young things like Anne Heche (""Six Days, Seven Nights"").
And that's just Hollywood. It's prevalent in other arenas as well. Compare the Dixie Chicks to Garth Brooks, or Shania Twain to Lyle Lovett. You see it in politics all the time -- remember ""Cankles""?
Usually though, it's much more subtle. There are far more homely men in positions of power than homely women. But hey, women are just being difficult and unrealistic when they bring this up, aren't they? They need to get over themselves, like black people and the ""discrimination"" they think they face. It's all fake."
"The slaves attained high positions in the Ottoman Empire, including several Prime Ministers of the Sultan.

How many black slaves achieved high positions in the European Empires? or in the USA and Canada? When was segregation legal till in European controlled countries like the USA (till 1965), South Africa (till 1994), Namibia (till 1990), Hong Kong (till 1994), etc. Whereas in the Ottoman realms - modern Turkey, there was no segregation against former slaves.

I think there is a false narrative - everyone was equally bad - that is used as a defense for any European crime. I guess everyone in the world was as bad as the Nazis at some point? It would have made a great defense at Nuremberg."
"So, instead of it being purely demographics of preference and opportunity it's because we're all racist here in Portland? I could see that argument being valid if blacks moving here were getting chased out or killed off by Klansman.

I've been bullied most of my life, so I've cultivated a hatred toward any sort of culture that embraces macho posturing, opportunism and predation, and violence including its lesser forms (e.g. coercion, peer pressure etc.). I'm all about people getting along or leaving each other alone, respecting boundaries and belongings, and agreeing to disagree. What I've personally experienced and seen is a mainstream popular black culture that has embraced those things listed above that I — and all decent people — despise.

Charles Mingus isn't being “sung” on the MAX and Frederick Douglass's name isn't on any fashion labels sold in the malls. My antipathy is cultural and applies specifically to those whom it applies to."
"All I'm seeing is how easily '20' becomes '80' with a tiny bit of black paint.
The bicyclistas try to couch their radical anti-auto agenda in 'safety' and some in city government do the same (Hales wanting to ban drive-thrus).

You know who else employs this tactic?  Radical pro-lifers.  Requiring a vaginal probing to get an abortion is all about protecting women's safety......"
"But she is the original corruption queen of South Africa with Sarafina.   Not to mention the recent claims as well as being the SOLE reason she's being pushed is so that the likes of Zuma (JG) and Duarte never see the inside of a court room, let alone a jail cell.   There's not a SINGLE other reason to push this blatantly useless cadre deployee than to keep the trough eating corrupt fed.

There are much better candidates, who not are only women but also black.  Except they are not as corrupt as NDZ, and they dont have the corrupt likes of Duarte and the other ANC swill behind them to push them.   It's disgusting that the most useless AU chair ever thinks she can run a country and promise populist rubbish to do so with the stench of non-stop corruption around her."

"Al Hajji , people can change . America in our lifetimes has changed . Jeff Sessions has changed.  Blacks he worked with claim his heart is a good one , and cite what he has done. He deserves a chance . In this day and age nearly all denounce the KKK .  They hold no sway in America , and that is a good thing.  However , if you feel the hate the KKK represents is written in stone--then never forget most of it's members of the past were democrats .  Speaking of race relations , we have come so very far just in our lifetimes. Obama could have taken us all the way there , but instead chose to divide us by the color of our skin and how much money we have. In every case of national note he has sided based on color. Instead of calling for calm he fanned the flames of racism. That has hurt race relations . If Trump does as he said he'd do by bringing back jobs and helping in the inner city , he may take us all the way towards us becoming one people--American's. That would be a dream fulfilled ."

"1) I am not a ""Yank.""  I am a citizen of the US, and a human being.

2) So what?  Killing Jews was legal in Germany in 1944.  Oppressing votes was legal in the 1950s south.  Discriminating against people of color, and making them use separate restrooms was legal then, too.  Doesn't make it moral or right.  Your attempt to belittle another human's understanding of this by using dog whistle words like ""politically-correct"" is disgusting and reprehensible.

3) Wrong.

4) Wrong.

5) Irrelevant what other ""goals"" the North had.  The main reason for this war was the fact that the secessionist did not want to give up their slaves, and were willing to dismantle a country over it,

6) The ""main issue of the war"" to Lincoln was the preservation of a nation.  The secessionists' insistence on keeping slavery, and their willingness to dissolve the union was the catalyst that caused him to have to act.

7) Agreed that the murder of Lincoln was tragic.  The rest of your diatribe was nonsense."

"Racism has become synonymous with viewing or treating people badly because of their race.  But racism does not require poor treatment; it can also be manifested in good treatment of others because of their race.  And like all propaganda, the Left would disagree and deny that good treatment could ever be considered racists, and how dare I suggest that treating someone good could be considered a bad thing.

Probably the most racist thing that ever occurred in this country since the Civil War was the election of one of the least qualified candidates for President who ever ran on the basis of his race.  I was one who voted for him, for his rhetoric of uniting the country and because he was Black and thus uniquely qualified to unite.

You want to end racism?  Get the government out of race talk.  Stop talking about treating people differently- better or worse - because of their race.  When you give to one, you take away from others.  The road to Hell is paved...."

When Trump -- from a safe distance -- said Rev. Faith Green Timmons was a ""nervous mess,"" he gave us a good idea of what blacks would lose with Trump as president: Respect.

"The sad / funny part is that August Cisar's letter flew right over the heads of 90 percent of democrats----perhaps 95 percent .  Today's democrats have long mistakenly thought of themselves as the fighters of justice for black America from the beginning . They have no idea---none--that their party fought to keep slavery .  Fast forward to today :  Trump said it best on how every four years the democrats tell blacks they have their backs---then disappear until the next election.  Trump repeatedly mentioned how he planned to fix the inner cities---the greatest death trap for minorities. Under Obama black unemployment rose and thousands died in the inner cities across America . If Trump keeps his promise to work on fixing the inner cities , republicans will start getting the black vote they have long deserved ."

George, sometimes the truth hurts....Obama was the first black president...big deal.

What Humpety Trump said in his speech hurt those of Obama and even Mr Bush and Slick Willie but the facts are exactly that.  Our country is in a mess, and it needs to get cleaned up top to bottom and from side to side.  While it didn't measure up to your expectations, Mr. Will, it hit home for those who don't live in tinsel town and for Joe Lunchbucket, it gives hope that campaign rhetoric wasn't that with Trump...he means it.  

Now the proof will be in the pudding but Mr. Trumps speech hit the nail on the head for those who voted for change and the way you liberals spoon out the sauce and expect the rest of America to believe."
"The not-guilty verdict, returned after an initial deadlocked jury and after more than 25 hours of deliberation, proves that even a liberal enclave like the one Castile worked in and lived in, that having a licensed gun, like the one Castile had, that having a 4-year-old girl in the back of the vehicle he was operating, cannot bring worth to a black man’s life in the eyes of a cruelly racist justice system."
"Well it would be nice to live in the same America as you? Where those gifts belonged to black communities too, where people had the freedom to express themselves and it was a right guaranteed by a constitution. If they weren't black maybe they would feel the same way you do? But since they disrespected ""her"" should they have those rights revoked? If black soldiers die too will that give them the right to protest? I assume you must be black since you seem to understand the America they live in so well."

"I challenge these highly paid black athletics, who are so critical of the United States, to name a country in Africa or elsewhere in the world to which blacks have immigrated where their lives would have been better socially and economically than in the United States of America.

"Oregon justice is a total joke. They are offering the same deal to my daughters rapist dominique elliott thornton  a black male who attacked and raped her on Martin Luther King day 2017. She was only 17. Measure 11 would give him 20 to 30 years. Other states would do the same. What does this say about Oregon? If you want to rape  kids than oregon is the place to be! Absolutely disgusted with this state and the system should be ashamed of themselves. Evidence includes photo, dna and consistant statement. Funny they are giving him the deal before the dna evidence results are in. Not to mention entered into national data base as there may be many more victims."
"Recent polling results show African-American voters for Trump as low as 0%.  In other words, polls with a sample size of one thousand came up with not a single black voter supporting Trump. With good reason!"
"Shame on all the superdelegates who did not represent the actual will of the people. 

Closed to 70% of democratic state parties made deals with the Hillary Victory Fund. The Fund allows Hillary’s multi-millionaire and billionaire supporters to bypass individual campaign donation limits.  It also enables the Clinton campaign to buy 500+ superdelegates with the promise of contributions to their re-election fund.  

Hillary also received millions of additional votes because of the EARLY endorsement from the 500+ superdelegates.  This is because electability has been a major factor among many voters especially black voters.  To date, 22 million people have voted and Bernie Sanders has won 46% of the states; it’s absolutely disgraceful that he has only received less than 5% of these superdelegates.  The race is rigged for sure!"

"No, the reason I keep going on about this is I despise homophobia, and Pandora's pandering to homophobes. And her incessant lying as well.

I cannot abide bigotry. I have stated my reasons: My mother's family are Jews, my younger brother and some of my closest friends are gay, my daughter-in-law is black. All these people have known bigotry, and opposition to it is one of my core principles.I particularly dislike it when that bigotry is ""justified"" by an appeal to religion, which is a perversion of religion."
"I believe President Schill's point is that it is inexcusable for a supposedly educated person to not understand the implications of wearing blackface in modern America. Her intent may not have been harmful, but her qualifications to teach law might just be called into question if she is that culturally ignorant. Such actions do warrant an investigation into whether she is someone who had one, rather large, blindspot or whether she is simply unqualified.

He did say that she could not be fired out of hand and would have her due process rights protected. I for one think President Schill is handling this bucket of slop he has been given as well it could be done. He's the best university leader I have seen in many a decade and he has my full support, not that that means much."
"Actually, there a a LOT of reasons that a business person can legally fail to provide accommodation, but this train of thought has just gone from the sublime to the ridiculous. You may refuse service to a person because you don't like the color of his shirt.  But you cannot refuse service to a Christian, a Muslim, a woman, a black person, people with children, or a gay person solely because of their status.  It really is that simple, and all this hypothesizing is ridiculous.  Oh, the things people can contrive in their little minds."

"I'm trying to string together the thoughts that reproductive choice is a right, and that there should be some sort of externally financed Marshall Plan type of support for Africa, where women often produce 7 or 8 children.

Even Donald Trump rarely manages to sound quite THAT crazy."

Or, why is there a 'special treatment' for Kafirs? Why were non-Muslim taxed exorbitant amounts? Why is/was non-Muslim human deemed dispensable in the Muslim culture?

"When Trump launches into a spittle-flecked tirade against those #BlackLivesMatter radicals who think police should shoot fewer unarmed black men, the racism is so obvious it might as well have been written in the sky by the Blue Angels."
"The fact that Ottawa's Police are not welcome in their uniforms & do not have a float in Ottawa's Pride Parade denigrates 'All Canadian Police Officers' by the rise Social Media's self-ingratiating mob-fanatical bigotry with much like the pig-ignorant racist bigotry that tore apart the many innocents whose lives were translated into being 'homosexual pariah 'in the days of injustice & pig-ignorance.. before the advent of our Western Civilization's open-minded enlightenment & truly educated Humans who finally understood the 'bias'

And now.. Cdns are yanked back by the 'power-game' of a small group of anarchic bigots desperately trying to undo the ""Pride"" our prideful friends & neighbours have graciously evolved to.

"maybeinoregon, I know several of her coworkers.  She is the BAD APPLE and there are a majority  that do not like her because she has chosen to hide behind her ""BLACKFACE"" philosophy.............Lane County should have terminated her many years ago, and they have valid reasons to do so, HOWEVER,  Lane County is running SCARED because of all of the lawsuits.  The jury's here seem to award big sums of money when the word ""racism"", OR  "" profiling"" is mentioned.  

In 1997 she sued Marion County over a racial discrimination issue and was awarded $243,000.00.    In 2003 she  sued Lane County and was awarded $50,000.00.  In 2015 she filed ANOTHER racial lawsuit against Lane County, and THANK GOD, she lost that one.  There is a profile here, and it is that she is using her BLACK skin to sue.  

When she won her previous  lawsuits,  that gave BLACK people, ONE  BLACK eye.  Now with this latest lawsuit, she has given BLACK people, TWO BLACK eyes.  

I PRAY she loses this next lawsuit.

The same with the Baltimore police.   All because of a black lynch mob and a black prosecutor who decided to show boat for them and the media police were brought to trial on charges that should have never been filed. A black judge has found  them all innocent so far.  This lady should be disbarred .  And how about the great black mayor who told the police to stand down and allow blacks to steal and destroy property ?  Police are getting bricks thrown at them and they can't fight back.  Who's side are you on ?  Not those keeping us all safe , that's for sure."
"It seems BLM is still trying to figure out what it is, but I don't see anything in their principles that directly addresses not getting shot in the back by police.   http://blacklivesmatter.com/guiding-principles/    Given that most Black men are shot by other Black men, it seems BLM should be more concerned about their Black men.

"Trump asked about the left wing hate groups like BLM, antifa, Occupy Wall Street - all funded, organized, violent left-wing hate groups.  Democrats have been hiding behind the mob since they lost the civil war.  They organized new ones in recent years - same techniques, same people, new names.

Charlottesville would never have happened if the black vice mayor had not decided to pick a fight by removing a statue.  It would never have happened if democrat VA governor McAulliffe and the mayor had not told law enforcement to stand down.  The entire event is similar to Trump campaign events last year where democrat mayors told local law enforcement to stand aside and allow democrat rent-a-mobs to attack and beat Trump supporters leaving his rallies.  San Jose was one such example.

Senator Begich seems just fine with mob violence, as long as it is his guys doing it.  Be careful what you wish for, Senator.  Cheers -"
"Ahhh - the irony.

There was a post election study of voting patterns between 2008, 2012 and 2016 showed that significant numbers the black community that voted for Obama simply stayed home in 2016. The proponents of Russian collusion would prefer that you did not read the assessment.

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/registered-voters-who-stayed-home-probably-cost-clinton-the-election/

Bill Clinton did say of Obama in 2008: ""A few years ago, this guy would have been getting us coffee.”  

I would wager that if you asked the average black American who was perceived as more racist, Trump or Clinton, the answer would be very close. But only because the media hits Trump much harder."
It sadly shows who is out there blogging when a comment that does not meet civility standards gets more positive votes than a comment that opposes racism against blacks. This leads us to why action needs to be taken to oppose racism and religious bigotry. We cannot let those who would promote racism against blacks and hatred towards Muslims to get away with it. These and anti-semitism are the current focal points of bigotry in our society. The bigots will forever try to argue that we must only talk in generalities because they will never specifically oppose bigotry to the specific groups that they dislike.
"Unfortunately you are the echo chamber of a Marxist media that is so well documented as to negate any need of spending time on.

This was one of the first cases that ever dealt with this issue, and has seen it go to many different courts to verify the decissions made.

I don't want to debate the issue, except to say that these points are at best arguable, and just saying, ""He did a great job"" without further examination because he is Black would be more racist than making the substantive arguments against his policies.  So Trump is de facto racist because he criticizes Obama's policies and has a history of questioning Obama's birthplace (which, of course, remains debatable).  Sad."
You make good points Ms. Moore.   What needs to be pointed out is that free speech does not extend to private employers which the NFL certainly is. Free speech protection extends to individuals and government employees not to someone on the job such as the NFL or any other person in private employment. The NFL could put a stop to the actions of Kaepernick. Of course they won't because he is Muslim and black and any action would not be politically correct.
"What does Obama's color have to do with anything ?  He has reduced our country to it's lowest level since Carter . He did that by himself , with Hillary Clinton's help of course. It had nothing to do with him being black or her being a woman.

They want us to be just a country equal to everyone else---not the force for good over evil in the world."

This collectivist strategy is as old as time and is the foundation for the fall of empires. Every collectivist government that has risen and fallen has used the same playbook. Demonize your opponent, divide the populous, overpower the system. Identify a ""common enemy"" for the society to battle, if you can't find one, invent one . . . maybe ""gun violence"", or ""assault weapons"", or gun law ""loopholes"". Sound familiar?

Mahalo nui for providing this insightful link."
"Without exactly equal and same ordination practices for men and women there will be no fullness of participation.  We truly lie to ourselves and sin the wrong of hatred while we stand by and watch women being treated as lesser human beings in our church.  Christ never taught that women should be treated differently than men for any reason.  We need to honestly call sexism out for the hatred and abuse that it is.  

If I were to imply that black men could gain fullness of participation without same and equal treatment and ordination - I would be called a racist hater of black people.  My accusers would be correct in their judgement and complaint just as women are just in accusing all of us who are willing to be the example of this sexist hatred in our church by not demanding women be ordained priests immediately.

"I thought it was important Danno. I cringed at O'Malley's words reported above. Anybody can see the attempt, in the line of questions I have extracted above; to make an innocent, 14 year old boy, COMPLICIT in his own abuse. The abuser, Brendan Smyth was a  notorious cleric. I think to give him his title would be insulting to victims. He died in an Irish jail and was buried at night by his religious order in a cement grave.

The  copies of the questions and answers; also the procedures; .. are  dated & signed by all three priests present and Brendan himself. His father had to remain outside the room. Three educated priests; one a canonical lawyer; in full clerical black suites;  alone with a 14 year old boy; in a religious institution. That was intimidating.

"When you speak of endangered birds are you referring to the Hawaiian petrel? If so, these rare birds are known to have colonies on Kauai, Lanai, Maui and Hawaii island--NOT here on Oahu--so this argument is moot.   As far as insisting that there should  be preferential treatment for native Hawaiian wildlife by killing off other animals such as free-roaming cats in order to protect them, this argument flies in the face of many Hawaii residents who staunchly believe Native Hawaiians should NOT receive preferential treatment despite the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy by non-natives.  In fact, Native Hawaiians receive disparate treatment in Hawaii's criminal justice system just as African Americans receive disparate treatment in America's criminal justice system, serving longer prison sentences in comparison to other races.  So which is it?  Should we pick and chose which species are worthy of preservation while sending those whom we deem unworthy as sheep to the slaughter?"

Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off in my black helicopter to David Suzuki's private landing strip, where I'll board his taxpayer-funded Learjet and fly with him to a lavish seven-day party on Tahiti with assorted supermodels, rockstars, IPCC scientists, and French-speaking lesbian UN officials, presided over by Al Gore, where -- when we're sober enough to talk -- we will plot how to establish a world socialist government, take away your guns, force better health care on you, and make you memorize long passages from books by Naomi Klein.

Mean while the  reactionary bishops appointed under JPii and Benedict xvi are so desirous of their back door channels and whispering innuendo- they are consolidating control with their reactionary priests, bred in the seminary to be the storm troopers to save the good and faithful Catholics from those radical priests and even the current occupant of the Chair of St Peter.

"HanabaDays, you are in complete denial of reality by saying the alt-left is a fiction of the alt-right.  You apparently have never seen news reports of Black Lives Matters with hundreds of its supporters marching through city streets shouting “What do we want, dead cops; when do we want them, now” …” Pigs in a blanket, fry them like bacon.”   Fiction?  And what about the mobs that show up to protest conservative speakers on college campuses?  I am referring to the left-wingers who wear hoods and masks, smash windows, assault innocent bystanders, loot, burn cars and buildings like they did a few short months ago at UC Berkeley.  Fiction?

"You nailed it: it is a cultural problem. Rather than a culture of aspiration and discipline, the black community has unfortunately become embroiled in a culture of victimhood and gangsterism. It does not value those in their community who are scholars and thinkers, or those who have families and work hard and obey the law. Instead, it worships gangsters, those who abuse and deride women. 

We have heard the same excuses, blaming this country of that country. The raw fact is Canada never had this as a problem just three decades ago. It is an imported problem. Europe never had this as a problem but it now does. More police and gun control laws will not solve it, nor will more social welfare payments. Only a cultural change and a mindset change will stop the violence."

"No one is trying to ""erase history"" by taking down statues of traitors such as Robert E. Lee.  Unless the history lesson is that these statues were put up in the first place.  I think the history lesson should be this: taking down the statue sends a message that our community is not going to support the reinvention of history -- the making of Robert E. Lee into a hero, and an ""in your face"" reminder to African-Americans of the days when their ancestors were slaves."
"How does this happen?

I think it's the outcome of Republican political tactics since Nixon (the Southern Strategy and alliance with the religious right) and the network of direct mail, talk radio & TV (notably Fox), periodicals and internet propaganda outlets that accompanied the rise of movement conservatism and stoked the culture wars. In short, the politics of resentment.

Their efforts have been quite successful, cementing social conservatives to the GOP and producing in a signifiant swath of the electorate the conviction that liberals are intent on robbing real Americans of their hard-earned dollars and giving them away to black people and other undeserving minorities, who then get to attend elite universities like Harvard and Princeton and become president and First Lady of the United States.

At the same time, during a period of wage stagnation, the Democratic Party became less identified with labor and the working class and more oriented toward professional cosmopolitans."
"Re: ""For me, its easy to dislike Trump because he is a Christian""

I see no evidence that he IS Christian. 

He bears constant false witness. He has committed adultery numerous times (and quite publicly). He covets ... a LOT. He mocks Christian sacraments (and the Pope). He rejects Christ's message to ""sell all that you have and give it to the poor"". (  I sincerely doubt he tithes.) He rejects the Christian concept that all are worthy. He mocks the disabled and doesn't seem inclined to help 'heal' any maladies. (Quite the opposite, it seems.) The only way he's ""honoured [his] father] was to emulate his discriminatory business practices by trying to deny rental accommodations to blacks. He rejects Christ's notion that ""the servant is worthy of his hire"" by stiffing his contractors. He in no way ""love[s his] enemies - quite the contrary. (He seeks revenge for every imagined slight.) He is neither charitable nor loving.

There's more. (Sadly.) 

Pious? Maybe; ""Christian""? No way."
"She did have four Black step-siblings.  If she's sincere about identifying with Blacks, and if she's not doing anything illegal or harmful, why not let her be Black?

Of course, most of us haven't seen her up close, so perhaps those who've worked with her and served on the NAACP with her would have a better idea of her level of sincerity.  Or they might be intolerant themselves.  More info, please."
"So why isn't Saudi Arabia on the banned list?  After all, fifteen of the nineteen 9/11 hijackers were from that country.  The rest were from Egypt, UAE, and Lebanon who are also missing from the list.  Why were those countries omitted?  Couldn't have anything to do with places where Trump has business interests could it?

But if you've been paying any attention to the news whatsoever, the ban isn't just being applied to people from those countries.  Muhammad Ali's son was detained for hours and quizzed as to whether or not he was Muslim (this despite being an American citizen born in the US) and just yesterday a Canadian citizen (born in Canada and travelling on a Canadian passport) was refused entry to the US - she was told she needs a visa (her crime appears to be having a brown skin).  The list goes on.

"Within this century much of Canada could more resemble the cesspools of India or the Islamic world, or heaven forbid the basket cases of Africa, than the flawed but brilliant beacons to liberty, culture, economy and technology that represents our inherited legacy. 

Simply look at the liberal screams of outrage at any attempt to ""screen"" for Canadian values.. After all, we must not celebrate the western world's exceptionalism, oh no. We must instead listen to the fictions about how that exceptionalism was built on oppression, instead of the boldness and almost superhuman efforts of our forebears.

Brexit, Trump and perhaps LePen represent the early stages of an awakening of the west.

But yes, it may be too late."
"You ask an interesting question.  May I simply suggest that not all human behavior is rational; in fact, as I look around at what we do to each other and to the earth, sometimes I think we're more likely to behavior in irrational fashion.  ...and, yes, I consider supporting that a man who, all his life, has demonstrated the moral values and emotional instability of Donald Trump, to be irrational. 

After the acquittal of the officers who beat Rodney King, inner city Blacks in LA burned their own neighborhoods and looted and destroyed businesses owned in many cases by other African Americans.  In my opinion, their""blind anger"" fueled irrational behavior.  Our history, as the history of all nations, is ripe with examples of various types of irrational ""mob"" behavior.  

IMO, the support of Donald Trump as a Presidential candidate reflects a widespread disillusion with the ""status quo"" in peoples' lives.  It seems based on the belief that America is ""going to hell in a handbasket""  (con.)"

"LFS2,  great idea about the guided walking tour,  you've interested me in walking the solar system.
I've been involved with a few historic tours of downtown  myself and wish we had more of this.  An  interesting local  fact is that the homesite of the last black person to own property in Eugene , Wiley  Griffon, was right down the hill almost visible from  the Mims' houses.    It was on the corner of 4th and Mill, (EWEB parking)  along the old Millrace.  From the time he died  in 1913, not another African-American was known to  own property in Eugene until the Mims around 1949.

"" What evidence does Nokes present that ....' the tragic legacy of the laws was that they discouraged blacks from coming at all.”   For that, Old Friend,, you'll have to dig out of Nokes (and McClagan) yourself.

"It's irrational to legally tolerate one set of deadly addictive substances(alcohol&tobacco) while hypocritically demonising&criminalising another set of popular substances&their persecuted users.

Alcohol prohibition only served to make the mafia rich, powerful,&more violent. People continued to drink in huge numbers,despite alcohol's illegality. NY City alone had 5,000 illegal speakeasies during prohibition.Prohibition also made booze more dangerous than it otherwise would be.  1,000 Americans died each year during prohibition from toxic booze,typically incorrectly distilled hard liquor with deadly methyl, instead of ethyl, alcohol.

We see the same pattern of failure with drugs prohibition.Drug gang ultra-violence, heightened OD risk from unregulated black market drugs of uncertain content,property crime by addicts paying artifically sky-high black market prces for substances dirt cheap to produce, - all these serious & worsening problems are created by prohibition, not drugs.End it."

"Wow, I just got one STRANGE warning from the ""Civil Comments"" system.

Up popped one of the posts I was supposed to assess for suitability.

The post said something like this:

""Islam as described in the Koran can never be satisfied until Islam has overtaken infidel beliefs worldwide - as described in the Koran it is an expansionist ideology that requires preeminent status and so you might as well start learning more about its features sooner rather than later"". 

Well, I voted that the post was okay and was civil, and WHAM!, my whole webpage went black and these big words in an angry-looking red font came up saying something like ""WARNING: YOU HAVE FAILED TO REJECT A POST THAT YOU SHOULD HAVE REJECTED, YOU MUST EMPLOY MORE SCRUTINY AND SINCERITY IN YOUR ASSESSMENT EFFORTS"".

As for your allegation that ""Peters ... had definitely crossed a line,"" since when has a woman been *sincerely* offended by being described as ""hot""? Officially offended, sure.

"My understanding is that there is indeed a great deal of bias - towards diversity. Tests which had applicants send out identical applications both for students and hiring found that those who were female were far more likely to be accepted than males, and visible minorities even moreso.

.
The idea is NIMBYism run wild.  The same basic arguments were used two generations ago to try to enforce ""covenants"" not to sell to black people or Jews.

Have we learned nothing from that experience?
.
If you don't like your new neighbours, or you don't like that they have received planning permission to adapt the property to a higher valued use, you are free to sell your property to the highest bidder, accordingly.

What your neighbour has done, most likely, is to make your property more valuable.
If the neighbour were imposing a negative externality on you, you might have grounds for complaint.  But you're gaining a windfall - and still complaining!"

"Respectfully, if you refer to advocating black inmates take revenge on this pathetic little coward who murdered those who WELCOMED him among them according to the Messiah's admonishments concerning hospitality to strangers, I very much understand his 'sentiments'.  The Creator has promised to punish the unrepentant according to their deeds.  May Roof be murdered nine times after arriving in hell, and then shunned as a pariah therein for eternity--just as his victims were maltreated as if they were less than human all their lives under Jim Crow terror and tyranny, and thereafter had to watch helplessly as their youth were gunned down by both criminals and the cops who were supposed to protect them, until finally being murdered themselves.

Were it up to me, Roof would be stripped naked, plastered with hog-slop, kneecapped then thrown into a pit full of starving pigs.  And I say this knowing that to torture mortals is hara'am (Islamically unlawful).  Lannatullahi alayhi alf mura'at."

"Thank God for video proof! Again, LEO lies about why they shot an unarmed black man.

"There are outpourings of sorrow and concern for police that die in the line of duty; as there should be! Where is the equivalent national sobbing and tear fest when unarmed Americans (especially Black Americans) are shot and killed by police? Aren't their lives just as valuable? Isn't the loss to their family and community just as heartbreaking? When a law enforcement officer is killed, every effort is made to find and punish the killer. When police shoot and kill an unarmed citizen, (like a 12 year old Black child playing with a pellet gun), they get a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card. This cannot continue! It is an abomination on this country! And maybe this unpunished killing of unarmed citizens by Police is why crazy people walk up to a Law Enforcement Officer they don't even know and shoot them."

In time Muslims will be accepted....you are putting in your time to be accepted; as horrible as that sounds it is true... just as the French did, Catholics,  Irish, Jews, Blacks, etc.....

The evidence provided indicates nothing about carpetbaggers as you claimed but about voting.

Where exactly did it say that?  Because the way I read it, it started in Tennessee in 1866 and quickly spread beyond it.  Forrest may have tried to end it when he quit a year after he was elected but the article indicates that Forrest didn't speak for any chapters outside Tennessee (Forrest claimed that the Klan had 40,000 members in Tennessee and 550,000 total members throughout the Southern states) but he didn't have any formal ties with them, ie. his orders have no effect on them.

Yes with the caveat that if 4 or more people are involved its defined as a mass shooting: A guy goes into the 7-11 robs the places and shoots the clerk there are 6 people inside the store=MASS SHOOTING. Very misleading. 
""Real"" mass shootings where the crazy has an AR or whatever happen less frequently than the media portrays. Disregarding suicides: aprox 80% of gun violence takes place in major cities where a HANDGUN is used by a young black male against another young black male. Mass shootings vs regular ol' gun violence is like plane crash vs car crash statistics: The plane crash kills hundreds of people at once. Horrible! they happen very infrequently but they are BIG NEWS! The car crash only kills a tiny number of people. but they happen so frequently that the news doesn't care even though the body count is huge! 30,000 auto deaths per year."

The Sacrament of Holy Orders isn't just another career path and it isn't just about whether women should get to be leaders and make decisions.  It is far more than that.  This is the whole problem with feminists.  They have to turn every discussion into ""But you just want women barefoot and pregnant in the kitchen being slaves to their husbands"" bit.

"I command the author wrote this article but to me racism is racism and there is no lesser or ""casual"" form of it.  All I can say is living in Canada for many years as an ethnically Chinese person I did had my fair share of racism encounters and sometimes I did receive especially rude treatment and I tried not to think because it was due to me being a Chinese-looking person but I supposed it could be the reason as the author suggested.  Canadia often like to boast about being a multicultural and tolerant society but all of that is just hollow rhetoric when people of color still receive so much racism in society and that any suggestion racism is a serious problem in Canada would often met with such dismissive, angry or even more racist responses."

"Why would you accuse these numerous pastors in Eugene of being tools of Satan? That is clearly your meaning, as sinful people are the tools of Satan, not inanimate objects. Perhaps you did not understand the Bible where Jesus states that it is not what goes in our mouths that defiles us, but the words that come out of our mouths. This demonstrates that it is not food that is bad (or particular foods), but the hurtful words from our hearts. Similarly, it is not firearms that are bad, but the way some people may use them to hurt innocent people. Are AR-15s bad in the hands of police who use them to stop a terrorist in Dallas, or is it the terrorist himself who is using one to kill police while they protect Black Lives Matter demonstrators? God hates evil actions and thoughts, not inanimate objects. And the law being broken is one made by our clueless legislators, not one made by God. They should rescind that law so they will not have to charge the Reverend or any other good citizen."

Otherwise, your charge of racism is odious . . . racism being one of the worst things a person can be (IMHO)."
"Hlabirwa, if you read the submitted documents and the arguments you will actually come to realise that Solidarity and AfriForum wants more potential black athletes to rise to the top. The thing is it should be accomplished by recognising talent early and developing them. To enforce a racially biased system from the top-down however, without developing from grassroots level is not sustainable nor effective. More should be done to develop young sport stars and thats where our failing economy, government and dysfunctional schooling system is failing our children"
"Asking  police to ""leave their uniforms, weapons and vehicles behind""  isn't being unreasonable.  After all, the others aren't wearing anything.   Nothing wrong with funding Pride, but the arguments expose a deep racial fissure between blacks and others.  You see it on university campuses now as well.  The deep division was inevitable once the black power movements began demanding ""inclusion"" to mean a melting pot -- what multi-culturalism in Canada had meant to avoid.  Now we're just like the U.S., but more vulnerable because of feeling guilt."
"The police prosecutions in Baltimore went before a black Judge and former Federal Prosecutor who prosecuted police misconduct and he found three of them Not Guilty and the other case was before a bi-racial jury and came out as a Hung Jury.  

Prosecution was a political act by Mosby to prevent riots but the facts actually proven in court did not meet the legal standard for conviction."
"Thanks for sharing your experience Hadiya.
As a black man I second your experience. I know many other black women and men who feel the same way.
Keep working hard and being an inspiration to us all.
By the way, I heard of this term recently. It puts a label on your exact statement.
Allostatic load - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allostatic_load
""Nowadays in Canada, overt acts of racism are rare. Instead, the subtle ones tire you out and wear your sense of belonging. They happen more often, more insidiously."""
"Among the roughly 6,000 cases in which the race of the victim and the offender were known, the number of blacks killed by blacks rose to 2,380 last year, an increase of about 8 percent from 2014.

I'd call that uppity."
"The editor made a mistake.  It was in 1991 and Obama was only 30, not an important author and mistakes happen. It wasn't Obama who wrote that.   It was corrected and should have been end of story yet Breitbart and Snopes and The Donald chose to run with a story they KNEW to be false.    There is NO EXCUSE for Trump haranguing Obama during his Presidency, the first black President,  to ""show his papers"".  No excuse for Trump's bad behavior.  He is the one who appears to be completely corrupt - just like in this article.  He doesn't act like an innocent man.  Now the Donald should show his tax returns and be transparent with his business dealings in Russia and the Middle East and allow this investigation continue, unfettered.."
If they were as offended by the unfair and unjust treatment that black and ethnic minorities in this country face the patriotic virtue signalers would have a lot more credibility.
"That's equivalent to arguing that all black people are oppressed and should be offended by the comment; An inherently racist argument. Some people, regardless of skin pigment, genuinely don't care to clutch pearls at the slightest of slights....they understand nuance and those who declined to sign the petition realized this was not a hill worth dying (or killing) on. Rather low-hanging fruit from a morally righteous perspective. The professor's comments were a relative non-issue but torpedoing his life's work after lamely collecting a few dozen signatures was an easy win. Kudos."
"So Schill is going to spend millions to build a hide-away for the black students who make up 1% of the student population as a sop for not meeting their demands to rename Deady Hall. Absolutely  unconscienable. The university has no business favoring one racial or ethnic group over another. The university needs more integration of students, not less."
"How do you know they don't focus on reading, writing etc? Have you ever been to one? Your comparison to all black schools in the 1960's sooth is weak. It is more comparable to HCBUs, where blacks voluntarily decided to form there own colleges, not they were forced to by the people in power. Unless they are advocating violent actions, homeland security ha no business. The are free to petition the govt to redress their wrongs, are they not?"
His sentence had nothing to do with being black.  It had to do with a lifetime of petty crime.  Did you read the article?
There are many different kinds of privilege. Just because he is financially well off does not negate the issues that he and others have faced just for  being black in America.

"Naturally the media seeks out the handful of deviants to cast aspirations at Trump.  No attempt to compare the rate of transgressions on a normal day to those described here.  The kids with black make-up are likely simply making a statement about freedom of expression rather than what the media insists is racism.  I must admit, I am tempted to put on black make-up just to demand the right of freedom of expression.  Leave it to the media to try to inject devisiveness.  Let us join together reaffirming the value of every citizen regardless of heritage and focus on opportunities and new horizons."
"Florida is rather conservative.... but if the hispanic and black communities can be supportive, it might be possible to defeat Scott. It would also be nice if the candidates could speak fluent Spanish and have good connections within the black community. Short of that they'll need strong endorsements from leaders and celebrities in both communities."
"LMAO....you're barking up the wrong tree....try that argument with someone who grew up rich...not me!  The only ""rich"" relative I can think of having was a cousin, who skippered a PT Boat in WWII, got out, and went to medical school, becoming a surgeon....although, I have no idea how ""rich"" he was...I know I wore his kids' hand-me downs to school through HS (and I was the Oldest of the 6 in my family...so my brothers got them after me!)  I DO know there is a black family in the Atlanta GA area with the same last name as me.  They are filthy rich with a cosmetics line, and there's a Bishop in some Christian Church down there (I've seen him on TV), and I believe it might be his sons who do gospel music and have albums out.  Using race as an excuse for one's failure to succeed is BS.  You have to start respecting yourself, if you expect others to respect you.  Everything I got, I worked my a$$ off for.  Try it sometime."

Yeah, and fathers raping their daughters used to be normal too. But things change.

"For DECADES we had been making progress with our 'treatment' of blacks in America. I travel a lot and don't live in a fantasy world like some. Since Obama was elected ""because we needed to show the world we could elect a black individual"" his RACE BAITING tactics have done everything possible to shred the progress we had made. We have lost decades of hard work and understanding due to ONE MAN AND HIS ACTIONS! YET we still hear people sing his praise, though not so many blacks today... 

Hillary would have continued his destructive path while wearing her MASK of tolerance and understanding for the poor and down trodden. Her ONLY interest - as is the interest of MOST Democrats - is getting out the BLACK vote BECAUSE IT IS THE ONLY WAY A DEMOCRAT CAN BE ELECTED TO OFFICE!  

BLACKS in America have come a long way, they have proven that they can stand side by side with the 'elites' and contribute! Without Obama and Clinton to hold them back they will continue to thrive and be productive!"

"You don't get it.   It's not the action, it's the message.  I simply don't agree with them, by choice.  I could care less about the President, I don't support him either.  I disagree with the black community laying sole blame on law enforcement without taking any responsibility for participation.  Highlight a bad shooting and ignore the countless deaths of police officers and their fellow community members.  Demand that officers don't have a right to remain safe and insist that every contact is racist and corrupt.  They don't get my support, sorry."
"I'll even further your education on slavery. Anthony Johnson was the first Slave owner in British America (yes before the USA). Anthony went to court and won to keep John Casor as property for life. Thereby allowing / starting slavery in America.

"You are, at the very least, mistaken. Black Lives Matter has legitimate claims, as do other groups.  Far more citizens are killed by police than police killed by citizens, and far more citizens are arrested and prosecuted for crimes that when committed by police are ignored."
"Or a second generation immigrant with a college education seeking a professional position where you were obliged to change your last name to sound less foreign in order to be hired.

"Which explains your distored view of black Americans.   There are millions of black professionals in America, men and women.  If the only thing you can see are the gangs, then the only thing you watch is the Portland news that reports it.   

What has become of those black soilders you got along with in the military?"
"I agree with this comment almost entirely.  Yet it still does not explain why 8% of the black vote went to the unspeakable Trump. My guess is that like most voters who voted for ""improbable things"" and against their most probable candidate, Trump held out the promise of more interest and cap gains on $avings and equitie$. The same may apply to the approximately 40% of women who voted for the bizarre orange man, despite his gross and verifiable sexist comments. Money Trumped everything in some voting booths. Just breaking the vote down into colour and sex does not go nearly far enough. Break it down into money."
"Lies?
The biggest lie back then was that it was somehow fair to give college deferments from the military draft - allowing some  to avoid service and their family friends and neighbors to avoid thinking the conflict through.
The biggest lie today is that it is fair for our wars to be fought by ""all-volunteers"" - giving us a military that is too black, too brown, and too poor - and allowing some segments of society to not think the conflict through."

"Your reply makes no sense. I am not wrong at all, it is you who is incorrect on your facts. My opinions are not unsubstantiated, they are completely substantiated. If they are hurtful to you, it may be because there are facts here of which you choose to be unaware. Liberals tend to be more highly educated and use reason more than conservatives, who work from raw gut emotion. First, JFK didn't deputize the state's national guard, he federalized them, which he was legally authorized to do under existing USC. Here, Trump and Sessions completely lack authority to federalize or deputize local law enforcement agencies that do not consent to be federalized. 

So your example of Kennedy and the Alabama NG is completely unsubstantiated, wrong, ignorant and misinformed, to use your own words. Your zeal to push your unconstitutional position is driving you to post unsubstantiated and hurtful opinions.

Yes, racists are conservative. There is no dispute on this. That's how they vote. QED."
"Agreed.

And while I do not agree with discrimination in any form, that which is being perpetuated in workplaces today, while unfair, is something that I think we will figure out relatively quickly and move on from.

That which has and is being perpetuated against blacks in America is much more serious and unfortunately, enduring."
"She is making up accusation based on southern US black racism, because she knows nobody would dare contradict her. I had a  best buddy in the 1980s (now dead of AIDS) who was from the Blood Band near Lethbridge. He had true horror stories about growing up gay on the reserve. He and his whole family faced endless violence and property damage  from band members  and open discrimination by the band council for  it."
Niger is about 95% Muslim and mostly Sunni. However Arab Missionaries— Saudi’s— are bringing conservative Wahhabite teachings to Niger and that is the first step to jihadist groups like Al Quaeda who were the attackers here. Things are also heating up elsewhere in Africa— in Somalia and Djibouti and commanders are seeking additional troops— about 200 were sent to Somalia and the first addition since 1993 (the year of “Blackhawk Down”). When will it end.
"""Anti-Semitism was the order of the day during apartheid.""
It was? First I've heard of it. Jewish people did more to finance institutions and organisations than the average non-Jew.

"Colonialism occured on many countries and continents at various times in history and to varying degrees of brutality. In some cases, such as the USA and Australia, systematic genocide was visited upon their indigenous populations, while elswhere, examples of softer oppresions were applied. In South Africa specifically, softer oppresion in the colonial era occurred and no genocide (as defined by the systematic wholesale slaughter of ethnic groups) happened. Prior to the colonial era, genocidal actions were common, with the Mfecane and eradication of Koi Bushmen by black African hordes as they marched South and West in colonial expansion.
The Holocaust was different in that a vast people defined only by their religion, were slaughtered on an industrial scale on the back of a racist ideology. Very different. European Jews were citizens of the country in which they were wiped out for being of the Jewish religion. No comparison can be made excepting by anti-semitic racists."
"(cont) and most other issues about which they complain. And so, essentially, reflection on the conditions in which so many Black people live begins and ends with an assessment of their moral (and often more general) deficiencies. That was the sense of, ""they deserve it""  I was intending, that their sufferings were primarily the consequence of their own shortcomings. 

I have been trying to argue that the larger society has it's own moral shortcomings, expressed in unilateral actions towards Black people, to their detriment, and that we are responsible for the harms we have caused, no less than those kids with guns. I'm trying to argue for moral accountability for everyone, not just for those we have abused for hundreds of years. 

Anderson's book goes into the effects of Brown in some detail. There have been some salutary consequences, but their scope was not remotely proportionate to the previous harms, and those gains made have tapered off considerably.

They boycott the inauguration the same way many black voters boycotted the election. They didn't vote for Hillary just as they didn't vote against Trump. Then they  complain their voices aren't being heard.  We do in fact hear their voices. But it is up to them to make up their minds.

"Liz's article, commencing with a call to action via an epigram by Neil deGrasse Tyson to ""get smart,"" is a brilliant personal and professional cautionary tale which all must heed. It is instructive to understand that no matter the changing and unchanging of different geographic demographics, whitelash rears its very public head:  at rock concerts during which the confederate flag is raised; when African American leaders are mass murdered in their church; where in HAWAI'I, racism is manifested in passive-aggressive whispers and gestures.  It is present where every day, a black person, whether a minister or fast food worker, is pulled over by a law enforcement officer and is forced to comply quietly and meekly, enduring humiliation just in case the officer is a racist and has license to murder. Re-energized acts of racism and all forms of bigotry necessitate the call to ""get smart"" by informing, volunteering, engaging on every level to inspire the human race to ""get smart' again. IMUA"
"Loughner was a registered Independent. The Ft Hood shooter's political affiliation is unknown (and likely irrelevant). The Virgina Tech shooter wasn't a citizen, so you just made that part up. The Colorado theater shooter wasn't registered to vote. The Newtown shooter's mother was a Republican, but we don't know what her son's party was, if any. I understand how confusing it can get when you're looking for any opportunity to smear an entire group you don't like. Mistakes happen.

Now, if you can bear to separate party affiliation from political leaning, we could recount the number of acts of mass violence that were fueled by intolerance, hatred, fear of black presidents, or opposition to any form of central government. Would you like to play that game?"
"I agree with all this - especially about the ""Big Bang"" being a fairly tale perpetrated by biased fantasies of those in search of federal research grants. Homosexuality is most certainly a choice, the Obamacare quote is a metaphor, how one can ""see"" ""Global Warming"" is beyond me, and if you want to lay down a million years worth of records then feel free - perhaps then you may be able to get the other half of the world to believe you, PP thrives in poor black communities, racism is just like any other crime, which is perpetrated by a few people (but not a crime) and does NOT reflect the masses of dissenters. Obamacare pays people JUST enough to depend on it and does not motivate anybody to improve.

"Wrong. Land ownership and prosperity are not directly linked. Study this list and note how many prosperous countries have relatively low levels of home ownership: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_home_ownership_rate

What IS directly linked is national prosperity and the legal protection of all private property (including intellectual property). Your racist, outdated ideologies will INCREASE suffering and deprivation.

If you want to increase home and land ownership among black people, give title deeds to the 18 million people living under traditional leadership. The real question is: why haven't you done this yet? If the ANC genuinely cared about poor black people, you would have done this within your first five years in power."
"Roman Catholic Women Priests, most of them, have the same Divinity Degrees required from the same Universities-they are trained.  Priest training is not a clandestine training.  Anyone can look up class curriculum and agendas and satisfy this training on their own with similar procedures as the seminaries use.

You are correct, sexism like racism is a form of hatred.  So when our church treats women less than men & strips them of their sacred rights to equal sacraments, it is an act of hatred & sin to do so, just as much as stripping a black man from his right to be a priest based on his skin color would be an act of hatred.  

We have sinned in the past.  Some our church's orders owned black slaves in America.  I will call hatred hate, and sexism is hatred. 

Our laws demand we treat all the same and follow the Great Commandment as a dogma and our Canon Law then states, as mere doctrine or tradition, we ordain only men.  Canon law cannot support attacks against anyone's human dignity."
"Yes, but it is those he called out as alt-righters that act with such an intensity of hate that they need to be called out and often.  If that kid in QC was called out more for being a mean spirited troll maybe he would have taken a step back and spared the lives of those innocent people praying (maybe not).   Scoundrels that are found on these boards need to be called out and more...as of now they are taking over and finding comfort in each others arms; thanks SUN and NP for closing your boards . 

They do grow it is just hard for them....consider 20 years ago they would be raging against homosexuals or black people.  Now for the most part these groups are thankfully accepted (despite BLM's claims to the contrary - stats seem to suggest only 8% fear either Jews, Blacks or homosexuals; however it is far higher for Muslims; ridiculous).  It takes time and these clowns don't listen to compassion, that is weakness to them....so call them out for what they are...low effort angry thinkers."

"I'm not going to get into details because I'd prefer to keep myself anonymous but I do put my money where my mouth is on this issue. 

You correct this by fixing the opportunity gap. You shouldn't only have access to sub par education because you're in a black neighborhood. People think that because segregation ended then things are fine, and everything is fair. But that's not the case. The effects of racist policies impact multiple generations. 

When it comes to public education every student deserves the same quality of education. If you live in Palo Alto for example you shouldn't have schools in ruin on one side of the highway and elite over-funded schools on the other side. 

Obviously different regions to a point will have different resources. But the idea that a rich neighborhood within city limits gets better schools is fundamentally unfair. This is not just a racial issue but the reason it affects people of color more is the result of explicitly racist past policies."
So you consider Hispanic people and middle eastern/African refugees barbarians?

They act because states victimize minorities, from blacks, to women, to gays, to Latinos, to immigrants to Catholics in Alabama."

"In the Holy Bible, Genesis 1:27-28 says that God created people as either distinctly male or distinctly female.  It should be carefully noted that God did not create people and then let them decide what they would be.  The Bible says that God is the One who decides how humans are to behave sexually and within the scope of their gender. God says a woman must not wear men's clothing, nor a man wear woman clothing, for the Lord your God detests anyone who does this. The entire Bible context is that of men and women each operating within the biology given to them by the one true God who created all things.
  The LGBT which includes Transgenders are hiding behind the mask of the Civil Rights movement which doesn't belong to them.

Yeah, I think that would have done it!

"Something is deeply wrong with the GOP. Even when the Obama/Democrats had control, they reached, way, WAY, across the aisle, and more or less adopted the right's plan and got it passed.


But, since he's not only a Democrat, but also black, the GOP has been irrationally lying about not only the plan, but working to sabotage it and hope no one notices what they are up to.


And they seem singularly obsessed with repealing what is essentially HeritageCare while offering no viable alternatives."
"Full face covering is probably common only in Saudi Arabia (been there, seen that). As for being taken seriously, how many innocent people do you think have been executed in the US, in hte last 20 years? They usually tend to be black and poor. Because their court appointed defenders are not interested in their defense. And their prosecutor knows a successful conviction helps his political career.

Women are not equal anywhere, except perhaps Scandinavia. A woman cannot become the President of the USA, even though they form 51 percent of the population. The same is true of Canada. 

25 percent of the children in Canada and 42 percent in the US are born to single mothers. That is the worst thing a man can do to a woman - impregnate her and leave. A lack of free daycare ensures that these women don't progress in their careers. 

So instead of all this pain about Muslim women, perhaps it is time to focus on the status of women here."
"I have always had so much sympathy for young black men. 

I can't imagine what it would be like to always live under a cloud of suspicion, to watch people spontaneously hold their handbags close when they see you, to be stopped by the police for no apparent reason.

In the past couple of years, when I see a black person pulled over for a ""traffic violation"", I stop my car hoping that my stares will prevent the person from being roughed up."
"Why does a citizen with a broken-down car have to put his hands up in the first place? When did police become so anti-citizen agains the populations they are paid to ""serve and protect"" that a citizen is approached in a suspicious, hostile manner merely because his car breaks down? I can remember when police approached us to help us and unless we did something to indicate we were dangerous, they assumed we were law-abiding citizens in need of assistance.

I can plainly see why ethnic minorities, especially Black males, feel threatened by police. Just because your car breaks down, police approach you with orders to put your hands in the air, and how many others have been shot before you find yourself in that situation?

If I had my back turned, I wouldn't hear orders to stop or to do anything else, because I am hard of hearing and I can't hear people behind me, nor understand what they are saying if they are in front of me but a few feet away. Police need to be more careful."
"A ""sick and depraved"" attack - as the British are calling this, is correct.

But why is it never ""sick and depraved"" when ""we"" do so much worse to innocent Muslim women and children - millions brutally killed over the last 30 years - in the Middle East and Africa?

There can never be a justification for this kind of violence it seems, except when ""we"" inflict it on others.

Why do we never hear of the ""heroes"" who pull out burning children from under US and NATO bombs? Why do we never hear of the weeping husband cradling the smashed bodies of his wife and children after a drone attack?

The problems of global terrorism and war, can only be solved by all of humanity working together. It appears that we still have a really long way to go."
"OK CBC gets points for assembling their anchor team with representatives of the south Asian and Asian communities as well as with 2 women but then also loses points by forgetting to add at least one token black. Ideally, a black stuttering lesbian woman who lost the use of her legs in a skydiving accident should have been what they were aiming for with at least one of the candidates. Tsk tsk."
"Everyone knows exactly which attribute you are attempting to impugn when that word is uttered. It's meant to be the worst thing that you can say to a male because it emasculates them or at least that's the intention. Do gay men sometimes use that word? Yes. Just as black people sometimes use the N word to refer to each other. That gives literally no other human being on the planet permission to use it. When you grow up having that word hurled at you every day and live in fear that it will be followed by fists then maybe, just maybe you can use that word. The psychological damage that that slur has inflicted on gay youth is immersurable - it demeans the very core being of a person."
"T. Robson,I look about 40-I'm 64-and retained those boyish good looks.There's a saying,""Black don't crack,"" referring to us black folks' tendency to age quite well.(Though I have a cousin who'll soon be 65,was also a boyishly handsome young man,but now looks about 80 because of decades of dissipation.)"
One of the places the Church could outreach that would do the BLM kids some good would be to outreach Catholic police in order to help them stop operating on accepted assumptions that all younger black males are out to kill them.  It maybe the best outreach the Church can do is not in parishes but in communities.  In think that's where Cardinal Cupich is headed in Chicago and it can't come too soon.
"What are you saying CivilSociety, that you agree the the Black Liberation Collective SHOULD attain its goals through violent means?"
"The saw about politics applies to all of it: the process of making a bill, like that of a sausage, ain't pretty. 
Politics is a blood-sport. Everyone gets splashed, mangled, transformed.
But a democratic republic is the best system ever devised. Imagine if liberals/progressives had refused to vote until the perfect (whatever that could mean) candidate came along. We'd be a country to the right of Putin's Russia by now.
Any observer of American history must see that progress always has come slowly---------- but it HAS come.
I align myself with those who feel that a society should be judged by how it treats its least powerful citizens. African-Americans, during my lifetime, have vastly improved their lives, overall, but a long struggle remains.
I cannot imagine a Latina or a Muslim smiling at Ms. Porter right now. Her lackadaisical approach to their real issues must be frightening. A Trump presidency greatly would disturb or ruin their lives."
"It's just the tip of the iceberg. Totally substantiated through court, police, and medical records. Not all cops are racist, but it is a systemic problem, not just a few bad apples. And good people go along so as not to be ostracized. It's a problem and a black police chief would go a long way toward handling it. You are free to disagree of course, but that's my opinion."
"Paul,

being Indian, speaking two Indian languages (with some understanding of a third Indian language) helps me understand the Dalit issue far more than you. Unless you are going to claim that you are Indian too?

When there are 300 million Dalits, there are multiple facts that one can use to make any case. Are the Dalits better off than they were twenty years ago? Yes. Is there discrimination against them? Yes. The Sachar committee report has showed that the Dalits have overtaken the Muslims. Now if you are an Arabic speaker, you would know that the Muslims were the ruling class in India before the British came. So there has been a lot of churning in Indian society. 

And yet, there has been relatively less violence despite this churn. India has one of the least amount of ISIS members, despite having 180 million Muslims. Because the Dalit authored constitution has enforced democracy. In 1947, all Dalits could vote. All Blacks in the US couldn't. All Natives in Canada couldn't."

"What does that have to do with your contention that 94% of black voters are paid by welfare to vote Democratic? Nothing. Zero. Nada. Or are you claiming that only black Americans care about Social Security and Medicare? LOL. You just keep digging yourself in deeper as you make stuff up about black people. And that's why black Americans eschew the Republican party. You make things up to demonize and marginalize black Americans. The more you comment, the more I realize I will NEVER vote for your anti-black political party."

"""The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar Left, and black people. You understand what I'm saying? We knew we couldn't make it illegal to be either against the war or black. But by getting the public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.""   - John Erlichman, Counsel and assistant to Richard M. Nixon

The lies never stop. Alcohol, cigarettes, and pharmaceutical opiates are all big business - and all proven killers and destroyer of lives.  Pot, however, continues to be vilified - and somehow it continues to be vilified by those who profit from cigarettes, alcohol, pharmaceutical opiates, and the criminal justice system."
"At some point you have to ""pull yourself up with your bootstraps"" isn't that what you all told black and brown users in the 80's? Stop blaming other people for your issues, stop waiting for people to step in and save you when you can do it yourself. That is, if you really want to. Lazy middle americans, thats exactly what you get for supporting a know racist, bigoted supremacist just as yourself I suppose."
"What is with racism and the NFL. The NFL has been a pon by the race baiters for years. At a time it was the percentage of black player's but no black head coaches, then black head coaches were hired, and it didn't fix anything. The country elected a black president, twice, and it didn't fix anything. And now we come to today. What is the complaint? The players are upset, because Trump dis them? WOW. That's it. The players and the left say they're are not disrespecting the flag, then why do it during the National Anthem? To bring attention? Attention to what? Attention to the condition in the black communities, how is taking a knee going change anything? Rather then taking a knee, shouldn't these players, tell those in the black communities how THEY made it. Haven't NFL players experienced guilt by association, by the police, has all of us has at a time in are lives, by the type of car they drive.  The players are being use as pon as much as the NFL."
"This fine article is a cautionary tale about the dangers of jumping to conclusions. First, officer Coleman did in his investigation, then the media in their reporting of the aftermath of that failure.

In the dumbed-down America of the 21st century we want our news succinct and simple, with easy to spot heroes and villains that reinforce our biases. Black drug users, racist Texas towns -- those are things we can get our heads around.

Complexity, on the other hand, just harshes our mellow."
"What is way more offensive than this mural could possibly ever be is that awful Blaine Fontaine mural in Alberta that declares, in Fontaine's typical platitudinous Hallmark fashion, ""You are only confined by the walls you build yourself!""

"The columnist is not very clear on HOW she thinks Hollywood has changed, in her eyes

I mean, is she trying to imply that, in past recent years, there was an unfair bigotry that refused to hand out awards to deserving black folks for their top-notch work? If so, what candidates were involved - which performance by a black actor or actress, which film by a black director, was unfairly overlooked in recent years?

Or is she trying to recognize that this year's award selectors were faced with a large number of black folks in prominent screen roles in successful films, and if so, did that arise because film producers afforded more funding this year for films involving black artists, or did it arise because audiences nowadays are more open to flocking to movies with prominent roles for black artists, or did it arise because the movies this year with black artists happen to have hit themes or narratives especially attractive to broad audiences?

It is actually kind of unclear what she meant."
"The movement is not based on a lie. Whether Michael Brown's shooting was justified is irrelevant (just like you), as it's not the only shooting of an unarmed black man by police. You must be simple."

Doing what is right should not need to be praised. Too many times those who knew something didn't speak up. The latest is Omar's family who knew and did nothing. The FBI failed. The government in general in all areas are inept and failing. What has done the most harm has been the actions of Bush and Obama administrations in the middle east. Yes Hillary had a big part in creating chaos. As Trump said today Muslims have suffered the most by radical Islamic terrorists. It has nothing to do with being bigots or hateful narratives. Statistics and facts. Just like when you say that black on black crime is what kills the most you are called a racist. As long as we allow the political class ( two wings on the same vulture) divide us we have no chance. United we stand.
"black lawmakers make partisan political rants based on ignorance since sessions has been a fighter who not only prosecuted the KKK racist, but convicted and sued for 8 million bankrupting them, he also saw the confiction of a racist murderer who was executed etc,, time for the dems to realize they were soundly defeated across america and get with the program."
"As readers will recall, the black martyr, Michael Brown, committed strong-arm robbery after getting stoned;  then proceeded to walk down the middle of a busy street with his lying (hands up, don't shoot) accomplice;  when a policeman asked them to move to the sidewalk, Brown assaulted the officer and tried to steal the officer's gun;  in the struggle the gun discharged in the officer's car;  then Brown left the car and ran away only to come back and charge the officer;  Brown was shot.

After the incident, the officer had to go into hiding because of numerous death threats;  later, after an investigation which revealed the above-noted facts, it was determined that the officer acted lawfully.

The ""protests"" referred to in this column also included rioting where black mobs looted and burned numerous stores.

Brown has become one of the many ""martyrs"" of BLM as well as figures like Colin Kaepernick."
"The Americans elected a lecturer and that is what they got - a guy who from time to time lectures them but doesn't accomplish much of anything.

"What a good story honoring a hero and someone has to play the race card.  How much lower can the race baiters get but to condemn a hero by mentioning another hero  Doris (Dorey) Miller  and claiming he was not honored because he was black.  What a disservice to have no idea that Mr. Miller was also honored but to not even know his name and refer to him as the ""BLACK guy"".   Mr. Miller was also honored for his heroism and to call him the ""BLACK guy"" and use him to make a point is really low .  If you think this is not a racially based remark, why was black in all caps."
"You are partially correct.

I looked at the charts again and indeed, racial crimes against blacks did exceed crimes against jews.

However, your assertion that  hate crimes against wiccans exceeded  hate crimes against jews is laughable."
"Who is the Alt Left?  Alt Right is a self described group WITHIN the right wing conservative party who have extreme right wing ideas.  They wish to separate themselves from the Republican Party.  The Alt Left is a term MADE UP by the Alt Right to provide a foe to their ideology which gives them credibility.

The implication in this post is the MSM is a partner to the ALT LEFT term which is both highly dangerous and simply incorrect.  It feeds the Alt Right agenda.

As such, the content of the above post is simply wrong and misleading.  To imply Obama favours people who break the law is disingenuous, factually wrong, and dangerous.  This poster relates Dreamers in Chicago with the issue of gun violence in that city.  Again, a highly dangerous statement and implication.

These racist posts need to be called out for what they are."
"Did anybody ask   police officers how many times a day / week/ month / year they have had, if not criminal encounters  but nerve wracking aggressive confrontations with  young blacks who resort to yelling, screaming and vulgar cursing,  spitting, fists raised,  that is out of step with normal behavior ?   No of course not."
"It is the very poor and the middle class that has suffered the most from the programs of the Progressives.  The irony is that the very poor including many blacks and hispanics are the groups who in mass vote for the Democrats, Progressives, Socialists....whatever you want to call them!  The middle class thrived under Reagan and even Clinton but that reversed when Bush took office and then exponentially worsened when Obama took office.  History has shown that no matter how high you raise the minimum wage nothing really changes as the price of living just adjusts up to a higher number of dollars.  Minimum wage is not meant to give the entry level worker a standard of living out of line with their skill levels.  The success of this country is in providing OPPORTUNITY,  not end results.  Hard work is the answer to providing better results!  HARD WORK!!!!!!!!!!!!! When November comes, Don't vote for anyone who says he or she will provide everything in life for FREE! There is NO FREE!"
"I recall black Eugene city councilor Greg Evans telling the Council, sometime in the last year, that he was fed up with the police stopping his son for no good reason.

I also note the continuing harassment of homeless people in downtown Eugene, also for no good reason. From Facebook:

Manly Hall Posted 8-6-16: This woman in the wheelchair and her caretaker have been living on the K. Plz. blocks for two months in the soft kill zone. Without shelter / decent food, constantly assaulted by the the general public, (dirty looks / snide remarks) sleep deprivation, and POLICE interactions. Oh and they are so polite to them (police) - but still, MOVE ALONG.

Now I thought Sheltercare came and got them. NO! WRONG! She was at Riverbend having her TOE removed! AND IS NOW OUTSIDE Starbuck's (K. Sq.) DYING IN THE SOFT KILL ZONE RIGHT NOW! GET IT?!?

"Stereotyping is probably the biggest cause of our current public unease. It is not a new problem; it is a thinking skill or lack thereof that challenges us all. When we fail to appreciate the individuality and uniqueness of others, then it becomes easier to make blanket assessments. (Some examples come to mind:  Immigrants might be rapists; POWs are losers; journalists are liars; black people have unhealthy eating habits.)  We all have sloppy thinking.  We should try to do less of it, not more. The foundational flaw in your response is the fact that you were stereotyping an entire group and then pointing the finger at all sorts of other things to defend your sloppy conclusions."
"So how about the protests they are carrying out protesting police brutality and uncalled for police shooting unarmed black men and children, that they are not held accountable?

I clearly see who is the racist here"
"AG, yes absolutely right. Antifa and BLM orchestrate violence, they provoke it then if anything happens the media immediately blames the other side. By forcing the protesters (who from everything I saw just wanted to protest the removal of significant historical statues) to walk thru the gauntlet of known violent anti-protesters the Governor was creating an obvious confrontation. They wanted it, they provoked it and they made it happen, all to further a false narrative that America is this big racist stronghold. That concept would be laughable except that so many people can be duped into believing it. For one thing our ""HATE"" laws have made it virtually impossible to act out any real racism, secondly, if America is so racist why do all these people of color risk their lives to get here? I keep asking how stupid can you get but some people take it as a challenge."

"I think the point this article misses is it is not just words and ideas: given the opportunity, Nazis and their ilk WILL unleash a violent reign of terror that will dwarf what happened at that protest. Letting Nazis have a platform emboldens those who share their ideas to act violently, as we have seen so many times. 

Will punching an individual Nazi stop this? No. What will stop Nazis is determined mass resistance that will use whatever means necessary to stop such a vile, dangerous movement from taking hold. In the meantime, I have zero sympathy for Nazis who get punched, because guess what: given the opportunity, they'll punch a gay person, a person of colour, or political opponent, or worse."
"Let's be real here, they were stopped because they were black.  The guy was tased because the he had the audacity to ask why he was being stopped.  Cops don't want anybody to question them really ever and particularly when they can't give them an answer.  Like in this case they couldn't tell the guy that they stopped him because he was black so they tased him to show him who was boss and then added insult to injury by then charging him with a misdemeanor."
"The truth of the matter is you are calling out the country as a whole for the actions of a few. A few bad cops do not represent the country, just like a few Marines who refuse to recite the pledge don't represent the bulk of our armed forces. Nobody debates a right to protest, but the manner and agenda of the protest is debated.

Further, more african americans are killed by african americans than ANY people are killed by the cops. More cops are putting their lives on the line to serve and protect the african american community than there are cops trying to hurt them. If you deny that, then you are ignorant.

The issues inherent in the african american communities, which is a major cause to the racial profiling and racial related issues, are contributed by the community itself and the choices they make.  The community needs to be supported more (in my opinion), especially financially, but if the community deceides to not embrace the support, it'll never change. That's their choice"

Now when I call my (ex-NBA) bank to get my balance, or my clinic to find out the results of blood tests, or when I call my AK Air credit card folks, they want the last four digits of my social security #. Do you want Kris Kobach and the Russian hackers to have that? He wants this to supposedly prevent voting fraud, but he's  deliberately kept tens of thousands of American citizens from voting. Kobach went to Arizona and North Carolina and Wisconsin, to keep black and brown and poor people, and students and WOMEN from voting. Bernie did get shafted, thanks to the DNC, but I can't imagine that Bernie would want these creatures to have the data they're demanding!"

The officer then performed a public service and shot this pestilence on society.

"""or perhaps a political moment."" the best way of describing the recent happenings in parliament. Mr. Malema's call, again and again, for the nationalisation of banks has become as boring as the EFF's walk outs and bad behaviour in parliament. To nationalise banks would show the lack of understanding that banks do not have a 'money well' that produces money, but that the money belongs to the people of South Africa whether private of business. The moment banks are nationalised and going by the poor governance of SoE's,  the money will be withdrawn and kept under beds and the banks will collapse as will our financial structure.
Malema speaks of no or little progress for black women in banks. Rubbish, most staff in branches, service & main branches are tellers and some have during the course of time been promoted to supervisory/mgt positions. sure they are not all CEO's but there can only be one CEO and most are black, men and women.
 So this is the usual political moment. Sad but true."

"Because they may be the only work in your field or the best paying work in your field that is present.  If a Nazi Skin Head has to hire fairly because of the law for his bank, and he is the only Banker within 20 miles out in the mid-west, the black employees should not have to give up any benefits or be kept from company funded gatherings just because the Nazi owner does not want to pay for blacks to come as a matter of upholding his religious/political beliefs.  People can only find work where work is available & not all work is necessarily available outside of these businesses.  Say like with the only hospital in a town perhaps which happens to be Catholic run. 

Basically, if you are funded in part, by the government, such as a college or hospitals & therefore you must hire non-catholics who are qualified for the jobs you offer in order to keep that tax funded support then you must afford them the same benefits working outside your business offers or choose to give up the funds."

"Wow, President Trump ""fails at everything"". Should I assume you attend UH or better yet, Berkeley? I'm really curious as to what you thought during the previous administration. Would you put Benghazi, Libya, Iraq, ISIS, less than 2% growth rate for 8 consecutive years, the almost doubling of the national debt, the Iran agreement, the prisoner exchange, the IRS, poor economic growth for the Black community, all in the success column? On the other hand, The President has been in office 100 days. Would it be fair to say it's too early to judge his Presidency?"
"Absolutely. Today on the networks Kellyann was falling over herself with her ""interpretations""  of what Donald meant. What happened to actually saying what you mean and not having to have a surrogate spin your comments a few hours after you spew them.  The FOX new crew panel, Outnumbered,  were all trying to convince the audience:Trump was simply providing information to Americans. So once again the president elect took it upon himself to speak for the country.  When in history has a private citizen been given such privilege.

I remember thinking the Creature from the Black Lagoon was what was hidden in the swamp.  I now see the creature as a friendly member of society compared to Trump."
"TWU's coercion of students into signing a covenant to surrender or suspend their freedom to express their sexual orientation and be free from discrimination is, I believe, unlawful. 

Particularly repellent is that, if allowed, what other fundamental freedoms could TWU demand that students surrender? Why stop at rejecting LGBTQ students? Could TWU not claim their religious freedoms include the right to reject Jews, Muslims, Blacks, the 'disabled', foreigners, etc., etc.? If allowed, TWU could (and likely would) decide that their religious freedoms include the right to exclude pretty much any group they don't like. 'Religious rights' must not become a smokescreen for bigotry.  

Individuals have the right to their religious beliefs and to live their lives in accordance with their chosen religion. Those rights, however, are individual, not 'institutional', and cannot be allowed to impede the rights and freedoms of others. There is no 'ranking' of rights and freedoms in our constitution."
"Thanks Mr Caplan for your thoughts as stated in the hundredth article you have published so far this year concerning the future US President. Wouldn't you agree that you may as well be living on Mars for what your opinion is worth?

By the way why didn't you mention that 30% of Latinos and 10% of blacks voted for the new US President?"
"With enthusiastic community support, the city of Eugene fittingly passed a resolution declaring the second Monday of October as Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Why? Because Columbus Day represents the brutal genocidal ethnic cleansing of the Americas.

Yet what was our community's response to University of Oregon's ""Israel block party"" where the brutal genocidal (still ongoing) ethnic cleansing of Palestine was not condemned but celebrated? How can Arab or Muslim or Palestinian students feel safe at our university when UO-affiliated Jewish organizations hold a ""block party"" celebrating the Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine and promote the IDF? What would it take for our community to understand that Palestinians, including refugees, might feel the same way about the flag of Israel that Blacks might feel when they see the Confederate flag or that Jews might feel when they see the Nazi Party flag? Has allegiance to Israel, a country that bans return of refugees it has created, replaced theology?"

"I undestood that most mines are public companies in which shares, which anyone who can afford it can buy, are traded on a daily basis.
Why then do we need to legislate that X% of shares should belong to black people? Maybe they haven't bought shares because they don't want them.
What will happen is the 30% will be snaffled up by the already wealthy black elite who don't seem to be doing much about improving the lot of their less fortunate countrymen, so I'm not sure how this will help the folks in the townships."

""" In fact, the entire “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” protest was based on a lie. Michael Brown did not have his hands up when he was shot in Ferguson, Mo.""

Perhaps, but the final kill shot was straight down through the top of Brown's head, a fact the cop lied about in his testimony to the grand jury. Normally, when a potential suspect lies to the grand jury, there will be charges brought so that the truth can be sorted out in a trial. But the grand jury process in Ferguson was obviously a sham run by the DA, designed to get the cop off the hook. And that is the problem. The PROCESS of justice was denied, so people, especially minorities, can't trust the cops or the entire legal justice system. And that is a condition they were very used to in Ferguson, as evidenced by MANY examples of police targeting blacks there with no repercussions and no justice."
"No. Not at all.

It says that sex belongs in marriage and that it's a gift to the whole marriage, and the gift is far bigger than mere momentary satiation. 

The gift comes from God and shouldn't be ""split"".  It should be received wholly, fully, completely, lovingly, trustingly - as a couple - a unity.  Not as mere individuals to be picked and chosen from. 

My point on diseases is entirely buttressed by diseases in Africa.  Were sex and marriage and children and love and responsibility and sacrifice NOT divided, there would no disease problem in Africa or anywhere else. 

Complementary isn't at all limited to just women...preposterous.  Of course it applies to men, entirely so."
"I don’t need any history lessons from a Progressive.  It would be tantamount to Bible Study from an atheist.  Conservative and Liberal means nothing when compared to Right and Wrong.
Democrats not only were the Party of Slavery in the 19th century but the Party of Jim Crow in the 20th Century.  Republicans passed the first Civil Rights Act under President Eisenhower.  Johnson needed Republican support because he didn’t have enough votes form his majority Democratic Party to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  None of these Civil Rights Laws would have been necessary except for Democrats obstructing the rights of Black Americans (Jim Crow Laws). 

Blaming the ACA on the Republicans is a lie. Just because Nixon, Romney and a Republican think-tank floated similar ideas around, the fact is, it needed to be passed into law. The majority Democrat Party forced it down America’s throat without one Republican vote.

"Been said in other comments, I disagree with Kiszla, he's got the bullpen wrong, the reason they have been hammered lately is becuase they are worn out. Said it weeks ago, starting pitching was not going into the 7th and 8th inning, Black was pulling in 5th and 6th.  NO bullpen can last the marathon season pitching this many innings. Starters need to go deeper. They need a stater that can give them 7-8 innings. Trade for a starter - Sonny Gray, Ervin Santana.  I would look to the AL pitcher who is available like Chris Archer. This 9th inning comebacks because bullpen has blown lead is not sustainable."
"The point is to encourage everyone in school, and let their talent play out.

"(Part two of three)  As Isaiah 26:4-6 puts it, “Trust in the LORD forever!” as distinct from church hierarchs “For the LORD is an eternal Rock.  He humbles those in high places, and the lofty city he brings down; He tumbles it to the ground, level it with the dust.  It is trampled underfoot by the needy” particularly those who are denied Obama Care by the RCC insisting on denying artificial means of birth control to those unconvinced by their natural law arguments  “by the footsteps of the poor” who will get butchered by abortion attempts when denied hospital care.  In all of this business with natural law, “Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord” and that is not necessarily the local cleric   “it is better to take refuge in the LORD than to trust in man."
"Oh I'll definitely give you 2010, SD were one of the best teams in the league until Sept and then dogged it... but Black deserves at least as much credit for the first five months as he does blame for the last one.

<<You refer to a bill that the court issued an injunction against prior to the election. So that is a non-starter - the law was not in operation.>>

The GOP continued to scheme to suppress the black vote...and bragged about it. That, too, made big news. You must have missed it along with the every other one of the innumerable stories about the shenanigans in North Carolina. Remarkable.

<<Changing early voter abilities and long lines does not spell ""suppression"" to me.>>

"I don't think it's far fetched to believe homosexuality could be a choice for some. People associate with groups for a variety of reasons. For example we just saw in the news a woman who passed herself off as being African American because she related more to that community. Inmates in prison may engage in homosexual behavior while incarcerated then revert back to heterosexual relationships once released. Transgender choose which group they feel more aligned with. 
Policy wise it makes little difference. My point is biology and nurture provide billions of variations. It's no harm to me what gender someone aligns to or how they got there.
If you accept diversity then accept diversity. An individual's spiritual beliefs are another part of diversity. Cliche's rarely hold true. There are people who believe homosexuality is a sin and still do not believe in the persecution of Gay people. Accepting diversity does not mean you have to agree with the behavior."

"I have no reservations in opposing your attempts to control those who are addicted merely because you are offended by them and their habit.  Eugenics is precisely the same thing.

She and W.E.B Dubois 'worried' that the Negroes would view it as genocide, but they proceeded anyway because keeping these women from getting pregnant was 'for their own good'.  Your tobacco plan is also 'for their own good' although it is also because you are offended.  Anytime I see someone coming towards me to do something  'for my own good', I will react with any 2nd Amendment tool I can find.

"Obviously, as a noted scholar of the Holocaust, Dr. Marrus could not be a racist, so it is appropriate that the College did not sever ties with him. However, his failure to understand that these days certain things are not fit subjects for levity is still regrettable; but incidents like this, even without major measures being taken in response, will no doubt lead to greater public awareness of this within the affected community.

People don't get away with joking about the Holocaust these days, and no one should really be surprised that black people have feelings about the era of slavery too. Just as some of our sports teams are considering changing their names, now that (apparently) we've discovered that people of First Nations origin actually still exist and have feelings too.

There are times when I do feel that political correctness is taken to excess, but it's not excessive that we're simply realizing that respect is for all groups, not just those we're used to."
"It is ALL right here in the title.

"Not much to celebrate right now but the Futuee under Trump has to be better.
It cant get any worse than it has been under Obama.
Economically, the blacks have not benefited very much from Obama's $10 rrillion deficit.
Most of that went to his Wall Street handlers.

Even at that, Obama had the slowest  economic growth rate of any modern President, even tho he started when the US economy was at a low level.

In addition, his term ended when the homicide rate of blacks in the US were reaching a modern high.

And of course history will treat Obama as one of the most warlike Presidents in modern history while joining forces with Al Quaeda and ISIS in Syria, resulting in millions of refugees and thousands killed, while stimulating a bran of terrorism that has destabilized Europe and caused America to close its borders for security matters.

So, its been a tuff for the past 8 years, so lets hope that Trump can turn the US economy around with lower taxes and more attention to the common man.."

"I suggest that you visit the 13 million people living in the shanty-towns in metropolitan area of Buenos Aires, telling them that.  Bergoglio, traveled to and from the cathedral in Buenos Aires on an E-line train covered with graffiti.  He wore clerical black, and nobody on the train recognized him, because he appeared infrequently on TV and he avoided official receptions.

From the time he became auxiliary bishop, 1992, to become primate of Argentine, he submerged himself in the daily flux of humanity on public transportation, using the subway and the urban bus network.  He talked to the people riding with him, even listening to their confessions, if they asked him.  He was among the poor, common folk of the shanty-towns.

His home was in Villa Ramon Carrillo--the whole area was nick-named Villa miserias.  No single curial prelate, no cardinal president, or even a bishop within the Catholic church ever lived or traveled in poverty, with people submerged in poverty as Francis did."

"After voting for the Democratic Party for 28 years, I walked away from the party for the GOOD of the American public. Unless and until the Democratic Party returns to its roots as the party for the working class, it will not serve the American public well.

And, no one in their right mind blames Sanders for Clinton's election loss. She was a poor candidate. The DNC was warned of that fact even as it rigged the primary in her favor with its limited debates, Super Delegates (who made a decision even before Clinton had a challenger) and use reporters sympathetic to Clinton to tar Sanders. Clinton lost because she lost the Rust Belt, which hated her trade policies.

Sanders is very popular with black youth, who will influence their elders in 2020 after having been correct about Clinton in 2016.

You and others in the party should realize that many former Democrats will no longer vote for anymore centrist neoliberals the elite put up, no matter their gender or race. Lesser evilism is over."

"Just to follow up.....

""The younger generation will never fully realize the risk we ran, and the sacrifices we made to free our beloved Southland from the hated rule of the “Carpetbagger,” the worse negro [sic.] and the home Yankee. Thank God, our work was rewarded by complete success. After the order grew to large numbers, we found it was necessary to have someone of large experience to command. We chose General N. B. Forrest, who had joined our number. He was made a member and took the oath in the Room No. 10 of the Maxwell House at Nashville, Tennessee, in the fall of 1866, nearly a year after we organized at Pulaski. The oath was administered to him by Captain John W. Morton, afterwards Secretary of State, Nashville, Tennessee.[9]""

In this case the term carpetbagger means war profiteer. So I can see why the KKK and south were against them, but to make it seem like the KKK was anti-carpetbagger and not racist is just dumb."

"Exposure to illnesses as a part of 'exploring' and or conquering territory is far from limited to North America.  Or perhaps you forgot about little epidemics like the black death (introduced into Europe from Asia).  You also seem to have forgotten about some of the mini epidemics that broke out in various ports throughout Europe after early expeditions to the Americas returned.  Finally you incorrectly put FAR too much weight on reports some morons tried to get natives sick by giving them 'infected' blankets.  1.  Simple greed is a much easier explanation and 2 the infections they were attempting to spread didn't spread that way and it was known that they didn't spread that way at the time. That kind of nonsense is like saying gay men were trying to spread HIV by holding hands.

As for the treaties, you must not follow history very closely.  The treaties with various tribes were all horribly flawed in multiple ways.

"Hillary Clinton is still ahead in the polls.  Trump is ahead in only one state, Georgia.  Trump's past rhetoric has turned off just about all Hispanics, Blacks, and Muslims.  The blue cop vote and veteran's vote are not enough to win.  Cruz is smart to not endorse Trump.  Trump is going to lose."
"With minimum mandatory sentences and DAs who are looking to up their conviction rates, the DA adds ""with intent to distribute"" to the charges against the black man.  After all, if he wasn't guilty, why would he run? Now faced with serious charges and extensive jail time, the DA offers a plea deal which will result in a drastically reduced sentence.  What a guy.
The black man takes the plea because he can't afford a high-profile lawyer who either knows the judge or the DA and he knows that a black man would never be given the benefit of the doubt in a trial.  After all, blacks commit a disproportionate number of crimes...
Now he is just one more statistic proving that to be ""true."""

"Actually no, they wrong color and they have no family here-maybe. Three unknowns going into a brown skin prison. Tony Williams found out the hard way, the guy that killed officer Troy Barboza. His best friend squealed on him cause his best friend realized two black guys in prison full of brown guys means you loose every night. Instead his best friend went into Witness Protection. I hated every moment protecting that guy. but I also learned a lot from him. Racism is part of how you survive in prison."
"""Ruling by Brazil’s top court potentially undercuts Temer investigation"" - good read is the Brazil government report on ""People's Republic of China"" and the visits of Temer et al over the years, and the complementary visits of Supreme Cout Justices to and from China in 2009. Then there is the submarine cable being built directly to Spain.. 'to avoid US spying'.

Why IS it that Olympics often come before a total meltdown.. Greece, Brazil, potentially Alberta? Well.. Greece and Spain (Italy), with nowhere else to turn, have been pushed into the arms of China  by the EU.. though gotta hand it to the EU for their foresight in installing WIFI on the islands of Greece in 2014 while pensioners were committing suicide from austerity.

BRICS, AIIB, $billions in loans from China, more Asians in Rio than blacks.. isn't it weird how that one word China can be associated with just about any case of corruption?"
"By every measurable metric (salary, education, net worth, employment, crime, home ownership, etc) the black community LOST standing and /or ground during Obamas 8 years in office, now they're going UP under President Trumps first 9 months!

Yeah, there's alot of ""Not a good sign(s)"" Starting with people who think the military somehow owns the flag instead of seeing it as a nations flag. These same people have never served ""My Dad was in Nam!"" ""My brother is in Afghanistan"" doesn't count as ""served"", yet that's an argument I've heard more than once. It's the 'ol ""I have a black friend"" so I'm not racist card. Second verse same as the first. They don't understand brother. They've never even read the Constitution or know what the flag actually represents as they use it for a prop. Trying desperately to find someone, preferably black, in uniform to drape the flag across their shoulders and stand behind Drumpf at the rally"
"Allow me to blow your 'history lesson' right out of the water.  All of the slaves were not black and a good many never were within 1000 miles of Africa.  

The reality is those who are 'black' are given every possible government advantage while those born into similarly dismal backgrounds are not and that is flat racist discrimination.  And unsurprisingly it is again the party of discrimination selling it as roses rather than the turd it is."

Socialist-leaning policies don't work, have never worked, and divert resources away from actions that stand a much better chance of actually doing anything productive.

Look at the Natives here. Who can honestly say the gov't has done a good job with them? Black people in the US, as a demographic, have actually seen their economics standings and quality of life decrease from the time of WW2, directly correlating with the rise in social programs that were designed to assist them."
Havent seen the media address the real issues in the recent months. It is all about propaganda and how to show the black community in a bad light.

I also believe Hillary was involved in child trafficking in Haiti. At least that is what has come out in the wikileaks in the last couple of days.  I encourage people to do their own research on this and look directly at the source.  ADN is irresponsible for not reporting on this information."
"Reply to: ""just as good as you""  - If you are talking about picking cotton in the fields in the Southern U.S., then slaves were indeed the main source of ""free"" labour for that effort until the U.S. civil war. Of course, the slaves were given food, shelter, and clothing for their survival so the labour wasn't really ""free"", it was ""unpaid"".  Most of the ""industry"" in the U.S. was located in the Northern States.  Mass migration of Black people from the South to the Northern States took place between 1910 and 1970, and has slightly reversed since that time."
Racism does not have a degree.  Is he 5% racist or 25%? Maybe he's 62% racist.  He likes black people but not their hearts. What degree would that be?
"Black Lives Matter works against racist policing practices that lead to black folks being the victims of a disproportionate number of police shootings and killings.

The epidemic of violence in black communities is a symptom of the systemic racism in the USA, and also of the refusal of conservative politicians to do anything sensible about  gun violence."
"In one sense, at least, the ANC regime substantially outperformed the Nats - the killing of predominantly Black people. Given the Nats' 67 Sharpeville ""scorecard"", the ANC's 115 (Esidimeni), 34 (Marikana) and the annual slaughter of some 7 000 children under five years of age - mainly rural and mainly Black - by forcing them to use contaminated water borders on latter-day genocide, and is way more ""impressive."" But, hey, the bigger picture means that the ANC saves R25-million or so every year by not having to pay child grants for dead kids."

"I would like to challenge President Obama to find any nation in the world whose history isn't messy. Many nations got history that will make US history looked like Care Bears'!! Its appears that slavery was the worst trait of our nation's history But yet compared to other nations, it can be considered to be mild and short lived. For example, Muslim world have been importing black slaves since the 7th century by the millions. But yet left no real descendants of their slaves. So what happened to those slaves, eh? Just remember folks, every single one of us, regardless of our DNA background, all had people in our past who were masters....and slaves in our bloodline. Even Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain can traced her blood to a tanner's daughter who charmed the Duke of Normandy. A serf!!! Her son became William the Conqueror!!

History of any nation will be full of contradiction, hypocrisy and idiosyncrasy."

These black players are really ungrateful for all we've done for them if you ask me my opinion
"It doesn't take much to bring hate to the surface no matter where you live. I remember the separate unequal hospital wards for Blacks, the separate water fountains, the segregated churches, the unease of living in Virginia & Alabama in the 60's. Unfortunately supposed CHRISTIAN churches have played a role in their teachings and actions of intolerance. I have long supported the Southern Poverty Law Center from which I just received a certificate of appreciation. I do agree that the U.S. Justice system has failed in this area. Right now most Americans are not represented on the US Supreme Court. 5 Justices are Roman Catholic, 22% of population, 3 justices are JEWS, 3% of the population. CHRISTIANS, Muslims, Hindus, Atheists, Buddhas, etc. Americans are not represented on the US Supreme Court. That is tragic."
"Liberals got women the right to vote. Liberals got African Americans the right to vote. Liberals created social security and lifted millions of elderly people out of poverty. Liberals ended segregation. Liberals passed the civil Rights act & the voting rights act. Liberals created medicare. Liberals  passed the clean air act and the clean water act. 

What did conservatives do?!
They opposed every one of those programs... Every One!"
"Civilized men in modern times used to alert their almost adult sons that females can become a special kind of crazy. It became considered a sexist thing to do and fell out of favor along with those all-male clubs. Strangely enough women have always seemed to know that ""other"" women can be a special kind of crazy. Perhaps this is why the story of how the black widow spider kills her mate has such an unusual attraction for us - it hits close to home??"

"Thank you OS for your comment.  Too many times come backs to truth from our group here is painful to experience.  I am as my brother is........  They don't get to me because I grew up w/a racist, woman hater (married 5 x's) and a bigot.  I told him to his face (my dad) that he was all of those things and he denied just like these poor souls do.  It was laughable the last fight we had.  A young African American was in the news because she'd been cut on her face from forehead to chin and he said (matter.of.fact like): she probably deserved it.  That was the last time and I walked away from everyone in my family.  I stand in solidarity w/ all those who are the object of this kind of evil."
He is a Breitbart propagandist and is the main person that is helping Bannon in his campaign to get Pope Francis to resign or at least sidelined because Francis could successfully oppose Bannon's campaign of bigotry and hatred against brown non-Christian people.  More interesting to me about this story is that it was first reported in Lifesite News which is run by Burke's buddies.  It is almost like there is an alliance between Burke and Bannon and their allies on these things.
"For Obama and Rice orange should be the new black. It just shows he couldn't be the best President so he will end up being the most dishonest one. The people spoke in November yes they didn't want you for four more years, he couldn't take that."
"Your argument is a contradiction. 

1. We should force teams to meet certain selection criteria with regards to race.  By example the team must contain X number of race Y. The team must not be selected on merit alone. 
    
then you argue 
2. No players of race Y are picked on the basis of being race Y, they are there on merit. 

These statements are mutually exclusive, if 2 is true then 1 is unnecessary. If 1 is true then to argue 2 is absurd. 

So are you saying we should enforce a unnecessary rule on society or are you comfortable with living in your own absurd reality?

No one is saying putting don't put black people in the team. The argument is whether teams should be forced to pick black players in order to meet a percentage."
"Sure...because cops goto work thinking ""I'm gonna shoot a black person today. Mark my words"" 

His hands went up THEN HE WALKED AWAY AND REACHED INTO A CAR. He created the situation by doing this. He fueled tension and adrenaline, once he was hit with that tazer the female cop flinched...so, I ask again...why was NOT compliant and walking away? Why reach in the car? Who cares what the helicopter guy said, he didnt force the suspect to be non compliant."
"What a sad piece of propaganda.  All americans regardless of race or creed have the ability to recognize right from wrong and vote accordingly. Mr. Trump will do well with all Americans.   If you want to look at the blacks, most would agree that eight years of Obama has done nothing for them and there is every reason to believe that Hillary will do even less.  Trump will drain the swamp in Washington. The Clintons will both be facing criminal charges and will leave a blight on this republic's history forever."
"Yup, wipe the chess board clean. The Bolsheviks did, Mao zedong did, Hitler tried, so did Pol Pot. You start by deleting your history.

Boots is right, supremacists are terrorists, so is black lives matter( a point of view from the other side )."

"You wrote the other day that the march was populated by people who were just curious. 
As to the hypocrisy of the call for inclusion while calling it a ""Women's March,""  the title of the march did not imply that only women could march. There were men there because they also were marching FOR the equal treatment of women.
As to protesting Trump's actions, the marchers had many signs noting Trump's actions in his speech about grabbing women. He has also said women who get an abortion should be punished. Yes, some signs were crude. But just as so many have excused Trump, who among us has not said something we later regretted?
Considering the marchers were a bunch of ""liberal women"" (and curiosity seekers, as you said before) it is ""funny"" (using the passive aggressive sarcastic term) that you seem to put so much effort in discrediting that 7,000 PEOPLE marched on a cold rainy day to air their grievances. Only 7,000? My 83 year-old mother hoped to march, but infirmity kept her home. 7001?"
"Highly unequal. Like so many things in South Africa: income, opportunity, schooling, health, policing, land ownership... ect. While you can label BEE all you like the simple fact is that the constitution allows this prejudice to correct the system, to make it more equal, and it is indeed an irony but perhaps predictable that it takes this guise. It is however a prejudice that many argue is absolutely necessary and so far has been conducted by governmental discretion.

Attacks on this mechanism that claim it is based on race and hence wrong fail because that is not the premise; there was literal harm done to millions of South Africans that irrespective of their skin colour needs to be redressed.  The fact that they were black, has made it easier to regulate, but in essence is not necessary.  Rationality and cost effectiveness are still requirements though. 

 While I strongly believe that race is a fiction with no basis in reality, racism was/is unfortunately very much a reality."
"For a city that's so liberal, you'd think they'd care more about how few black people live there (less than 1%).  Sure flies in the face of that ""inclusive"" thing that liberals always push on the rest of us."
"I like Ms. Patkotak's articles as a rule, and I am politically sympathetic with her, but I am older, also. There was nuclear grandstanding, there was the development of MIRV nukes, neutron bombs, of course there was the Cuban missile crisis. As Vietnam heated up there was the international image of a Buddhist monk setting himself on fire, of a young Vietnamese girl running from napalm with all her clothes burned off. On the terrorism front there was the red army faction shooting up airports, the PLO and Black September movement blowing up planes, attacking cruise ships, and killing Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics. Oh, we had a lot of fun in the 60s, 70s, and 80s.
There may well be LESS violence now than in days of yore. The difference being that courtesy of the internet and sites such as youtube we have no time delay and no distance from events that occur anywhere on the planet. We have more exposure and less sense of proportion.
As time goes by we will learn to parse the news."
"Trudeau, a supposedly enlightened man, says his government has no intention of legalizing any drug besides marijuana.
But faced with thousands of deaths per year, it's apparent that the ethical contortions used to justify the continued prohibition of most illicit drugs are utterly without merit. 
When prohibition has been challenged in court, judges have ruled that government has a ""valid interest in protecting society"" via prohibition.
But when prohibition creates a black market controlled by criminal gangs, and exposes vulnerable addicts to (now massively increased) risk of death via unpredictable product, and considering the associated policing and health expenses... where is this ""protection"", and what is it costing us?
Finally, if drug use is a health issue, as even politicians increasingly suggest, then we should be looking at the health outcomes of drug policy -- and 2500+ deaths in a single year is about the worst policy outcome I can imagine.
End the drug war now."
"In another 25 years hockey will be a dead sport in Canada. Changing demographics Blacks, Chinese, Flipinos, Jews all follow Basketball, people from the Sub-continent of India follow Cricket, Africans, Arabs and South Americans all follow soccer. Old stock British and French very low birth rate.

"“I was astonished that you blamed black people for poor health and poverty because of all the chicken and barbecue they eat,”.  She may not have said these exact words but the inference was there.   Aside from that there really in no reason that this boy should have been kicked out of his troop.  it doesn't matter if the boy was coached or came up with the questions on his own. Apparently the troop leader has a problem with people who don't agree with him politically.  It is really sad that the Boy Scout Council has not come out and said that the leader was wrong.  I guess they will evaluate the situation and come to the conclusion we all expect.  That it is up to the troop leader who is in the troop.  They will make no meaningful resolution."
"So you don't feel that Trump's enemies should stop trying to claim his presidency isn't legitimate. Did you have the same response when the ""Birther Movement"" was questioning Obama's legitimacy?

When you deny the legitimacy of an election (on the eve of the inauguration, no less) you are indicting the whole political process. It was an unworthy tactic when the Republicans used it, and it's no more worthy when the Democrats do the same. 

Your bias against Trump is understandable, but it appears to make you say false things. Trump did not offer a personal or political insult. Nor did Trump say anything about Lewis' record on helping blacks in America. He said only that Lewis should pay more attention to the needs of his own constituency.

If Trump comported himself as you would like to see, he wouldn't be president today."
"The story makes it sound like the older man just, out of the blue, decided to attack the student simply because he was black.  It's possible it played out that way, but I doubt it.  More likely the older man was provoked in some way.  

And no, I'm not defending the actions of the older man.  I'm simply saying there was probably more going on than the article would indicate."
Never happen.  Why?  Minorities will scream to high heaven about not having the Congressional Black/Hispanic Caucus.  America is too divided for objective redistricting to work
"You over look in your praise of LBJ his obviously true feelings ie; this quote ""These Negroes, they're getting pretty uppity these days and that's a problem for us since they've got something now they never had before, the political pull to back up their uppityness. Now we've got to do something about this, we've got to give them a little something, just enough to quiet them down, not enough to make a difference. For if we don't move at all, then their allies will line up against us and there'll be no way of stopping them, we'll lose the filibuster and there'll be no way of putting a brake on all sorts of wild legislation. It'll be Reconstruction all over again."""
"If Mr. Kaepernick and Mr.Pitts are truly sincere about their protest they have to advocate for the complete destruction and renaming of the Democratic Party. It has been the Democratic Party that had their collective foot on minorities and the people of color in the United States. It was the Democratic Party founded by Democrat Andrew Jackson who owned the 300 slave Heritage Plantation and the Tennessee Iron Works which picked up men in the south on vagrancy charges and marched them into mines at gunpoint. It was the Democratic Party and Andrew Jackson again who initiated the Indian Trail of Tears expulsion. It was the Democratic Party who fought for slavery in the Civil War, It was the Democratic Party which created the KKK, keeping African Americans in bondage with Jim Crow policies for 100 years. It was the Democratic Party that ushered minorities into barrios, ghettos and projects showing up only on election time to steal votes, pander and use the race card when threatened..."
Do you think that god might of had it right and man in his greed messed it up. In the beginning and shortly after races were contained in their areas and maybe that's the way it was meant to be. Part of the problem in America is the importation of large numbers of people from Africa to do the work for slave owners and the classification started then. Had time passed and people from Africa come to this country like everyone else over time I doubt there would the problem in the proportion that exists. Had Mexico not been influenced but the Catholic religion their population wouldn't have exceeded their ability to feed them. Had the American Indians had a better immigration policy they wouldn't have been overrun so soon. So we have the problems of today and it won't end but much has been done to help. Watching the Olympics and the contributions and the smiles and the manners of all of the athletes gives hope that man can straighten out the wrongs that he caused and there be peace.
"cont. My 1st human services job for pay was as a vocational counselor at a non-profit in East Cleveland. More than 90% of our clients were black. I came to Eugene in 1975 to complete my B.S. at the UO. A cop stopped me within 30 minutes of landing at the airport. Back then EPD kept a photo book of all black men that stayed in town for more than a week. When the UO found out that I didn't want to play football, I couldn't see an academic advisor until I got to grad school. I am president emeritus of the Eugene Springfield branch of the Eugene Springfield NAACP. I helped the 1st black cop to become to become a detective at EPD.  I'm a founding board member of WellSpring Friends School to help kids that didn't fit in at 4J. I'm the 1st black man to successfully sue EPD for false arrest. They mistook my 15 year old ward and his friend for a 30 year old Mexican bank robber. I'm the only black person to be a manager in the 100 year history of EWEB."
"Ya, Ben Carson is our token black representative of the success of personal effort in a bad environment.   It used to be Bill Cosby.

But I know you better than that Motley, that more a tease, you have had many friendly relationship with black Americans.    

Do you know the biblical story of the seed planted in good soil and bad?    

So you tell me, who had the better chance to of success, a child born into poverty, or child born into financial stability?

So the answer, and you know this, it's the child that is born to better opportunities provided by income that exceeds basic needs.

 Of course a poor child can succeed and a wealthy child fail, but I only as about the chance,(odds) of succeeding.

"On the face of it, many of the organizations that seek to “ expand women's understanding of their available choices” are dominated by college-educated professionals whose screed involves exterminating the offspring of those they purport to help. Planned Parenthood is a perfect example of this dynamic, from its founder Margaret Sanger to today.

As a result they are all too often fonts of misinformation, engaging in predatory and duplicitous practices.

In particular they completely fail to advocate for increasing the size of the pie by actually creating opportunities for women to live full and rewarding lives and focus on reducing the number of slices of the existing pie by reducing the birth rates of minorities.

That was brought in the recent election to the losing candidate’s attention in an open letter by a group of prominent black church leaders."
"We will see, but I tend to agree.  What Trump is covering up is his business contacts in Russia that are likely in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which his kids could go to jail for.  It is up to the Special Counsel to prove it.  

Hillary sprung her own trap by not making Booker VP (yes he is neo-lib, but not more than Hillary and would not alienate any Bernie Bots who are not already lost) to edge the black vote in the four key states she lost and by not immediately attacking Trump when he brought up partial birth abortion, which is already banned under the U.S. Code (she could even promise to support it, she would not have lost any female voters), and by showing how much the pro-life cause is an electoral exercise, not a movement to really do anything for the unborn.  She would have then got the same percentage of the Catholic vote as Obama and would have won."

Sad stories, sad lives.  Many of the homeless are the walking dead."
"They and the Left ""Talk"" a lot, But provide no tangible evidence of systematic institutionalized racism in this country.

Are you aware that ""Hands Up Don't Shoot"" never happened in Ferguson? I'll bet not a single one of these players are. See...some of us actually pay attention to the facts. Darren Wilson was acquitted in a grand jury by black people who witnessed what happened. Michael Brown assaulted Wilson in his vehicle, grabbing at his gun causing it to discharged in the vehicle. When Brown pulled back and tried to flee, Wilson drew is weapon and told him to stop and submit to arrest. Brown turned, then taunted Wilson saying, ""what are you gong to do shoot me?""...then bull rushed Wilson with his head slightly down...That's why brown had gunshots in to the top of his head and shoulders. Wilson had no choice and brown did not stop and go down until he was shot multiple times.

What these players are supporting is black people doing what they want and cops do nothing."
Why is adn not calling it what it is. A BLM MARCH IS STARTING AT SHILOH BAPTIST CHURCH. NICE WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO COME TOGETHER BY HOSTING A TERRORIST GANG THAT ARE KILLING POLICE OFFICERS DAILY IN OUR WORLD NOT TO MENTION THE INNOCENT CHILDREN.

"I did not say we, as a nation, had accomplished the goal of equal opportunity. I said we should assure it to the greatest extent possible. It's a work in progress! You have to admit, we've made progress. If the opposite were true, as you state, we'd have black people still enslaved today. That would really be outrageous and something for which we would not stand. I'll admit, though, we still have much to do in the way of equality and bias.
Moving forward, as I used it, means we cannot allow the mistakes of the past and whatever guilt they may produce, to impede our progress in attaining the goal of equal opportunity."
It takes smarts to run a trucking company.  One of the most difficult jobs around both keeping them on the road and the books in the black.   Trump would have a hard time trying to figure out which tire blew on an 18 wheeler when all are flat.
"Well if you would rather have Walt ""I didn't want Jonny to take the loss"" Weiss trying to squeeze enough wins out of this pitching staff to make the postseason, more power to you. I'm not enamored with everything Bud Black does, especially his lineup choices. But I'll take Black with half his brain tied behind his back over another season of Walt Weiss."
"I actually like his music, and not against him being Gay, but it's like majority of those in the entertainment industry.........he didn't want to come out early in his career because the bottom line was ""MONEY!""  He didn't want to be black balled or labeled."
"Thanks for the info. With nothing else to go on, I would agree that what they did was to be condemned. Still, it is an isolated incident.

Wouldn't it be fair, though, to say that ""some"" who were interviewed found it amusing? Can it be stated as objective fact that they all felt the same way? And is it not also possible that some who found a dramatic representation of an assassination amusing wouldn't necessarily feel the same way about a real one? (After all, there is a difference between bad taste and psychopathology.)

This is how overblown generalizations get started -- ""All conservatives are bigots,"" ""All poor people are lazy,"" ""All cops hate African Americans and vice versa."" I just don't find such judgments helpful."
"You do realize that it was LIBERAL leaders that started and continued the war?   That being considered, it is amazing how much respect the left gives a womanizer and the war monger that replaced him.   As far as respecting law enforcement.  I have nothing but respect for the majority.   It is a tough job, not made any easier by many that are complaining.  The people of color get the kind of law enforcement they deserve.  Remember it is a circle they help perpetuate.   Blacks riot and attack cops and others, cops crack down, which brings more rebellion from blacks, which brings further crack downs. and so on.      Do not think the people of color are so innocent in all of this."
"When he's ""on"", he might be the best pitcher on the team.  But the guy cannot handle pressure.  In a game that counts, especially a sudden death one, I'd hope Black would pull him with 2 guys on base and no outs.  He's not going to pitch out of that.  (This assumes it's still undecided)."
"No, Charles, it's about treating other people with respect and decency. Coulter acted like a whining five-year old with a massive sense of entitlement. Good for Delta to not be black-mailed by her childish ranting."
"I admit, I could be wrong, he may not have been an immigrant. In my city, there are a large number of Hispanic immigrants. They dress similar and groom similar and drive similar dilapidated vehicles. They gather at home depot parking lots waiting for job opportunities. If you think I am a racist by such statements you are wrong - it is simply an observation.

(I very much admire people who work hard in spite of tough living conditions)

Many here, have had a knee-jerk PC reaction and have already labeled me a hateful racist! Ha!
That would explain why most of my friends, since kindergarten where either black or Hispanic!!

 In pointing out my possible error in judgment - they have all judged me in error - with much animosity and condescension I might add, - which I never intended for the possible 'immigrant' driver who sped past the school children getting off the bus.

In JUDGING ME - you miss my original point - the importance of knowing the language and laws of the place you live."
"From the tone of the above opinion, it is clear that the civility and such proposed is of the liberal kind.  Teaching civility, tolerance, and respect is fine if it is universal, but the one-sided examples given demonstrate that true civility, tolerance, and respect is not what they have in mind.  Instead of citing anecdotal incidents from the SPLC, the speakers could have used the example of how a UO law professor was crucified for wearing black make up in her own home with no intention of hurting anyone.  But no, the UO-related authors cite Trump and Trump things.  They are hypocrites in my view.  Anyone serious about tolerance, civility, and respect looks to their own failures before focusing on those of others.  Tolerance is not a one-way street.  Tolerance does not only apply to things one agrees with.  When pleas for civility call for universal tolerance, they will have meaning.  Until then, fake news."
"No, I respectfully believe your mistaken in that broad generalization respectfully MY TAKE, many people believe in God of all political persuasions crossing all racial and sexual orientations. The church has long been the bedrock in the Black communities, especially in the Civil Rights era, people of all political parties share a belief in God, and there are many churches with Gay ministers and parishioners today some doing gay marriages in their belief in God as well, even with regard to Biblical admonitions against such. 



As far as the personal insult MY TAKE, I don't give rise to such when issued, nor respond in kind,  never have. I think they reflect more on the author who employs such when in the public forums of discussion, so I refrain from doing so. But you welcome to do so all the same in the vain of uncensored speech, which I firmly believe in. 


Have a great day respectfully!"
"Then there was the matter of physical space, with Obama lying again that he was going to close Guantanamo, while reality, he authorized the Expansion from One (1) Camp, to Six (6) Camps plus a $100 Thousand Soccer Field for Use by Detainees Only.

Obama doing the Political Favor thing, proposed that a closed Illinois (his real Home State) Super Max at the U.S. be used to Imprison Terrorists.  U.S. Department of Justice stepped in immediately and informed Democrat President Obama that as soon as the Terrorist set foot in the U.S. they must be afford U.S. Constitutional Rights, this is why those sent to Guantanamo or other ""Black Sites"" never physically set foot at the U.S..

Before any of you get all Democrat on me, go read the U.S. Laws signed by Democrat Obama, January 22, 2009, 2014, 2015, till recent before Trump.   I am talking about U.S. Laws, not Democrat Non Factual Opinions."
"I was a freshman at Texas Western College (now UTEP) in 1965-66 back when the basketball team won the NCAA championship, the football team went to a bowl game, and the track team was one of the best in the nation.  I don't recall ever seeing any of the athletes anywhere on campus.

The following summer, I was in New Orleans walking on Bourbon Street, when three young black guys walking toward me stopped, looked at my TWC shirt, looked at me, and one of them said, ""YOU went to Texas Western??? Man, I thought that was a colored school!""  The athletes were almost the only black people in the school."
"C'mon Kurt, are you kidding us, right now?

""*Fire all your guns at once*""...and explode into space"" : anyone who's listened to *'Born to be Wild*' more than once since 1968 will tell you that the ""Guns"" they're talking about are rockets- not actual firearms.

And let's use some perspective, shall we?

Steppenwolf and *'The Pusher'* have been around since the 60's.  It's been emulated and covered by hundreds of other bands.  It's classic rock which at and through time have not incited a single mass riot, looting, and killing of police officers.  Any historian or someone over the age of 45 will tell you that in no way does drug use in the 60's equate in scope, depth, breadth, or magnitude to what it does in today's culture-- specifically in today's black rap culture.

To even compare these two things is like comparing, well, 'Starbuk' to Steppenwolf."
"I think everyone's sexuality should stay in the closet! What kind of society judges others based upon sexual preference or defines themselves by their sexual preference? Why not simply give others personal privacy; this country seems obsessed with gay, gay rights, transgender issues, who's gay, what's gay, shake a person's hand and they introduce themselves by sexual preference, ""hi, I'm John and I'm gay."" Honestly, besides the rare hater ignorantly wandering about, who cares? The ignorant haters will find anything they can to hate, any part of a person weather gender, nationality, sexual preference, religion it doesn't matter but the whole gay thing is becoming a circus! This gentleman sounds like he was mistreated and that's a shame but the result may have been the same if he was Jewish, a black man or a woman."
"I think Schill should be put on academic leave for allowing a lynch-mob mentality at my university, I see an example of implicit racism in this whole episode.  There is nothing wrong with being black nor should there be anything wrong with emulating a black person."
"Hmmm...well, if Europeans happened to have darker skin than Africans - by your reasoning Africa would have colonised and oppressed Europe. Nothing to do with the colour of ones skin, but rather the colour of ones thinking. Europeans arrived in Africa and were met by other humans who had no means to resist Europeans with advanced warfare and greed for resources. 
The colour of Mngxitama's thinking is the pitch black of evil and nothingness."
"The GOP wish for the days when they had a half black man in office and could tell Bubba 24/7 all the great things they will do and keep them in fear.  In the end, Bubba won't care about campaign promises as long as Trump sends out diversions like Clinton getting hit by a golf ball."
What these punks really want is for nobody to be arrested for anything. Its the code translation for racial profiling. Soon obobba will issue a decree that no blacks be arrested for any reason. Fact
"Sad that the writer's identity politics filter makes the award a victory for blacks and gays rather than well-earned recognition for a really good film. Let's hope that race wasn't a factor in the judges' selection. That would reduce its value. Only racists believe merit has anything to do with race.

As for being “the only profession that celebrates what it means to live a life,” get over yourselves!"
"also Roger the dodger the NFL commissioner should be fired, when the Dallas Cowboys wanted to wear a sticker on there helmets in honor of the Dallas police officers who got ambushed and killed by a black man in Dallas Rodger said you cannot wear those stickers because it breaks the NFL rules or when a player wanted to wear shoes that honored the 9/11 victims could not do that either so now he says its alright for these felon bums to take a knee to spit on our flag and country, time for the hypocrite American hater roger to step down as commissioner of the National Felon League."

"Get off your high horse, Stevenson and do a little research, please.  Have a look at this story. Trump was an adult when he and his father were cited for discrimination.

From the NY Times story of Aug. 27 (and don't try any bs about the ""lying media"", please - this is a real fact not an ""alternative"" one).

""Over the next decade, as Donald J. Trump assumed an increasingly prominent role in the business, the company’s practice of turning away potential black tenants was painstakingly documented by activists and organizations that viewed equal housing as the next frontier in the civil rights struggle.

The Justice Department undertook its own investigation and, in 1973, sued Trump Management for discriminating against blacks. Both Fred Trump, the company’s chairman, and Donald Trump, its president, were named as defendants. It was front-page news, and for Donald, amounted to his debut in the public eye.""

Waiting for your apology, ha, ha, ha."
"The racial divide is prevalent and always will be in this country. We encourage it with the likes of Black Lives Matter, Black Talent Awards, Black History Month, etc. Elections results are reported by race. Have you ever been to an inner city. Fact is Blacks strain the social service system. Sadly, these are facts folks, let's admit it."
Did she get hired with affirmative action?   Was the univerity low on its quota of angry black women?
"Aloha Frank.  You are entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts.  Donald Drumpf won 8% of the black vote. Romney won 6%.  McCain won 4% (no surprise with those 2 since they were running against a black man).  Bush 2004 won 11%.  Bush 2000 won 9%.  Drumpf won 29% of the Latino vote. Romney 27%. McCain 31%.  Bush 2004 44%.  Bush 2000 35%.  Drumpf won 29% of the Asian vote. Romney won 26%.  McCain won 35%. Bush 2004 won 43%.  Bush 2000 won 41%.  Drumpf won 42% of the women's vote.  Romney won 44%.  McCain won  43%.  Bush 2004 won 48%.  Bush 2000 won 44%.  Highest women's and minority turnouts for a Republican since Reagan?  What on earth are you talking about?"
"Mmusi Maimane is a very funny man. Always quick to point out the log in other people's eyes instead of fixing the racism problem in the DA. Anywhere in the world, if you are the child of a president life goes easy for you, same applies to attractive men and women, people are nicer to people like that. The allegations have not yet been proved, they are uncontested. This lackey who has turned his back on black people is a serious stumbling stone to full on economic freedom for black people. To quote Zuma, you will never have those metros."

"Black lives matter activist here in Hawaii of all places?  I guess that kind of defense strategy is everywhere now.  When you are caught and about to go down for a crime, just scream that it is ""black"" thing and play the race card like Johnny Cochran did for OJ.

Blacks only comprise 12.6 % of the US population......why is it they demand/command such a high % of the agenda??
"We need a research into the correlation of  how drug and gun crime, violence and civil disorder among Blacks, especially young black people are perceived by the rest of society.  What are the experiences of Asians, school teachers, shop owners, mall shoppers and other minorities vis a vis the black population? That would be the Yin to this study's Yang.   Hold that  mirror held up to them as it is persistently held to us."
"Who is going to do this 'monitoring'?  

People wearing brown shirts and swastika armbands?

Are there laws that permit me to 'monitor' you if you are just a black man who has had a fight with his girlfriend a month ago?"
yes they can be sued along with George Soros who gave millions of dollars to this black lives matter group.
"He walked away from the police to his car and dropped his right hand to waist level when he reached the door.

No person trained in use of force is going to let someone who is not complying with police orders to potentially access a weapon in a vehicle or on their person. 

The shooting itself may or may not be justified by the totality of the circumstances but it is a deliberate and incindiary misrepresentation of the video evidence to claim he was ""surrendering"" or ""compliant"" or ""just being black."""
"So April Ryan, was blacks being slave owners during the same period wrong? Or how about African tribes warring with each other and selling the losers of the battles into slavery wrong? Or the continued slavery still taking place in Africa, the Middle East or certain Pacific Asian countries wrong?... *crickets chirping *...."
"No one killed the Jews either....those in charge had instead determined that the Jews weren't fully humans.

Or the black slaves...they were only 3/5ths of a person.

When one is faced with a moral dilemma, just let one's intellect be co-opted. Get it to ""re-classify"" the thorny problem away.  The intellect's job is to classify and name things.  Easy peasy. 

That's what is so good about emotions...just let them get into the driver's seat, and they can make a lot of problems go away, or at least seemingly so.  The sadness returns, and the self-defensiveness and prickliness just grow!"
"Nothing.

He is proposing nothing.

He knows that he is supposed to talk about racism, but he hasn't quite figured out what that has to do with the legalization of marijuana.

I would think that legalization would benefit the black community, as there would be one less reason for police to target them."
"Betsy DeVos is black??  And shouldn't it be, ""Prince WAS Betsy DeVos' brother?"""
"There is no oppression of blacks here.  Just look around, there are far too many success stories that give the lie to that.  The 'oppression' falsehood is used as an excuse by people who need to blame others for their own shortcomings.  They've constructed the plantation on which they've enslaved themselves.  They're free to leave anytime."
"As soon as someone can figure out how to stop 'people of color' from killing each other in those neighborhoods. there is a chance.

The Hispanic and Black gang bangers have been in control there for too long.

Most of the 'people of color' I worked with and for managed to get away from that environment to the relative meritocracy of the military.  

Lot's of black Generals, Senior NCOs etc.  And lots of poor kids from all over the country of all colors....that's the point.  

I see ""Affirmative action"" as a way to demean someone as a current failure without a crutch.  

Building more section 8 housing has been a failure in the big cities.  Throwing money at the ghettos is about as good as throwing money at Oregon K-12 education."
"You are so right.  But liberals need to be beat for many reasons.  1. You really don't like to talk about Chicago.  And equating it to Hillary is an insult to Chicago.  2. You don't like to talk about Chicago because it exposes in a real way failed liberal policies.  3. Talking about Chicago means having to explain why you aren't racist.  It means having to explain why you are so cavalier about black on black crime.  If I was a liberal, I wouldn't want to talk about Chicago either."
"Americans are just violent people. We came over and slaughtered the Native Americans as we rolled across this great beautiful country. When we had ""harvested"" all the easy resources and hit the Pacific we went across the seas to slaughter people in their home lands, destroying HOMES and Families. We have more weapons, more ""kids"" to enlist, and more desire for war than any other people in the world. Is it any wonder that the citizens of this country mimic their government in finding ""war"" solutions to ""non-war"" problems. As far as specific Black on Black violence they are not only the object of racism (which of course doesn't feel good), but have been shown that firepower wins so why not join in. Most of the rest of this country's citizens have no problem accepting that it is right and ok to cruise the world looking for a reason to fire off the cruise missiles and do violence against fellow human beings."
"It has been HALF A CENTURY since the stupid war on marijuana first started. As it is prosecuted now, it is basically a war on black people and other minorities. It has destroyed millions of black families, kept children in poverty, and led to the corruption of our police forces thru asset forfeiture. Enough already. Just let it go. (And yes, I am a conservative Republican.)"
"In a real twist, all the socialists and left wingers on council voted to back stab the LGBT of Toronto to appease BLM.  Only the few conservatives on council who  actually spoke out about the injustice and voted to protect the rights of all people which includes the gay community.

"Actually you did make me look, and I hadn't made any mistake as you'd claimed. That was a fairly ignorant thing to do, I believe, on the order of some wall scrawl by a graffiti artist. Surely you can find more useful things to do."
"Right, but the guidelines is based on a logical connection to the required job. An obese person cannot perform the basic job functions. If someone shows me that a trans person cannot, than by all means ban them. But as we have seen, they can. That is why is it more comparable to being black than to being obese. The military is not exempt from our laws, they don't get to illegally discriminant. And we aren't event talking about joining the military, trump is talking about kicking out people already serving."
"Projecting your own biases onto others doesn't make them true. Just because the media echo chamber wants to paint all of Trump's supporters as racists doesn't make it so. Even the leader of the New Black Panthers Quanell X said that Trump is correct about democrats exploiting black voters and doing nothing to actually make their plight any better. And by the way of ""most"" Americans are so alarmed by Trump how is it that he smashed all previous records for voter turnout during the primaries? Oh I know your answer will be that all of the closet racists came out to vote but I hope you're not so naive"
"But so did Ted Kennedy and that former Democratic KKK Senator Robert Byrd and Justice Hugo (Democrat) Black also served for a ""long,long time"" . Doesn't make them qualified or ""fit"" for office but does show an efficient and corrupt political machine backing them...just like Hillary's."
"By making Black Monday about racism, even though the very large majority were demonstrating about violence in general and in farm communities, irrespective of colour, you yourself are part of spreading racism."
"Stephen,

Anita Hill's accusations are a great example of how liberals can be unrestrained in their invention of defamatory stories to lynch the reputations of anyone who dares to defy their idea about how things should be. If hell has no fury like a woman scorned, there is no falsehood that Liberals are unwilling to invent and spread about any Black who dares to not be compliant with them."
"So I'd anticipate there are also statues of loyalists (Tories in ""American"") in Richmond, to celebrate the defeated past?  No, I thought not.

This noble Southern resistance is another Big Lie of US history, just as Germany wallowed in the ""stab in the back"" to wish away their defeated field army after WWI. 

The confederate soldiers toiled and died so that blacks would not have the same rights they enjoyed. It was the plantation/slave owners who manipulated them to their pathetic deaths."
"Yes, this letter writer hits the hypocritical nail on the head.  Regardless of others' opinion of black make-up, its application is a matter of personal choice and a matter of expression which only harms others through their dislike of the idea it represents (to them).  This episode more than any I remember demonstrates the essential hypocrisy of the self-styled liberal compassionate ""good"" people."
"""Yet we tolerate their freedom of speech. Why shouldn't we? Many died to preserve that freedom even though they disagree with their mindless and largely ignorant rants like yours.""

Many veterans claim to have served to protect American rights & freedoms. How does this work?

Do the US Armed Forces function as some sort of giant civil rights organization?

Black people were still riding at the back of the bus after the big WWII victory.

Women were not allowed full voting rights at the end of WWI.

Were US troops sent to Vietnam so that Americans could be free to send letters to the editor?

Is there any case in which the US Armed Forces have been sent to distant lands on a mission to protect freedom of speech?

Is protecting freedom of speech even part of training scenarios?"

"sukiyaki>  I agree, but the real problem is that everybody is overly concerned with Political Correctness (PC).  IMHO the hell with PC, tell it like it is and be man enough to hear and understand it.  Of course, all lives do matter, but as evidenced by what I saw on the St. Louis protests, it doesn't exist.  Blacks are becoming over bearing in their effort to make an issue, but they themselves kill more of each other than any other race.  .The world is going absolutely NUTS over this race BS, and it's about time we all grow up and be tolerant of each other, for we are all AMERICANS!!!!"

Ah...so what 'race' are we talking about here?  We Muslims are probably the most 'racially diverse' group on the planet.  Can't imagine my Syrian/French/African-American/Welsh/English/Fijian grandchildren promoting their 'race' over that of my Syrian/French/Iraqi/Welsh/English nieces and nephews or that of my Costa Rican/Panamanian/Jamaican/English in-laws.  That would be too complicated for even me to figure out...

"Diplomacy without a credible threat of force is of little use in dealing with the DPRK, which is determined to make itself a nuclear power.  The North Koreans have a real fear of attack, which massive yearly US/ROK military exercises offshore do nothing to ease.  They are not gathering weapons in order to trade them away, but rather as a means to security.  The Kim dynasty is paranoid but not stupid, and its longtime grip on power shows there is a logic to its actions.

If the US has decided not to allow a missile threat to the homeland, a limited strike would not be wise.  The North would surely retaliate, perhaps by attacking Japanese bases as a way of stirring up Korean nationalism.  Then what?

Iran, another threshold nuclear power, is watching carefully.  One possible approach would be to start a serious military buildup.  This would concentrate the minds of the Chinese and put the ball in the Northern court.  But of course the whole situation  is very dangerous."
"Interesting how the article describes the counter-protestors as normal folks expressing their opinions. It doesn't point out that they were ""antifa"" in their black outfits and black facemasks, some of them even carrying AK-47's and soviet flags (check out the video taken at the protests). These supposedly ""anti-fascist"" (but actually extremely fascist and racist) lunatics get cover from who they actually are from the media. They are extremely violent whenever they can gang up on someone but run away like cowards when confronted in even numbers."
"Actually I don't want it turned around my friend.   I think polices approved on the past have mixed results.  Millions of black Americans have moved to the middle class and hire.   Government can provide greater opportunity to American citizens.   The talk of eliminating all poverty or racism is just unrealistic political bs.   

One black representative does not reflect the Republican Party.   It's classic tokenism.   If you can show me a party plank that acknowledges the harm of racial bigotry I will most certainly read it!!"

"From a Catholic perspective, substituting ""black"" for ""gay"" falsifies the document, and how it sounds to modern ears is irrelevant.

The Church is silent on the source of “sexual orientation”, whatever that currently means in today’s jargon, except to note that the natural order is attraction between a male and a female.

Science has literally nothing to do with that.

Nor is there any comparison between racial bias and the Church’s teaching on same sex attraction. The comparison is a political one designed to equate two quite different things.

Since the Church’s teaching is based on the Natural Law, not St. Paul’s letter to anyone, it is not going to be changing. 

http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p3s1c3a1.htm

"St. Louis columnist, Sarah Kendzior,  in the G & M, said,""Real patriotism, Mr. Trump, isn’t how you treat a flag. It’s how you treat Americans.""
  Absolutely right.
   Authorities talk about making America (and Canada) great, prosperous, respected, united, but don't seem to care about Americans (and Canadians).
   National anthems aren't sacred; human life is sacred.
   This protest against police shootings of African-Americans should have been done during Obama's presidency; better late than never. Shootings were happening quite frequently several years ago. Obama's hands were tied, his mouth was sealed, by Republican obstructionism (and likely as well by his unwillingness to rock the establishment's boat).
   Today, ""Take a knee"" seems like a protest against Trump. That waters down the effect because almost everyone's protesting against Trump.
  Further I doubt the commitment of multi-millionaire black football heroes to rocking the boat.
  But much better than no protest at all."

"The RG must not know if he has a job or not.  Otherwise, they would put that in there too.  Some of the people who post here would say it's in the ""public interest"" to know.  Or maybe, they put it in there so if we see a group of young males with a ""light-skinned black male with medium build and dreadlocks who is believed to be in his late teens or early 20s"" in the group we can report it.  But, wouldn't that be profiling?"
"Sam Clovis, Donald Trump's pick to be chief scientist for the Department of Agriculture, pushed unfounded theories about then-President Barack Obama's upbringing and called then-Attorney General Eric Holder a ""racist black"".

"The statistics in Heather MacDonald's "" The War on Cops"" disprove the entire media narrative on Police brutality and the Black Community so I don't even believe in the cause, but even if it was a noble truth based cause, there have got to be better ways to raise awareness of it than refusing to stand as required by NFL rules and basic decency for the American anthem. It is disrespectful and totally ineffective. How is pissing off MILLIONS of Americans creating allies for their issue?"
"My, my let us see who is a racist.  Darren,   

You say: "" Obviously, not everyone who voted for Donald Trump was motivated by racial hatred""

I rejected the other option.... I didn't want a  pair of career criminals in the oval office - one as President with her husband as an illegal Shadow President.   Gender had nothing to with it.  In Obama's case, I vetted him and I found that his Marxist background and dedication to Marcusian repressive tolerance  and the tactics of Saul Alinksy made unacceptable for any public office.

You say:  ""President Trump being surrounded by a handful of black people that had worked on his campaign, who dutifully applauded""

Ahhhh.. very revealing about you Darren.  This means  Black person who strays from the Democrat plantation gets called  or is inferred to be an ""Uncle Tom"" .

MLK's bust was always there.  President Trump replaced the bust of Winston Churchill as well, that Obama as the  grandson of a Mau Mau terrorist  removed  his first day office."

Black people are not interested in apologies/discussions - what they want is ""redress""/ based on the assumption that it was Apartheid that took from them broke the prosperous state that existed say in 1950 - therefore the bike must be taken back from the bully and given to the ""rightful owners"". This is what NDR, EFF and BLF are all telling us, and what Tumi Muraki was referring to. It is certainly not about discussions, it is about taking that bike back.And with force if it must now that they are in power. It is a not so subtle threat - do as we tell you are we take everything from you."
"On the one hand, Viola Desmond will be gracing our new five dollar bill.

On the other, Black Lives Matter continues to make Toronto Pride a farce.

So it looks like we can both laugh and cry this February in Canada -- although I agree that the administration of our neighbours to the South has cast a pall over all minorities."
"""Didn't women march against that gender apartheid state a week ago???
ohh no they didn't... that would actually require courage.""

Can I ask how you have displayed your courage against that gender apartheid state?"
Excellent article.  So glad to see Sec. DeVoss and Ms. Jackson of OCR taking a look at this mess and hopefully bringing some common sense and reason back.  Our colleges have become cesspools of progressive liberal agendas and this is one of the results.
"Several councillors mentioned how today many black person still suffer the emotional scars of slavery of 300 years ago. I fail to see how the gay men of Toronto should atone for either the slavery or the immaturity of people claim to be lingering victims of it. The African slave trade is still on going in Arabic/Muslim countries, but nobody at BLM wants to talk about that."
"Interesting memoir. While I strongly believe big law is a terrible environment for most people, I appreciated hearing your perspective as a black female. I am glad you have found a direction that you enjoy more, but it's very unfortunate if racial differences were the driving reason for your career change. You seem like a well-rounded and high-achieving person and I'm sure you will find happiness and success."
"what is Canadian culture ?  Until someone can tell me it is simply another way to say you are being prejudiced.  To me, it is an amalgam of 150 years which includes a whole lot of folks from places as diverse as Ireland and Scotland, to India to China and Vietnam and even the USA.  And hey, Africa and South America too.  So while we wait for your clear and concise explanation of Canadian culture, I will sit back at Timmies and enjoy watching the hockey with the Muslim kid from London On, playing for the Leafs against a team with a few black kids from Scarborough on it."
"That Freddie was driven by an African American of course destroys your claim.....but hey, why let those pesky details get in the way of an otherwise perfectly valid arguemnt."
"Awwww, deflect with the snowflake talk all you want, it's the delicate little flowers that are the snowflakes, it's the excrement of society that showed us the true snowflakes that were all out protesting after the election because they didn't get their way.  It's the snowflakes that send back Dr. Suess books and believe everything that Al Gore tells them.  So the football players have all been exposed as to how altruistic they are about this entire thing since they suddenly realized that their bank accounts would be getting hit.  All this over police brutality, such brutality as was just proven innocent in the death of a black man who refused to follow orders and not reach for his gun.  He is dead and the policeman is found innocent."
"Senator Sanders has been a mayor and a Senator for a relatively short period of time.  Some of his arguments about judgements on legislation  and the idea that people don't make mistakes and even take responsibility for them is flawed.  Innuendo's used by his campaign are fraught with misinformation and misleading statements. No Senator is allowed to make money from making speeches. If you're a woman who has been required to do more than men are required to do in situations and there are no rules in place to demand you do it, all women would be ticked off.  Heck Senator Sanders said when he was on the campaign trail sometime ago on the west coast the families taxes would be shared in a day or so.  But his taxes weren't shared, and this years taxes weren't done close to deadline.  Secretary Clinton shared 30 years of taxes immediately. Taxes seems like a small issue but don't call the ""kettle black"", it you don't follow some fairly easy requirements. Not beneficial to be stubborn."
"CUE:  "" Hell, Mr. Kesey even bred Jerry Garcias wife and conceived a child.) ..  BRED HER? WAS SHE A COW, A HORSE....A THING? that is so offensive , i burned off an enail to civil asking them how can that be civil? where is the box to check for just plain , crudely offensive. From the same guy that spoke of his ""10"" member""  - twice he made that reference. it cracked me up , but what does that have to do with anything related to the story? who says that? OMG. rude, crude and ..... crude. always a sideways nasty reference about women , black, gays, ""druggies""  - it's not even an attempt to input - its like a broken record.
 sorry if i've offended anyone - but if you could review all his posts, in context - it's disturbing. hateful. for good and bad - i have a memory for that type of thing - data entry.  i remember stuff..even in my drug addled, math fail brain. his slam for me & others ""druggies'"
"Here's Drumpfster's thinly transparently coded, vast left wing conspiracy/Black Lives Matter, remark:

– He told the Pennsylvania crowd to get a group of friends together on Election Day, vote and then go to ""certain areas"" and ""watch"" the voters there. ""I hear too many bad stories, and we can't lose an election because of you know what I'm talking about,"" Trump said. ""So, go and vote and then go check out areas because a lot of bad things happen, and we don't want to lose for that reason.""

He was speaking to his loyal xenophobes and referring to the two wankers who play ""New Black Panther Party"" dressup, standing outside a Philadelphia polling place, every four years. The media shows up for this goofy duo like it does annually for Groundhog Day in Punxsutawney, PA.

The truth is, those lames have never changed anyone's vote. It's a 99% black precinct where The Donald is polling at zero-point-zero.  But when he gets hammered, he can claim the election was ""stolen."""
Look at who is calling the kettle black!  It is you BoC that has held rates at such low levels for so long that has created the debt binge in the first place!   Have rates at a level that makes people think twice on taking on so much and no issue!
"As a Bernie supporter, I held my noise and voted Clinton because I knew Trump's history and that of his running mate. 

Women, people of color, LGBTQ, immigrants (documented or not), the non-religious/non christian, the physically impaired, those with chronic illness, those who like to breath clean air and drink clean water, the environment, science, wildlife, and our planet earth all know that Trump is by far the worst of two evils."
"You just described why immigration is so beneficial and is what built America. I am probably more familiar with the history of the labor movement, especially its violent history here in Ludlow and elsewhere, than you are. If you imagine Rockefeller was going to pay $25 an hour to coal miners, and that the country would be what it is today if he had, you're imagining things. Your Italian ancestors came here to make a better life in the land of freedom and liberty. Each generation builds upon the last. It's the story of America, and this current experience is not very different from the previous ones. They all brought language barriers and crime with them, but we dealt with it. Now that they're brown and black, we the descendants of the earlier waves of poor European immigrants have become the new Know-Nothing Party. Shameful.

By the way, I don't mean literally that you are Italian, I don't know if you are. That was just an example."
"Building hotels outside of the US isn't presidential, it's business and running this country takes more than making money and flipping the bird at women, veterans, people of color, and people with disabilities.

""I also agree Obama’s record of disasters speaks for itself."" Here is a prime example of your lying. I never wrote/agreed to that but you post it as if I did.
You expect people to respect your opinions but when you openly lie your credibility and the respect of others disappears."
"I didn't like Bush and didn't vote for him, but I think the real road to Trump, wasn't Bush, but Obama.  It was a mix of the freak out that a black man with a funny sounding name was now President and people who just hate everything that is left of center.  Those 2 groups metastasized into the Tea Party which did a bang up job at stopping Obama at every turn.  Couple that with the right wing scream machine and you had the perfect storm."
"Yes, moon howler, I have the right to express my opinions on the Globe online - just as you have the right to post your continual contempt against people like the Prime Minister.  Conrad Black is a convicted felon with minimal legal background.   Those are facts.  Having his column posted 6 times as if it were holy scripture is more than enough (that's my opinion.)"
"If we start at the end of the Civil War, the 'race' card has been on the table for 151 years. 

In that time, ethnic groups from all over the world from Vietnam to India to China to Indonesia to Lebanon to Russia to the Ukraine to Georgia to Bosnia to Mexico to Guatemala to Cuba  and dozens of other places have managed to come to this country and succeed where those black people here at the end of the Civil War and their descendants have not.  

There must be something else that can work than what we've done so far.   

I'm clueless as to what that might be.  Integration, Affirmative Action, All sorts of things have been tried but the immigrants keep doing better than those who have been here for 150 years."
"Actually you make a good point. If I were born Jewish, I would always be a Jew regardless of what religion or belief system I adopted or practiced. Some religions are synonymous with race or so they identify as such. But there are Christian Jews, Buddhist Jews and so on. People are persecuted for their religions daily, so they are NOT protected. Their right to choose and practice IS protected by law. While it is true that I can't change my (born) color as you say, I can change my sexuality on a dime if I desire. Until it is proven that people are born as an LGTB human being (with verifiable DNA or genetic science). Sexuality is simply a choice.Many folks have had gay experiences, especially in the 60's & 70's and it didn't make them gay, but many chose to be gay as a result of those experiences. So I maintain, sexuality is a personal self-view. That is the heart of the argument here. So being black and being gay are NOT the same thing. You feel they ARE and the law IS on your side."
"Simply a shocking argument that attempts to nullify common sense. Affirmative action IS racism and sexism- to deny people admission based on race is text book racism. ""Antifa"" the violent left wing fascists, who cover their faces before attacking are completely ignored, and not much word on Venezuelas current left wing fascism either, noticably. As much as the KKK types should be ridiculed, this time around the real trouble is stemming from the left. Trump was correct when he said ""many sides"". 
""Lost in the tumult""- Trump's record low unemployment rate at 4.3% (Trudeau at 6.3%), record drops in illegal crossings and deportations of MS13 gangs, federal help in combating the horror of Chicago gang violence, return of companies lost to globalization, 42% women voters and 1/3 of Latinos voters and record high black voters for a republican candidate and 5 consecutive defeats of democrats. Truth can never be found in the pages of MSMs. The power no longer lies with them, rather the voters."
"Another way to look at it would be to ask a question:
They are agreeing with Kap?
Kap is a radical believer in the koran?
Kap suports BLM and its violence against policemen.
Kap's beliefe in the koran means he is advocating the down throw of the constitution of the United States to be replaced by S. law?
Are these young adults alining themselves with a belief that identifies them for the rest of their life as possible radicalized believers of the koran?
The koran states in writing that it is at war with the United States.
Are these young adults now combatants willing to take up arms committing violence in our streets and back yard of our communities for beliefs espoused by national recognized symbols of our society?
Here is the hard question: As an elderly person walking the streets and paths of Alaska see these ""possible"" commiters of violence to my person and how to protect my self or should I be violent in return?"
they forgot to put in the real reason rod went up there to introduce himself and ask him to slow down because he had run people in the ditch..and they were all neighbors that lived on the road that were very concerned about  his driving.and my understanding is the black gentleman got all racist with the neighbors. Rod has lived in that area for many years with no problems.the black gentleman has lived there a very short time and is already causing lots of problems with the neighbors...which iam one of them so I have seen it first hand.
"Black lives matter is practically a terror network not supporting national unity and rule of law in these United States, Nana Regional Corporation recognizes the perversions of her actions along the same lines...we shareholders approve and support their actions to fire someone who hates the Greatest Presidant of the United States of America. Mrs. Brickman obviously does not share our views and was kindly let go of which she has no case against Akima otherwise she is welcome to try her self inflicted departure in the capacity of freedom of speech denied conservatives nationwide especially on collegic campuses."
"No, Schatz prefers a president who condones BLM killing Law Enforcement officers.  Anyone with eyes could see there were violent troublemakers on both sides in Virginia.  Leftist counter demonstrators were wearing helmets and masks, carrying sticks for weapons and shouting ""Who owns this street? We do!""
How dare Schatz invoke being a Jew after he refused to attend the Prime Minister's of Israel gravely important address to Congress warning us about Iran.  How did a pipsqueak anti-American political hack like Schatz get elected?  Words cannot express my disgust and disappointment with him.  He's not my senator."
"highandry - I am unsure how one disagrees with black letter law.

In fact Uber Canada has this to say at its website:

""Driving with Uber is a great way to earn extra cash, whether you're paying off bills or saving for a vacation. When tax season rolls around, you need to keep these extra earnings in mind though.

As an Uber partner, you’re an independent contractor; meaning you are self-employed. This matters when filing your taxes.
...
We also provide an annual Tax Summary on your Uber profile to help you and your tax advisor understand your earnings.""

Uber has partnered up with TurboTax which notes:

""Money earned from Uber driving is considered self-employment income and taxed as such. You may deduct eligible expenses from the fees you collect but calculating those expenses can requires detailed record-keeping. Not only must you keep track of the kilometers you drive for business, you must also record the rest of the kilometers you drive the vehicle throughout the year."""
"And who would the unbiased sources be? Federal bureaucrats who gave 90% of their political donations to Democrats, whose party leadership cares more for acquiring reliable blocks of voters than in doing what's best for Americans and America's fiscal stability? I was a Democrat. And then I lived in two inner cities and witnessed first hand what I came to see as self-interested political leaders who only stop by every other November to pick up the votes of inner city residents. I've read that (Democrat) Patrick Moynihan warned his Party that the way they (LBJ and Congressional Democrats) were structuring welfare would destroy the Black American family. For his troubles, Senator Moynihan was roundly castigated by his fellow Democrats. And now we have millions of fatherless children in our inner cities (the illegitimacy rate has tripled since the War on Poverty began). I have been reading the Los Angeles Times for years. If the paper is not a pro-illegal immigrant echo chamber what is?"
"I would hope that the ""historic choice of the first female president"" would result in the election of a woman who hasn't been the subject of so many unconscionable controversies.

Instead of discussing why the electorate failed, this publication could state why Hillary failed. Hillary failed as a First Lady, she failed as a U.S. Senator, and she failed as a Secretary of State. She failed as a candidate.

In eight years as a senator she only sponsored eight bills, three of which passed. That is a paltry number for any legislator. As Secretary of State she had little to show in her favor, and a lot to show in her failure. Benghazi was a huge black eye. Very few Secretary of States have had an ambassador killed on their watch--especially when forces were available to save said diplomat. As First Lady she protected a sexual predator--her husband--while trying to destroy the women he defiled. 

Wikileaks provided the proof that many needed to look elsewhere.

Trump was flawed as well."
"Black Lives Matter is comprised of the intellectually lazy.... content to yell from their bullhorns that a problem exists, but wanting no part in the solution lest they be held accountable for its results....the intellectual equivalent of the guy who points out in the woods that you're lost yet who offers no plan to ease the way back to camp."
"Geez Larry Davis....recent American history isn't that hard to understand (unless of course you purposely don't want to understand it). So I'll help ya out here:

In the 1960s there was a fight for the heart and soul of the Democratic party...should it follow the tradition of the southern pro-Jim Crow democratic racists or follow the Northerner Democrats who were fighting for desegregation and voting rights for black Americans. Well Larry, in case you haven't heard, the Northerners won and the southern racists in the democratic party became republicans because the republican party was supportive of the segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever platform and trying its best to keep black Americans from voting. Hence, since the late 1960s/early 70s, the ideals of Lincoln have belonged to the Democratic party. 

There....you just learned something today Larry. BTW, you're welcome."
"Left-wing politicians get new friends whenever they think that the political winds are changing. In recent years, they have abandoned the LGBTQ community for their new friends - the Muslims. Liberal and leftist politicians have also done absolutely nothing to lessen poverty amongst blacks in the U.S. or Canada. Their policies have kept them poor deliberately so that they can remain permanent clients of the state and the poverty industry."
"dome: YOU are just so upset because the general public is tired of YOU claiming RACIAL Discrimination. Because YOU are BLACK, YOU got away with it up in Washington, and you received a claim here. YOUR last PROFESSIONAL PLAINTIFF effort here a few months ago was shot down.. YOU have LOST ALL CREDIBILITY here in this city, county, state. I personally know four people who work with you in and around YOU. NONE of them like YOU. And, its worse than that. I am told a MAJORITY of workers around YOU, DO NOT LIKE YOU. Lane County needs to clean out the BAD APPLES, and YOU are not only a BAD APPLE, YOU are a ROTTEN APPLE.

Read the Sign: REALITY"
Not being black perhaps the Sanchez family will get some justice....I hope....
"It is complicated.  For every moron who says something like ""you don't look that black to me""  there is a society (plenty of people) which still seems to all too often implement the ""one drop"" convention, as mixed race people try to manoeuvre though the minefield.  I get her frustration."
"I'm guessing with the current state of affairs black people are just naturally putting their hands up in an effort not to be shot.  Though everyone keeps saying what would he go to his car for other than a gun? I call it simple logic I keep my registration in my damn car in the glove box along with my insurance.  Usually a cop always asks for license and registration even if you're broke down.  So I would assume that's what he headed to his car for, because that would be my instinct but since he's dead we will never know now will we?"
"After researching the reason why Miss AK didn't win, I discovered the answer to the key question by the winner.  She is a Black woman from D.C.  She has a high paying job.  In answer to a pageant question, she stated she did not believe healthcare was a ""right"", but a ""privilege"".  Anyone unemployed didn't ""deserve"" healthcare paid by those who are employed. If the question and answer carried any actual weight in the voting, Miss AK should have won instead of this privileged individual's idiotic response to the key question.  Plus she wasn't as pretty as Miss AK."
Some how we are supposed to believe everything Indians and blacks say. In my neighbourhood every Indian is up to no good besides the drinking and drugs and sneaking into apartment buildings at night and defecating and urinating in the stair wells. Blacks have accosted me a number of times . Of course I racial profile.
"Quite an exhaustive investigation you did there. Ever heard of ""institutional racism""? So you actually expect a black cab driver to candidly discuss racism? I can't say for sure whether Trump is a racist, but the fact that is a despicable and disgusting human being does it for me."
"I doubt you would survive being black in this country. The 1st time you tried to argue with a cop, you would be killed and the cop would get time off with pay to recover from killing you. You would not survive childhood. Cops get away with killing black children too."
"I saw a chart recently of the most dangerous (rape,murder,violence,robberies etc) cities in the US. The safest cities were the ones with the fewest blacks,the most dangerous cities had the highest vback population. The author was panned as being racist."
"Or a black person. Or a brown person. Or a female person. Or a gay person. Or a Muslim person.

You must not be aware of his actual history on issues concerning those persons."
"Attack the messenger, the favorite ploy of the Republican traitors dedicated to the overthrow of the U.S. Constitutional Republic and all laws derived therefrom.  German appellation in full support of the new German Fuehrer/Il Duce Trump wiping out all law enforcement for themselves while creating new laws against the least powerful citizens of color and non-christian religion.  Traitors to all that is decent and humane in order to serve the Mammon masters represented by the worst traitor of all - Trump."
And people wonder why so many young black males are behind bars.
"Thats what he's doing genius. He's supposed to fight for the causes of his constituents do you not understand our form of government? If they do not like it they will vote him out I doubt you live in his area but maybe you do. Are you even aware the national anthem started as a Pub song, and sounded little like the boring ass one you hear today. By the way Jesus has no historical documentation, other that the bible and by that logic Thor is real too along w Zeus, but also if he had been real you would refer to him as being black, and being black he would probably take a knee, and not berate, and become angry with people protesting violence."
"Free speech for everyone! Well except for Conservatives and any others who disagree with the Black Lives Matter thugs and their Comrades in the resistance. If you don't like what the KKK people are saying then shut up, don't listen and go home."
"Oh Ian, great piece, and like so many others, we totally get it in our house. We have a Toby, too, who looks just like yours. And a Duke, who's solid black."
"The organizations are all special interest groups that have no direct relation to health care. I thought that the ""core"" of the NAACP was black people, and that the ""core"" of the NRA was gun owners, so enlighten me if those are incorrect. I don't know what beer has to do with anything, I haven't had one since November and it might be September when I have another one."
"pissedoffMarine, I agree with you 100%. This disrespect for our symbols of freedom are a slap in the face to all soldiers and American patriots. Who the hell do they think supports this game? Without a fan base; the team is nothing. The Broncos' fans are the most loyal in the country. They are loved whether they win or lose. This B.S. will ruin this team, if allowed to continue. My heart is broken to see this insane behavior condoned. Elway could take lessons from a more experienced owner, Jerry Jones. Of course, Texans are unique. They love AMERICA. Jerry Jones said emphatically ""Stand up or be fired. You will no longer be part of this team."" I believe all Cowboy players are relieved that they have no choice. They don't have to be bullied into being sheep because they are black. If they do not honor the Flag and National Anthem, no paycheck; contract cancelled. How easy would it be for all owners to keep the focus on football & tell them to go do this on their own time; not at work!"
"They were started because the democrats of the south withheld education from blacks. After he civil war, people moved into the south to establish schools and to educate freed slaves. Republicans freed the slaves and then worked to educate them, unlike the democrats which fought tooth and nail well into he 60's to keep blacks from education..never forget DEMOCRATS were the KKK, DEMOCRATS voted down equal rights legislation for blacks.."
"Thanks for speaking in a sensible and rational way, we all need more of that today, and not the heated and hate talk of Ray.  Ray I hear more of my black acquaintances and the few real black friends use the N word constantly and every-time they do it makes me very uncomfortable."
"The ""right to life"" is a natural law, protected by the Constitution.  If your religion believes in ""slavery"" or ""blacks are only 3/5 human beings"" (see Dred Scott ruling), should we call that freedom of religion?"
"That's not true.

""Republicans have cut deals with opposing black Democratic state legislators to create majority-black districts. By packing black Democratic voters into a single district, they can essentially ensure the election of a black Congressman or re-election of a black state legislator due to the packed concentration of Democratic voters. However, the surrounding districts are more safely Republican in areas like the South, where white conservatives have increasingly shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party in national elections in the last four decades.""

""Bipartisan gerrymandering refers to redistricting that favors the incumbents in both the Democratic and Republican Parties. Bipartisan gerrymandering became a salient practice in the 2000 redistricting process, which created some of the most non-competitive redistricting plans in American history.""

"I do not go to the game to be subjected to players or others taking advantage of me as a captive audience, paying a lot to be entertained, not to be subjected to a few players deciding to use that  forum for their personal political views, whatever those views may be. I keep hearing this is their right. What about my right. Can I go to the stadium with others and protest like the players do or would I be thrown out of the stadium?

How about Michael Bennett's lies about what happened to him in California when he said the police held a gun to his head and they stopped him because he was black etc. The video of all of it showed he ran from the police and was held for about 10 minutes until they could determine he was not the gun bearer that had been reported to the police. No gun was held to his head or any other part of his body. He said he was fearful for his life. Also, not supported by the evidence. Yet he sits in disrespect claiming his statement that blacks are mistreated."
"Mayor Tory is dead wrong.

As long as Pride is willing to allow itself to be dictated to by the racist hooligans at Black Lives Matter, and shun a police presence because BLM is somehow against police, , then it does not deserve public funding of any sort. 

This has nothing to do with gay pride, and everything to do with BLM's racist and antagonistic agenda. 

Don't give them one cent."
The core of the article seems to be about the failure to mobilise the disgruntled citizens on a massive scale. It is possible that most organisation have lost touch with the ordinary citizen. Ordinary black people can march without being provided with or food. What they  do not tolerate is people who come to them only wen they need votes or support for something. Those are people you do not engage through social media or TV ad radio. The are people who want real human beings to come and talk to them face to face. Remember when Malema organised a march from Randburg to Pretoria?
Surprising aye...being brown....and black and all
"The margins show more D's voted for the bill than Rs.
And that's with the Dixiecrats voting against it.
Democrat JFK called for it in 1963. Democrat LBJ  made use of his experience in legislative politics, along with the bully pulpit he wielded as president, in support of the bill. Your assertion that it ""was a politically strategic move that LBJ et al supported once it was clear that blacks were going to be integrated and given the vote, anyway (thanks to Republicans,"") is a farcical lie. The Democrats controlled both the House and Senate by big margins. The Republicans couldn't pass anything on their own.
As for D switching to R, I'm talking about the voting patterns in the South.
Look at this map. It's overwhelmingly Red. It used to be Blue.

They should all stand for the anthem and the NFL should run a film of all the black people shot for nothing that they have video of.  Let the issues each have their own time.
"Possibly, but let's hope it isn't.  Who knows what horrors await next?  But somehow I feel that you like him provoking the media, blacks, the poor, and illegal immigrants.  Should we now add uppity, overpaid athletes to the list?"
"Blacks have been banned throughout history from many organizations including politics, military, police on the last century.

You know nothing about the goals of the Evergreen demonstration, a one day event.   Yet you put up a childish whine and compare one day to a lifetime of facing racial bias.    

I won't attempt to respond past this one Bill.  We just have very different perspectives"
"Upon learning of the ""enormous extent of their contribution"" black soldiers had in building of the Alaska Highway, republican lawmakers quickly asked to see it's birth certificate.

Thank you, thank you... I'll be here all week."
"If the government was ear marking $500 million to educate Canadians  how terribly we have treated  natives, how racist our history of black slavery , how misogynist our treatment of women , the evil  oppression of  our french population,   our  treachery towards gay and homosexuals,  how  stupid we are about the devastation we have wreaked upon what was once a beautiful land, the Globe would say it is money well spent. But it is being spent to celebrate our achievements in creating a good place to live and that to the Globe is just just a big waste of time and money. ."
Black Lives Ma... oh wait!
"Good. Maybe they can take up the issue of blatant sexual discrimination in the NFL......where ""women"" belong on the sidelines only as cheerleaders.....in the locker room only as ""female reporters""....but apparently have no place on the sidelines as part of the ""elite coaching staff"" that coordinates plays, makes substitutions, assesses strategies, and develop routes.
-
Perhaps if the NFL was not the sexist organization it is.....and actually had women on the sidelines who were there because of the ""brains"".....and not how they look in somewhat skimpy cheerleading attire.....Cam Newton would not have been ""surprised"" that, yes, ""females know football."" 
-
It wasn't that long ago the NFL was both Racist and Sexist. There were no black quarterbacks and no black head coaches because Racists Attitudes questioned their ""intellectual capabilities.""
-
Now the NFL is just Sexist...questioning females ""intellectual capabilities""....that promotes the Sexist attitude that lead to Cam's comment."
"It's called ""black privilege""."
"Was it around the time of Trudeau 1.0 or Mulroney that blacks started appearing in great numbers throughout the Canadian landscape? Canada wasn’t a colonial power like France or Britain, so why did this have to happen?"
"The facts are that BLM does NOT promote violence.   You are simply wrong.   Some people who showed up at some of their protests did commit violence.  BLM themselves never did nor did they call for it.   

You wouldn't want all cops to be painted with a broad brush when one of them shoots an unarmed citizen in the back, would you?   Assuming you wouldn't, I must ask why you are doing the same with BLM.

Is it because they're black?

I have done nothing but condemn violence in this thread and yet you have repeatedly accused me of endorsing it.   You obviously live in your own alternate reality and are immune to reason.

LOL at ""alternate forms of enlightenment"".   Is that like the alternative facts that Kellyanne Conway speaks of?   Maybe like that time MLK murdered all those people in Bowling Green?

How about trying actual facts instead of these ""alternative facts"" you and our president are so fond of?

Will you condemn the violence of the alt-right?"
"what a beautiful thing this is.   one of the bad things about the mainstreaming of black culture (as well as that of other minorities), is how it brought about the end of so many of the black community structures such as these."

"""If I was racist I wouldn't live in the neighborhood."" Yes because clearly it take ""most liberal"" person to be willing to  live around brown and black people.

She could have focused on the same food and cuisine while actually promoting the actual cultures and countries the dishs are inspired by. The name is questionable but there is no question about her responses."
"Except people 'hated' Bush because he's a moron whose administration, among other things, deliberately misled the American people to invade Iraq, a 9-year boondoggle that cost the lives of thousands of coalition forces and hundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians, and at least $2 trillion in American treasure. People of all political stripes may have (rightly) questioned Bush's intelligence and competence as a leader, but I don't recall anyone on the left asserting that he was a Kenyan-born muslim and an illegitimate president. Bush was disliked for being an imbecile; Obama was hated for being black."
"Simple. If you want a service oriented economy, then diversity is a strength (think Silicon Valley or Hollywood - if it was unicultural, they wouldn't be as successful. Hollywood has had great success with Jewish, Black, Asian, Latino and other cultures represented in it. If they insisted only on WASPs, then they wouldn't have been an national or international success. Ditto for the Silicon Valley).

If you want to be purely a manufacturing country (think China or Japan) then multiculturalism is a weakness. Come to think of it, even in the military sphere, multicultural countries like the USA, Russia, the British EMpire, etc have been more successful than uni-cultural ones like Germany, Japan, China, etc"
Why didn't the democraps ban guns when they were in charge of congress and Obama was president?  Because they don't want to!  They want to beat the repubs with the idea but in fact they are happy with blacks killing blacks nonstop. They are happy with terrorist attacks so they can advance their agenda dn take away more freedoms with each one.
Rod you do have the option of living us and move to another country where your taxes won't be directed towards paying black people to have more children.
Apartheid didn't consider anybody subhuman? Remind me what that delightful name for any black person during Apartheid meant? Certainly not 'my fellow equal human'.
"I almost agreed w/you dg, but we parted in 'gut feelings' or just pure head thoughts.  Not too many here are saying that....or thinking that.  THIS story is about this statement in Mr. Twyfords letter:

""Shooting a cop is always worse than shooting a criminal or suspect who won’t cooperate.

It’s racism, plain and simple — by blacks, again, still""  THIS mindset is dangerous and if I'm not mistaken, is what ScienceDuck is picking up and Icon66 too.  4:20's contribution?  ....ah..........not so much of nothing, lol.  

So I don't think any of us would disagree w/you IF that was what was happening here.  SD and Icon66 feel free to publicly correct me if I'm wrong but DG I just don't think the  rant and aggressiveness' is warranted here.  

I submit to you MHO.  L2G"

"After listening to Black speak to the press and say he is inclined to keep Holland as the closer....really? Can anything be more obvious than the guy needs a role change asap? That statement alone has me questioning Black running this club in a pennant race. Shocked I just heard that....

This game should have been 8-2 heading into the 9th but they just wasted opportunities a number of times..The back half of this lineup is just putrid right now...This team is very lucky that the other clubs that they are competing with have been equally as poor of late. Good grief this has been tough to watch."

"The Feudal Empire aided and abetted by the U.S. government/military attacks its neighbors based on theocratic Islamic sect justification covered up by claims of funding terrorism.  The old ""Pot calling the Kettle Black"" phony reasoning as they, themselves, continue the funding of ISIS and Al Qaida.  The Monarchy responsible for 9/11 and the previous attacks on the World Trade Towers.  All coming from the same Islamic Sectarian philosophy of Feudal Monarchy Dictatorship rights.  Meanwhile, Trump says ""Hallelujah"" with billions of arms to wreak further havoc in the entire Middle East.  Time for a Revolution."
"How is it possible to consider that the ANC will come to the rescue of  South Africa on some future date when they are the current robbers of our Republic?
We must not harbor  any illusions , the only way to regain our country is through the ballot.
The corrupt ANC has now opened the door for the opposition parties to gain power. Racial politics will still prevail at the next election, for this the IFP has a major role to play in convincing the rural electorate as a corrupt free and good governance alternative. The DA to embrace and exceed all the populist policies of the ANC. The DA must be viewed as an ANC but without the corruption and poor governance for it to be able to attract meaningful black vote. The public face of the DA needs to change completely.
In the current dire situation we are facing, for all the opposition parties to come together and jointly plan and execute a strategy to relieve the ANC of power."

"You're wrong, here's why. I have heard interviews with blacks who go by the statues, and are vividly reminded of slavery hurting their family for generations, and Jim Crow laws (laws discriminsting agsinst blacks long after the Civil War), and lynchings & killings by the kkk & other racists inspired by the statues. This is very real for some people, so it's just as if youbsaw a statue of Hitler (and your faamily was killed or in camps during the Holocaust), or Saddam Hussein (taking that statue down was important)  or Milosevisc, or Stalin. It absolutely does hurt real people, no matter what Hannity or Alex Jones says."
"Even though I am not a great fan of the president even I am getting tired of lop-sided news reporting.  Obama wouldnʻt take no where near a stance but rather pander to BLM and the muslim communities when such atrocities were committed yet he is still considered like a little god by many out there.  Now no matter what our president does the media takes a position to, ""Attack, attack, attack"".  Shame, shame, shame."
"Finally a comment that considers the plight of this young man that brought him to this place.  There are too many like him that start life out in the negative digits.   Some people that start life way below others do make it in life & don't become murderers, but I don't think this is the norm. I read about two boys that were black (which was already a strike against them) that were in prison.  Both their IQs were really low. Doesn't mean that their IQ was that low to begin with. There is something disturbing when you hear that one young man was passed around for sex to his buddies by his step-father. The other boy's mom sat him on a hot burner on the stove to punish him for being a bad boy. I guess this taught him to not behave! Yeah, right. It doesn't mean that they should go free, but I guess I can feel some compassion for people like this due to their circumstances. Also, statements like ""I was treated badly and I turned out okay."" You weren't born with his basic traits."
"Nancy Shurtz please hang in there and fight this lynch mob.  I suspect that you had no negative intentions toward anyone.  The notion that you knew that black make-up was forbidden is contrary to the notion that diversity is tolerated at UO.  If you resign, you re-enforce this extremely pernicious behavior pattern.  It is those who have so little regard for your life and happiness that should be expelled from the University.  I am sorry you must endure this.  Be brave.  Persist and you will teach tolerance and respect for diversity.  Resign and you encourage mindless mob thinking."
"She apologized for the remark? It was a Clinton Presidency ""program"", a program which sent many Afican Americans to jail, an apology just doesn't work.

As far as the question I asked, I will answer for you-""pantsuit on fire"" is for women and LGBT rights-if it happens to be a election year, but in the off years she (Clinton FDN) is collecting millions from counties ( too many to list) that stone women to death for minuscule reasons, and prosecute/kill homosexuals for being different, I assume Arlene you are ok with this?

Instead of speaking against this and condemning these nations, Hilary, well let's just say she prefers to make bank ($$).

I'll vote with a very clear conscience, I hope you can do the same."
"Truly sorry to hear of your issue, Raven, but perhaps you can afford to pay for the treatment you are getting, however it is being paid for. Persons such as myself, without the money or training to reach for the next rung of the economic ladder, would be unable to afford the kind of pricing they were battering about in the above article. It would be a choice of cremation or burial plot, not a choice of being alive or not. $200,000 for a life-saving treatment is far out of the average American's price range, even if it saves their life. It would be trading personal freedom for a slave's collar, spending the last of your days trying to pay off a huge weight of debt. And that would be IF the company was willing to let you pay it off over time, instead of demanding the money up-front, or see your way out the door, Jack. Would this company be willing to foot the bill for a poor, single-mom, black woman in Detroit? Or would they 'decline' to save her life for lack of profit?"
"Funny. Lewis won't admit that African-Americans largely voted for Obama because he was black. That's why they didn't show up in the same numbers for Hillary, contributing to her loss."
"Hello Charles. I for one have grown weary of the race card thrown at every opportunity. You have stated here that you vote for the dem. party because at least they give you the crumbs from the table. I'm going to put this out there for you. What are you doing to help the black community? What are the blacks in the inner cities doing to better their own destiny? There is not a single one of us who can change the past, we must look to the future and quit supporting failed policies. That needs to come from all sides. Just bemoaning about the failures we as a nation have done to our inner cities and race relations gets us nowhere, in fact it just keeps us stuck. Do you want a better country for everyone? Do you think then that since we see so many failed policies we should try something different? Do you think maybe quite a few folks can begin by cleaning up their own side of the street?  I know it is harder to do the hard work instead of just complaining about the past but isn't it time?"
"Huh? The Christian religion was formed in the first century so are you saying Christian ideas are even less valid? And Judaism goes back even further so maybe that's even more irrelevant. Don't even mention Hinduism which is something like 7,000 years old. Or how about Socrates and Aristotle who lived over 2,000 years ago. Shakespeare wrote about 400 years ago which isn't that much more recent than Islam so maybe we shouldn't pay much attention to him either.

What modern philosophies do you follow? Where do you find spiritual guidance? Drake? Bieber?

Anyway, nobody is calling you a racist for what you described. We think you're racist because you're intolerant of people who are different from you. Oh, hey, that actually does make you a bigot!"
"You're reading something into the letter that isn't there, as have others.  What is there you think is intolerant?  The writers don't mention the professor in blackface at UO, and this may well be their attempt to bring about the change you speak of.  They don't mention Trump, only his divisive, inflammatory comments.  You still have not explained what is 'one-way tolerance'."

"There is nobody on this sight in the four years I've been writing that has worked any harder than I have to fight against bigotry and racism, specific to the area.  Most bigotry goes unrecognized and denied, because most have near zero experience or empathy  with black lives.

But if you're talking to me, it just shows that ignorance knows no one particular ideology.   I've said I'd vote for a dead horse before I voted for trump.  I've said nothing that implies racism to the site (although I've been accused of reverse racism).

Cleary you don't know a thing about me, but you want to play pious and accuse me of something that in no way I deserve.   

Nice introduction of yourself to what for the most part is a civil chat.   Your ignorance and lack of empathy for others can be your calling card."
"I often wondered about the backward slide of black culture. A culture that gave the world the blues, jazz and Motown ends up in the gutter with rap and hip-hop. What happened?"
"A man with a homosexual orientation going into the priesthood is not sacrificing a wife and a family of his own, he is just refraining from activity that as a Christian and a Catholic he is not supposed to engage in anyway. You can't give up something you don't have a desire for. Also, the priest is supposed to be the icon of Christ the bridegroom married to the Church. If a man isn't capable of marriage how can he reflect this in a priestly vocation?"
"""Actually, SCOTUS did not re-define marriage, or do anything even close to that!""

Nonsense.  Your system may be repulsed by the notion that is what Obergeffel did.  But that IS what it did.  Until Obergeffel, marriage by definition included ONLY man and woman.  

And you're right.  It took a Constitutional AMENDMENT to grant full equality to blacks, an immorality that as Jefferson said, was ""self-evident.""  Where's the Amendment with respect to marriage?  How is it ""self-evident"" that marriage is for man and man?  Until well past the initial craziness of this post-sixties, post-Christian age, the idea was laughable.

You seriously place slavery on a par with society's restriction of marriage to one man-one woman?  Your notion that they're even in the same league doesn't pass the laugh test."
"After ISIS ??? they are still committing mass genocide to this day genius, why because a do nothing Obuma pulled out far far  to early creating a deep  black a hole

No no must be Bush, fits your left wing ideology much better !!!"
"Saunders must be on crack to write an article like that.

I remember the night prior to the inauguration the leftists CBC had these 3 half wit kids on that were driving down to Washington to witness the disaster. There were talking absolute nonsense especially since police violence against black people would soon escalate and result in riots all over the country. 

If Saunders wanted something memorable he should take his kids down to Donald Trump's inauguration."

I would also not be shocked if it was a total fabrication that one of the patrons said that....seems a little far fetched."
"I am sure it was a beautiful liturgy, BCP, Anglican Evensong celebrated traditionally is really uplifting.
However, didn’t the Pope’s confidante and ‘éminence grise’, Fr Antonio Spadaro together with His Presbyterian sidekick, Rev Marcelo Figueroa recently label such alliances between Protestants and Catholics as the “Ecumenism of Hate”?
Does the Vatican’s right hand truly know what its left hand is doing?
Reading the above article, Archbishop Gallagher’s sole reason for Ecumenism is political.
Come to the think of it, how could the ecumenical relationship between Catholic Rev Spadaro and Protestant Rev Figueroa be described?
The original éminence grise was that Friar François Leclerc de Tremblay’s habit was beige (French translation ‘grise’= grey). It is alleged that he exerted enormous influence over the famous Cardinal  Richelieu, France’s 17th century First Minister. Spadaro’s habit is black, would it not be more fitting, therefore, to refer to him as ‘éminence “noire”’?"
"They wake up every morning and think, ""What really dickish, annoying things can I do today?"" The press hasn't gotten in line with the kind of slavish adoration exhibited by Trump's cabinet, so they're being punished, and Republican congresspeople can better evade the constant barrage of embarrassing questions. The whole thing is beginning to resemble some preposterous, black-comedy novel by Terry Southern, except it's true."

I dont support the NFL who will fine a player for honoring the 5 officers in Dallas but dont have the nads to consequent you privileged little crybabies.
I dont support those who are complete hypocrites when they say, ""While there’s no greater country, it’s not perfect. Inequalities still exist.""  Feel free to donate all your money to a food bank so that way you aren't richer than poor people.  That way we're all ""equal"".  And BTW, when did ""equality"" become the idol that we now worship?

"Wow, somebody woke up angry and forgot her duty to be truthful and objective.

""These include who is deserving of police censure versus protection: at least 155 people were arrested at protests in Ferguson, Mo., after an unarmed black teenager, Michael Brown, was shot to death by police.""  - Apart from the typo that should read ""protection vs censure"", a Justice department investigation - Obama's justice department - found that the police officer had acted justifiably in self-defense.  This was a man who had just robbed a convenience store and tried to steal a cop's gun.

""U.K. for the Brexit vote"" - so if you voted for Brexit you must be a racist?  Maybe you just think that the EU is a bloated anti-democratic bureaucracy that is destined to fail.

""It’s rewritten history so that cruel men such as Lee and Cornwallis are venerated as heroes"",  Nothing was rewritten.  Lee was a hero in his lifetime in the south.  And a villain in the north.  

Denise, this was one of your weaker efforts."
"Absolutely wrong.  You would be correct if you wrote ""A Democrat who thinks of a Republican as a lowlife simply for being a Republican can not help but make a tainted article about a Republican. Much the same way as a KKK on Blacks.""  I know not a single democrat who would ever think of a republican as a lowlife just because they identify as a republican.  I realize that is anecdotal evidence and that there must be some democrats out there that would do that, but let's be honest with ourselves here.  Lastly, a ""tainted article""?  What is tainted about the piece?  If you mean bias, then you are still confused on what an op-ed is.  It would be fair to pick apart what Adrian Tam wrote based on substance, but it is unfair to critique someone for having an opinion in an opinion piece.  It would be like lambasting an encyclopedia author for only including objective facts."

Look at how tightly so many ""freedom-loving patriots"" cling to the monuments to anti-black bigotry,  injustice, Jim Crow, and race-based inter-generational slavery.

"There is no way they'd be better armed than me . No way.  Had I lived in Baltimore or Furguson , or LA , my home would be left standing .  You are out of touch with today's democrats .  They KNOW that gun control laws can't stop mass shootings.  They're hope and wish is that ALL guns owned by every American will be eliminated from our country. They see that as the only way to stop these killings.  While they express outrage over Vegas , they sit back and turn a total blind eye to what's happening in Chicago every day of the week.   Don't you find it odd that Black Lives Matters protest when thugs get shot by police , yet say nothing and do nothing when their own brothers and sisters are getting slaughtered every day of the week by other blacks in Chicago ? In less than a month more blacks will have died at the hands of other blacks---mostly from hand guns--in Chicago than the total in Vegas.  How come the lost lives in Chicago don't matter to democrats or the national media--or you ?"
"If Leonard would temper his writing with some compassion for other cultures that suffer the same injustices and worse, in some cases, he might gain in credibility. This land was taken by force from native nations, who were then put on reservations under treaty agreements that never materialized. A large portion of the Southern part of our land, was taken from a people by force, also. Those people were then sent South to Mexico. Their Ancestors are buried in the United States, yet they are considered illegal immigrants if they come back with out using proper channels. How proper were the immigration channels used by the Europeans that came here in the first place? Blacks were not and are not, the only race that has been discriminated against. If Leonard's goal is to end prejudice and discrimination to all races, I'd be in his corner but it doesn't sound to me like he's concerned about anyone else. Every article he writes, basically says the same thing! Enough already!"
"Black Lives Matter, Antifa, Occupy Wall Street and The Nation of Islam to name just as few. And yes, fascism is a far-left ideology."
"America is built on violence and aggression. That's how they expanded from 7 colonies to taking over half of North America. When the Native Americans refused to give up their lands in the Southwest, Andrew Jackson got Congress to pass the Indian Removal Act of 1830 which forced them to leave on the Trail of Tears.

When Mexico refused to sell their province of California, President Polk instigated the Mexican-American War that allowed America to conquer California, Arizona, Texas and Nevada.

In today's world, many Americans celebrate the cowboy image of them patrolling their property with a gun. Just let a burglar break into my house and I'll fill him with lead! Having many guns is their love and it doesn't matter about the occasional incidents of mass shootings. Anyway most shootings involved African Americans who are on the bottom of society."

Then over 10,000 Americans were killed in the WTC, Iraq, Katrina,etc
Then unemployment increased to 10% and the American economy crashed because of their Republican policies. Then many Americans lost homes and life savings. Banksters were foreclosing on homes that did not have mortgages


Then 8 years ago, a black a guy was elected to clean up the Republican mess.
Unemployment dropped to under 5% and the stock markets tripled.
The S&P 500 went from 700 to 2,200."
"""The fact is that 59 million children have been aborted in the U.S. since Roe v Wade in 1973, and a..."" They are not children until they can breath on their own. Why do you give a pass to all the fathers of those lives? You are not pro life, just pro fetus. How many abortions do you think Trump has paid for? Why don't you support healthcare for all, if you care about the lives of children. How many kids are you willing to let be homeless? You don't believe in affordable public housing for those children. You care about those lives right up until you have to take some responsibility for those lives yourself. Once they can breath they are called takers by the likes of Trump voters and conservatives in general. BTW, I've spent more than 60 years being black. There is nothing you can teach me on the subject. The GOP is about to defund Planned Parenthood, a primary source for contraceptives for poor women. How is that going to prevent abortions?"
"Fannie Lou Hamer's suffering was by no means chosen as part of a calling, especially when she was arrested, sent to a prison and there nearly beaten to a pulp for trying to recruit and register black voters. She forgave those who had beaten her mercilessly, but by no means did she choose to be abused and dishonored that way. I also don't think Dr. King wanted his home bombed or his family terrorized. These were completely unjust and un-redemptive acts of hated. Both, however, accepted other people's cruelty and abuse with love. Both believed their suffering and openness to forgive would eventually win over their oppressors. They were holy people, truly engaged in the discipleship of Jesus."
"Not a single commenter has considered what it was like for the black fellow forced to ""take a joke.""

He had to sit there and realize that when a distinguished professor looks at him, all the old guy sees is skin colour, and the first place his mind goes is to slavery. Of course it reflects badly on Massey for such a senior professor to be so tone deaf."
I see the al-gore rithm  and a few did not like my true comment about how michelle nerobama will right her book about telling kids eating healthy and at the same time she is eating French fries which is true and also when she goes around and making comments about slavery that happened over 140 years ago is truly  trying to stir up trouble and turn it into a racial comment but I guess you liberals like the SA and other commenters with mental disorders can't stand the truth.

If you have 10 bears and kill 3 over bait, the remaining adult females can easily add another 3 or more by the next spring. Despite your protestations, as recently as 2014 Fish and Game has admitted that sport hunting and hunter-based control efforts, including bear baiting and even bear snaring, does not reduce black bear populations. The only effective way to reduce a population, so far, has been state employees shooting the bears from helicopters. Even then a black bear population will recover in a few years. http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=pressreleases.pr05292014

"Was Hillary really the first woman to be nominated for president?
It seems like such an old story. 
Firstly, there was Geraldine Ferraro, in 1984 the first woman nominated as a Vice-President. She lost in a landslide.
  Second, when America and the world were very ready for a leap forward, Hillary lost the nomination to a black man.
  Third Hillary's been in the news almost every day for 25 years. 
    Fourth, Hillary's been at the top or very near the top of the power chain for a quarter of a century.
  Fifth, ""Dynasty"" was a TV mini-series back in the 1970's that featured ruthless, wealthy, corrupt women fighting for power. In 2016 Hillary seemed redundant."

"How on earth can you apply your Algebra teacher's statement to History?  History has taught us how even the 'nicest' people behave when told it is okay to beat up a person with a different belief.  During the Civil Rights protests, anti-integration zealots attacked (killed) not only Blacks but anyone who defended them and their rights as citizens.  Nazis attacked  (killed) Jews at first, then anyone who helped them, then anyone they could label as 'lesser'.  I don't think anyone here is advocating for censorship of the airwaves.  As you say, flying the Confederate flag may be just a form of 'flippin the bird'.  

I may very well stop in at Pop's Smokehouse and try the Cheerwine; it sounds like fun, but not if I have to listen to any hate-filled rhetoric.  I have quite a few relatives who disagree me on things political, and we simply don't mention them when together."
"You're assuming that Blacks in the South are more supportive of racism than Blacks in Oregon.  Are you actually suggesting a) those Southern Blacks don't realize the Confederate flag is the symbol of racism or b) that they support racism and are content with Second Class citizenship?  I appreciate your ""understanding my position on the matter.""  I trying to understand yours and having difficulty.  Be happy to meet with you for a civil conversation in an effort to better understand your position on this and other issues.  Give me a call.  Gary Crum"
"Once again, without any evidence either way, the local populace prove their ignorance by going on a burning and looting spree. Sorry, it's just not good enough, but I won't be holding my breath to hear that any of them have been thrown in jail to answer for their disgraceful deeds.

And why shouldn't these two get bail? Every other accused murderer in this country seems to get it - oh no, sorry, they're normally always black aren't they, so that's fine."
"Sweden in another 25 years present trend continues will be a fractured nation of Asians, Blacks and native Swedes. According to the Globalist and bankers everything is going to plan!
More chaos you have the more control you have! Rule number one."
"Do you have a problem with children being exposed to politics? Do you expect them to know nothing and the day they turn 18 cast an intelligent vote? How is this a way to promote harm in the black community, racist?"
"Let me explain to you the Democrats ""better deal:""

1. Open Borders and Sanctuary cities
2. Identity Politics: You are the color of your skin and nothing more
3. Political Correctness:  Any speech we don't like is hate speech
4. Gender: You can be whatever gender you want and use any bathroom you want.  Chromosomes don't matter.
5. Global Warming:  We must immediately end the use of all fossil fuels and destroy all energy intensive jobs.  the only people that can use fossil fuels are democrats.
6. Black lives matter and nobody else matters.  Police need to be terrorized.
7. If you don't believe all of the above then you must be killed or sent to a re-education camp"
"Police officers are allowed to detain people to investigate crimes. 
That being said, I went to CSU and witnessed more than a dozen acts if police brutality. 
They have a lot of police and the culture is toxic.
If she were black..."
"The core of the BLM movement asserts that blacks are treated differently because of their skin color by police. That has not been proven. 
It makes people feel good about themselves to wear a T-shirt though. Really doesn't actually do anything. Kind of like our posts..."
"You 'black folks' will not get paid for all that labor prior to 1865.

You didn't perform that labor.  

Those who did have been dead for over 150 years.

You aren't going to get 40 acres and a mule, either.

I had two great uncles who fought in that particular war.  One fought on one side, one the other. 

They were from Missouri and neither gave a damn about slavery one way or another.  

Both survived.  And never spoke about the war afterwards. 

 Our family refuses to hate either of them for trying (in effect) to kill each other over such strongly held personal beliefs.  

 Our family got over the hate.  It is unfortunate that you cannot."
"No I do understand it. I quote: ""the rule has more to do with completely losing one's sense of proportion rather than just mentioning Nazis specifically""

I think your sense of proportion went out the window when you brought Trump (I could probably have forgiven the Hitler bit but you married them.) into a comparison with Apartheid era leaders and their policies. As has been mentioned here there was no program to eliminate the black population. There was a program of separate development which had the desire, at least initially, of being to the benefit of ALL groups. Also you forget that there was a war on against marxism and those that ""fell"" out of windows were soldiers/supporters fighting for a Marxist state. War is ugly- people die. You like many others seem to confuse the war part with the social part of that era. 

Apartheid era businessmen donating printing services to a political party leads to Leopold/Hitler/Trump references....Ok I concede- Godwins Law was a poor choice."
You mean like all the liberal losers Obama appointed during his first term that couldn't serve because they didn't pay their taxes?
"No, I said those were easy ways to recognize Nazis. 
Those same people also chanted ""Blacks will not replace us"".

The comment space is limited, so I just gave a single representative sample - and that had nothing to do with why I oppose them - I was answering your question about who I consider Nazis.

The reasons I oppose them go beyond merely the ways you can recognize them - that's a different question with a more complicated answer, which I gave in the post you just above yours.

As for your second point - if that was true then ""Self defense"" would not be a thing. And I said nothing about ""feelings"" - you made that up. 
I spoke of DOINGS. If somebody is swinging a knife in your direction - you're not just FEELING under threat, you ARE under threat and you have every right to shoot him.

But there is NO ethnic group that is a threat. That was the point. They all have a right to live as a group. There IS an ideological group that IS a threat and doesn't. They are called Nazis."
Hey there's Keith Ellison! How is our favorite Nation of Islam black supremacist doing these days in the Democratic Party?
"That is problem with your position, there is no way a person could prove they aren't a racist, because you can find racism in everything a person says or does. I continue to hear black parents talking about having ""the talk"" with their children. Here is what the talk should sound like. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEvMc-K8XHY&t=12s"
"So you trust a criminal justice system where your race, gender, wealth, or lack their of not to kill innocent people. That is not pro life to me. You don't care what happens to that child once it is born. They are on their own. You are okay with the cop killing of a 12 year old black child holding an air rifle in a public park, in an open carry state. We should abolish abortions the moment we care about all human lives. That is not going to happen in the next 4 years. I think you care about a fetus but could care less about a child that can breath on their own."
"I don't think anyone is devaluing the struggle of blacks and gays, however BLM and Pride have taken a serious step backward and I for one would also certainly describe BLM as malcontents as they have done absolutely nothing constructive to prove otherwise except to sow seeds of division and unrest."
"AP news feed.  Even worst a GoForward poll.  Who the heck is GoForward?  Well...""GenForward is a survey of adults age 18 to 30 by the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.""  When Goggled not much on them at all.  Hmmm...."
"I notice that Pandora does not say any prayers for blacks murdered by the police. I notice that she does not mention the shooting of Tamir Rice, for example."
Oh because you think it's appropriate that universities censor speech? Black and brown racists get open forums there all the time. You have no complaint.
"Obama and his wife set back race relations decades with his Presidency.  As the first black President, he could have moved our nation forward and helped to heal the divide that has existed since the Civil War.  Instead, he followed the lead of the race merchants such as Jackson and Sharpton and continued to feed victimhood to blacks as the cause of their blight.
With blacks killing one another at record rates, he blames racism.  The breakdown of the black family is a disgrace to our nation.  Unfortunately it can only be solved by honest, well-intentioned black leaders that do not continue to blame whitey for their condition.  In our major cities, where the black bloodletting occurs, Democrats and minorities have controlled the city governments for decades.  It ain't whitey's fault, he long since moved to the suburbs."
If thats true then why did Trump lose the black vote so badly?
"As a side benefit of all of these findings, Manafort, if his ""hands are truly clean,"" may have a good legal argument for malicious prosecution by an FBI and a special prosecutor WHO ALL KNEW that this dossier was a fraud.  The FBI, knowingly broke and entered Manafort's home with a S.W.A.T. team under false pretenses.  Now that is an aggravated felony and a pox on the FBI's house, if ever there was one.   This federal corruption must go even deeper.  I suspect that Barack Hussein Obama would be actively ensnared in this corruption, and may have even instigated it.  But we all know that finding Obama in contempt of Congress or in jeopardy of incarceration will never occur...because he was our first black president, or pseudopresident, as the case may be. One more note on the Manafort break-in:  I am so glad I was not Manafort.  There would have been a large number of federal casualties and one ""dead me"" if anyone broke into my home unannounced."
"Agree Outsider 77, the names are terms of remembrance and admiration to outsiders. 
But maybe they sound and grate to American Indians the way the Nehalem Negroes would likely sound and grate to Black Americans.
At any rate, all groups are presently being emasculated, any aggressive or warlike inference should be removed from American Indians, too."
"""You are an aberration and abomination who is willing to do and say anything — no matter whom it aligns you with and whom it hurts — to satisfy your ambitions."" So, he acted just like Obama (Rev Wright, Black Panthers, etc) did to get elected, but since Trump is a Republican, it's a problem. Give us a break."
"No matter how you try to deflect,  BLM has everything to do with the cops being targeted and killed.  A good amount of them but not all went on rampages, riots and rants claiming that cops were killing black men .......just because.   Save for one or two crooked crazy cop shootings......most were justified.....
BLM let it go to a fever pitch,  after the Dallas shootings they were even out there the very next day with their protesting because they wanted to make sure that the cops knew that it was paybacks....BLM was PROUD of the killings,   BLM is a CULT and a domestic terrorist group."
"Interesting vote you cast there, Alceste.  Seems like your commitment to feminism is only skin deep."
"The pogroms begin.  Who will be next?  Planned Parenthood workers?  Any LBGT?  Any Black, Hispanic, other?  More ""security agents"" to join with the rent-a-cops of Homeland Security created by Bush/Cheney to obey the master Fuehrer to seal the borders in both directions.  Welcome to the Nazi States of America.  Seig Heil!"
I dare say the rich did quite well for themselves in the era of our lord and savior Barry Hussein.  At the same time the middle class had to settle for the crumbs that fell off the table.  And apparently Black Lives didn't matter so much for the first black president as that group was hardest hit during his reign.
"Schatz stop mentioning your Jewish heritage you hate your heritage and you hate Jews your heritage has nothing to do with this, both sides are at fault as trump said today he is right he waited for all the facts to come in before he made his speeches about these violent acts, he was not going to put his foot in his mouth like Obama did a few years ago about a black killing that took place before the facts were in, this was before the Zimmerman incident so trump made a very good speech today about this criminal act that happened over the weekend  you had one Nazi group and you had another group that were paid by Soros to start all this rioting and fighting, since trump won the media and everybody is trying to overthrow this president and our government because Hillary lost that's why anything trump does good the media will condemn it. also the mother of the girl who was killed tweeted trump and thanked him for his speech.  Schatz your speaking out of your you know what very shameful."
"The very legislation that Steve Scalise voted for in Congress made it easier for the mentally ill man with a record of domestic violence who shot him to get a gun.
The police officers who saved his life were a black man and a lesbian woman, both of whom Scalise has voted to take away rights from.


It's not the 'rhetoric' that is the problem, it's unacceptable policies that have to change."
"A ridiculous article. 
...""it was an existential attack on the entire LGBTQ community, particularly gay people of color.""
Ohhh Pleeease! 

As  Xavier_Malcolm stated: ""...we’re not buying into the drama of the BLT-GQ pity party."""
"There is something to be said for presidential honesty.

I mean, as vile as Nazis and their ilk are, surely it is at least something to see trump be honest about his sympathy for the right-wing racists. The guy lies so much and so often - including as part of his justification of his statements - that this almost seems like a breather.

Now if we can get Trump to admit on the podium that what he did with blacks and not renting to them was false.
If we can get Netanyahu in Israel to condemn Trump instead of refusing to 
Jeff Sessions to apologize for his comments about blacks
etc
etc"
"Mr. Harris, like Ms. Moultry, is specifically referring to Ms Shurtz and branding Ms Shurtz's portrayal of Dr. Tweedy as ""willfully ignorant and malicious.""  Those are both extreme descriptions and both phrases ascribe motivation to Ms. Shurtz.  If I believed Ms Shurtz was either one, I'd gladly seek out that petition demanding her resignation or dismissal and sign it myself.  Nothing in her thirty years as a respected professor suggests she's ""willfully ignorant"" about anything.  Did she show poor judgment with her ""black makeup"" in portraying Dr. Tweedy....Indeed, she did.  Was it ""malicious""mockery (as is ""blackface"")? IMO, no, it was part of a well-intentioned effort to honor Dr. Tweedy and promote others reading his book...an effort which went awry because of her using black make-up and doning an Afro wig in her portrayal.  She has issued a (again, IMO) heartfelt apology.

How about a little understanding, compassion and forgiveness. Then let' work together to make things better.."
"So I'm surprised that no one has picked up on the comment about the ""legalized bribery"" claim...if true, are the unions not also participating in ""legalized bribery"" when they contribute to the campaigns of their choice?  Appears to be the kettle calling the pot black!"
"I know there are a lot of people who want payback for what Colin Kaepernick did. They want retribution for a perceived slight. They want it to be true that Colin Kaepernick is having trouble finding a job because for his stance. ""This will teach him...they want to say."" The simple fact of the matter is that Kap has not learned to dominate from the pocket...his skills have eroded and he wants to be paid like a starter. Period. He had trouble getting teams to commit to him BEFORE the protests. Think about it...the NFL is 80% African American. Are the owners stupid enough to black ball a player who was standing up for African Americans? If they thought they had protests before, what do you think would happen if that were the case. The truth is...the owners...most fans...and more importantly the players know....the guy just isn't that good.
The Little Guy"
"Bunkerhill01, I see why this looks bad.  But let's look at the differences.

The bad policing we saw with black Lives Matter was bad policing by local police.

What we saw in Malheur was the FBI trying to avoid another Ruby Ridge.

I think if the FBI was responding to a Black Lives protest, you might have seen better policing.

Likewise, if the Ferguson police force had been put in charge of the Malheur occupation, there would have been a bloodbath.

I don't ""love"" the FBI, but they are smarter and better trained than the underpaid, under trained cops that beat up protestors.

My issue is why the FBI wasn't at the Malheur refuse when the Bundys showed up and why the BLM didn't at least remove computers and heavy equipment.  Live and learn.

But yeah, I share your feelings that a racist religious terrorist like Ammon Bundy seems to get off easy. Lets hope he does a lot of time."
Lol oh please.  If you think an unregulated black market somehow keeps kids safer than a highly regulated market you need to put the beer down and sober up.  That's probably the most ridiculous position anyone could possibly have.
"Remedial President? So, let me see. If you believe this, you must be for the following. High taxes, N.A.F.T.A., carbon taxes, low growth, high debts and deficits, allowing the Chinese government to purchase major American companies, pro transgender men in womens bathrooms, pro illegal immigration, pro war with Russia,and pro preventing Africa advancing economically. Remedial President. O.K."

"I know you people are feeling empowered these days and I actually understand...but perhaps you should come to terms with the reality that you're still in the minority.  The majority of us are actually not hate-filled racist people that compulsively feel the need to label others as subhuman and treat them as such.

By the way...I'd be interested in seeing the ""actual facts"" you have that proves black people do not matter."
"Shizz!!  That an honest, and objective, and dedicated,  South African woman, loyal to her country and to its progress,  should be intimidated and under threat,  is ludicrous.  Crazy-mad. The ANC has gone, and has been replaced by a Mafia.  And that Mafia is now threatening our country, and should be removed by whatever means available.  Why?  Should we have to fight, to get rid of them. They are already criminals, and traitors, and should all be chucked into gaol (or jail),  without any more faffing about. Why, again, are South Africans so scared of taking action against wrongdoers?  Too much intimidation by this Mafia?"
"It’s just a weird series of coincidences based on his not knowing any better that he hired a bunch of Nazis to his staff, won’t distance himself from the Klan, hired Kobach and Hans von Spakovsky and Jeff Sessions and his only governing principle is overturning everything President Black Man did. 

Really, it’s sad because he just means well and is in over his head."
"I really doubt that ""since they were only after Catholics"" that it matters.  Why should they U of O have a monument to ANY member of the Klan?  If you were a person of color, would you want the name of a Klan Leader on a building where you had to go to classes?  The report tried to justify it saying, well he was a ""non-violent Klansman.""  Isn't that a lot like a ""non-violent Nazi?""  If you support the Klan, you are a racist.

As far as Deady goes, he was a racist, sexist, elitist.  Why, if the U of O claims to be ""inclusive and diverse"" would they fight to keep either of these ""monuments"" on their campus?  Again, if you were a person of color, and paying exorbitant tuition to go there, what would you think?  I would think that ""Hey this place is openly racist. It's not like they don't know.""    Certainly there are better people to name buildings after.  If I were a student of color I would be outraged."
"Then Kennedy should not have anything named after him as he was a massive womanizer?   How about Malcolm X and the Black Panthers, their record of hate is well known.   How about Tommy Jefferson, the rapist?  How about Andrew Jackson the founder of the Dem Party?  He really supported slavery.   LBJ put people in ghettos in the guise of helping them."
