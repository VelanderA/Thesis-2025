"Wente's admonition to women to keep their lips together reminds me of Justice Camp's admonition to women to ""keep your knees together."""
"R.R. I think you are on to something; I think the old Rogoff regime kept her around because of her attempts to give off an ""aw shucks, local"" vibe, when in fact the opposite is true. She's just now hearing about Crossfit and Bullet-proof coffee, and then makes a fact-free declaration that they're ""stupid."" She takes the one caller she gets on her show and tries to paint the whole fence with that brush-- whatever that ""fence"" is- she doesn't define it. She'll forever be the girl who really needs to ""get out more"" (no pun intended)."
"Most employers include language similar to ""up to and including termination.""  Not every violation requires termination.  In this case the employer subsists (almost) entirely on government contracts.  Their employee went out of her way to chase down the Presidential motorcade so she could give the President a profane gesture.  Termination seems appropriate in this case."
Uhh .... I'd rather he compared it the other way instead. Usually women are a lot nastier when their husbands are touched. LOL
"Much like Anitfa, the KKK or your other run of the mill criminals, losers or racists, it's understood that if you have something to hide, you cover your face.

Face coverings foment distrust.

Feminists are failing to confront Islamic society's treatment of women - http://nationalpost.com/opinion/robert-fulford-feminists-are-failing-to-confront-islamic-societys-treatment-of-women

""Feminists do a disservice to their sisters in Islam when they ignore practices they would never tolerate in their own lives""

Also, liberals were apoplectic with outrage when Harper introduced legislation to ban face coverings at citizenship swearing in ceremonies, why are liberals not even more outraged at this?

Was that just partisan pap to get elected?  Were liberals not really concerned about women beyond using them for electoral fodder? 

Hmmmm.....I wonder."
"Eh brah, nip the problem before all is utterly lost.  Looks like those boobs were caught chest in time."
"listening: before i was drafted, i was a piece of work. no friends, no woman, no money, strung out. after my ets, people thought i was jesus and asked me for my blessing. beam me up."
Not to mention a very surprised woman! THAT probably is NOT a politically correct statement!!
Those poor women who support Trump want to Make America a Great sexist nation Again.
All Murkowski and Sullivan are doing is trying to cover their own butts. Lisa will now support Pence? Does she have any idea of Pence's abysmal record on women's issues?
"I am sure she can live without your praise of her physical attributes. And she is not a ""girl"", unless misogynistic condescension is the purpose of your comment."
Lottery winner and philanthropist to give women 1k to suture a foreign object made of plastic or metal into their vaginas?
"Catholics who respect and love their faith have every right to be cynical and ""we"" have every right to express our anger, disappointment and, indeed, outrage at the failure of the ""administrators"" and, self-proclaimed ""legitimate teaching authority"" to deal with alacrity, sincerity, and the utmost of transparency and decisiveness in a matter as vital as the abuse of the sexual integrity of children and other vulnerable. 
It is indeed interesting  as it is incongruous, that you relate and compare an issue with regard to women's ""feet"" with the sexual abuse of children. Both the sexual abuse of children and the exclusion and diminution of women are expressions of the abuse of authority by patriarchal clericalists - whether sick or demented, whether simply ""ontologically other"" who knew and denied, or  the ""fullness of ontological otherness"" who have known, facilitated, turned a ""blind eye"" and/or denied, obfuscated and demeaned victims, and those who sought and seek to cleanse and heal."
I have no doubt that she needs serious help and she may be mentally ill.  But there are a lot of things she could be besides mentally.
"ANY woman who goes to a concert, there are  MANY that  are just to plain CRAZY over these bands and performers.   Many  go there with the INTENTIONS  of being  invited backstage, or into the Luxury Band Bus, or Hotel,  after the concert to party with the band or performers.   This is a very RISKY,  DICEY and IGNORANT decision on your part.  I say, ""YOU get what you deserve by doing this"".  It is a LONG time known  fact that after their  performance,  Bands LOVE to drink ALCOHOL, use DRUGS,  and of course, pick out a woman and have Sexual Intercourse.  

Just ask any of the Band Members in the Cherry Poppin Daddies Band, they have taken pride in publicly stating that this is how they named their band.  W O W........."
"Judge ought to also make him wear a sign that reads: I molested 12 helpless women in the retirement home I own! And make him stand on a busy street corner for say, 12 days.  Spending only 2 days in jail is nothing for what he did."
"Boils down to this, moral compass.  Kaine has none and Pence does.  Can't draw that same conclusion to the presidential candidates as much.  If you compare Clinton's lack of a moral compass combined with her incompetency's (telling the truth, attacking sexual abuse victims, Benghazi, cyber security and protecting top secret information, First Lady of health care, choice of a husband)  and the Trumpsters lack of a moral compass combined with his incompetency's (narcissism, boasting, exaggerating, name calling, cheating on his wife, poor taste in hair style) what do you have left?  Who will be better protect the national security of our nation (lead with strength on the national stage, elimination of radical muslim terrorist, secure the borders and enforce the laws of the land) and getting people back to work?  Trumpster.  (For one year until he resigns due to health reasons caused by hairspray poisoning and then Pence.)"
"Nan, you are demeaning women who think differently than you do, saying if they think that way there must be something wrong with them. Think about that."
Can we give them my ex-wife's address?
"the inquiry cannot make the outcome FN wants, that is the problem. They want facts twisted so they can point fingers.  Harper, as much of a jerk he was, knew the truth and didnt want to WASTE tax money on something they already knew.  The bloody Royal Commission report on Aboriginal Peoples in 1995 said same thing, too much abuse on reserves, too much sexual assault and domestic violence against women."
"I'd really love to see the City or EWEB contribute to the relocation costs for the non-profit EWEB Child Development Center before they tear it down and replace it with townhouses. The land subject to redevelopment is NOT ALL VACANT. When the CDC shuts down, that'll cost about 20 women their jobs. And that Center has been serving our community by providing the highest quality daycare to Eugene's children for decades."
"Thanks so much, Julie!  Your thoughtfulness and efficiency is going to give me an excellent resource.  I urge your readers to research the Equal Rights Amendment and set aside a little time each week to lobby Sen. Grassley R (IA) inthe Senate Judiciary Committee.  Also:  I just noticed the library here in Coupeville had a meeting ""Women's March Meeting.""  hAVE YOUROWN MEETING WHERE YOU ARE.
WE ARE RISING!!!"

"A ""comfortable"" lead? Nope. Did she win, yep.  But notice she distanced herself from Trump during her campaign. Why do you think that is?"
"Lesbian nuns arise! Demand equal mistreatment, now!!!"
"Come on, Kat, how could you know that? Are you simply justifying your own view of the woman and the situation? Tell the truth, now."
"This women will one day wake up and find she is not welcome in Trumps world.  Trump and the gop will control the house, senate and the white house, they will model the US after Kansas which is a financial disaster.  This women will find out she will have to pay 1k a month for health insurance with a 20k deductable.
    When the gop finally destroy the economy, they will blame it on entitlements like social security and medicare and steal them from us.
  A sad day of reckoning is awaiing many people, they will find out, if you are a corporation, things will be great, but the working person will find out they will be paying for all the coming corporate give aways and systems/ programs they paid into their entire life will be taken away from them."
Hard to believe that the woman wearing a hat in the lower left hand corner of the photo actually had the nerve to stand on the street in a bathing suit with a body like that.  Somebody please put a bathrobe on her  and let her know that when you look like that it's time to cover up.
"And btw--yes, this is not a ""girl"" problem. Your words are so true and should be taken to heart. We, as a society and we as parents, need to stop doing this."
"""One thing is Clear"" THIS LADY WANTS ALL YOUR MONEY!"
"The term ""barbaric cultural practices"" was indeed a bad choice of words, but not because it ""perpetuates the bigoted connotation that all Muslims either practice or support female genital mutilation"", it does not. 

It was a bad choice because it fuels emotional overreactions, always a bad idea on either side. The idea of a hotline, however, was not a bad one. We have hotlines for all kinds of social problems, why not one to help girls who might be struggling with the issue?

Trudeau was hardly the first to talk about ""root causes"", either. But there are root causes for Bissonnette as much as for Muslim radicalisation."
"It confirms nothing of the kind.   Have you forgotten about the dossier on Trump?  The peeing one?  'Russian female agents peeing on Trump ' in a secretly recorded video. Well, do you?  Of course they would like something more on HRC, as corrupt as she already is, every little bit helps."
"So, I'm a mother of one. I struggle to make rent, pay bills, buy food and necessities. Why not let law biding citizens like me rent an apartment for $450.  I live smack dab next to this place, and I do not like the idea of ex-cons moving into the area. So many kids at play in our complex and at the park, and to me this is going to make it unsafe for our kids. What are the the people behind this complex thinking? Obviously their kids don't play here."
I don't understand why young girls have to cover up like that.
Actually there is a risk of low birth weight and other complications when a pregnant woman smokes cannabis during pregnancy.
"""to me, the biggest issue is getting qualified female and minority candidates to apply.""

Universities share your pain, when it comes to Chairs in certain areas of study and research. The submission process is open to all. They just don't get the response from young females.  Our own Minister of Science fails to see this.  She bashes the universities.  What she needs to do is understand the wants and desires--the predilections, if you wish--of young women today.  Ironic, eh?"
"Speaking only for myself, just because I oppose Trump doesn't mean I support Hillary.  They were both terrible candidates.  I do think Hillary would have been more sympathetic to women's issues, but I had serious doubts about her in other areas."
"Let us ask ourself the question concerning equality:-
Are my civil rights equal to yours or are they identical to yours?
The law says that the sum of my civil rights ought to equal the sum of your civil rights, not one more, not one less. They also must be the same rights, in other words they must be identical as well in every way.
However, I agree with you that there is a subtle difference between equal and identical. So far, however, I have not come across any argument in favour of the ordination of women where the word ‘equal’ is not synonymous with ‘identical’."
"Scam university - No Problem 

Cheating 3,500 contractors - No Problem 

Being illiterate - No Problem 

Pandering to the KKK - - No Problem 

Groping women - No Problem 

Boasting about groping women - No Problem"
"Matthew 26 and Mark 14 explicitly say that only the Twelve were at table with Jesus as He instituted the Eucharist. Luke 22 explicitly says the Apostles were at table with Him. No disciples present at the Last Supper in the synoptics. In John 13-17 the only disciples mentioned were those among the Twelve (Peter, Judas, Beloved Disciple/John, Thomas, and Phillip). Gospels clearly indicate only the Twelve (aka no women) present at the table. 

The Acts 2 passage refers to explicitly refers to the community centered entirely around the teaching and ministry of the Apostles in Jersualem immediately following Pentecost. The easiest reading of the text suggests the Apostles are present in all events mentioned. Particularly the breaking of the bread.

The ""wait on tables' phrase you mention in Acts 6 refers directly to visiting widows' homes and not the Eucharist.

And yes, Peter was married but clearly had left his wife to follow the Lord. My reference was to current Church discipline."
LAST do you question the women who only recently came forward about Bill Cosby?  Meanwhile it appears the acquisitions those women have made have resulted in court actions years after they happened.
"It just seems to me that given her senior role and knowledge of its inner workings, it is jarring that such strong action is taken for something that looks not particularly serious especially in the context of the board's history of inaction against those accused of stealing billions from the company."
"Yeah, like ""driving drunk"" is an acceptable excuse for molesting lone women on the trail
killing a beautiful Iditarod dog (my condolences Mr. King) or any other sorry excuse for your infantile actions. I hope the judge throws  the book at you, all of you."
Even up the playing field. Teach a female how to drop a 200 pound attacker hard. This is way overdue.
"Question: Was George Washington a traitor? answer (this ones from Quara) ""Yep. He was a subject of the British Empire. He spoke with a British accent. He fought for the British as an officer in the French & Indian Wars - meaning he commanded British troops.

His father was British. His grandfather went to school in Great Britain. His great-grandfather was born there. His ancestors were from Washington, Tyne & Wear in England. The ancestoral home — (which still exists) is Washington Old Hall (now a UK National Trust Property). He never visited England but that wasn’t unusual in colonial days. If the British had captured him before the general agreement around the Declaration of Independence, he would have been put on trial and almost certainly hanged as a traitor (they may have spared his wife)."" Does that answer your question? There are dozens of other sites which present the same answer.... You seem to miss the fact that Washington led ""our"" insurrection...very big difference. GCrum"
This attempt to make the two sides morally equivalent is all very well until one remembers that Trump's alt-right supporters literally murdered a woman in the streets.
"Amazing woman, tough circumstances.  She will be missed on the school board but glad to see her take the time to do what's right for her family.  Sending good vibes her way."
"How do I know you are a  Latino for Trump? 
But I agree, Trump is nothing like Hitler. He just has some similar but less intense statements about immigrants, women and Muslims."
"I still content that DT is alive only because he never met the right woman. Obviously, Weinstein is a similar case. More women should carry concealed weapons, and use them. I know I do and would."
"Poor John Tory , under the Impression that he had taxation powers to enact public policy. John should know that the good folks of Ontario are Kathleen's slaves not his. She and only she shall fleece the chained.

"She might not ""deserve"" anybody's votes, but you are also voting for a lot of other outcomes besides just ""for"" a person, such as Supreme Court nominations, cabinet appointments, judicial appointments, how the DOJ, EPA, and other federal agencies are run, etc.  She also holds the veto pen assuming Republicans manage to keep hold of the Senate, the House, or both.

Your high and mighty ""principles"" aren't worth shit when you're dealing with the reality of a disjunctive choice between the two major party nominees in this election cycle.

It's also beyond condescending for you to tell black people who does and does not deserve their votes - I'm pretty sure black people are fully capable of figuring that out for themselves and voting accordingly."
"I'm not asking for the state to do anything but get out of the marriage business and it's (again) nothing to do with religious zealouts, who want the exact opposite.

You neglect anti-miscegeny laws, anti-adultery laws, anti-sodomy laws, not letting women vote or own property in their own names and more. 

You should refrain from pretending you know what I think on any topic I haven't discussed. You keep presenting statements that make it clear you think I am anti-muslim. Time to stop."
"Lynn: 

I wouldn't place too much faith in polls this early in the race. And if you believe that both Clinton and Trump are political equivalents then I would assume you believe the rich pay too little in taxes, millions should be rounded up and deported, women's access to reproductive healthcare should be constrianed, too many people have health insurance, climate change is a scam peddled by the Chinese, we should apply religious tests to immigrants, candidates shouldn't show their tax returns, and the biggest problems that schools face is too few guns in the classroom."
"Before this weekend: no meetings “were set up” with Russians
Saturday: just a “short introductory meeting” about adoption policy
Sunday: “An individual who I was told might have information helpful to the campaign”
Tuesday: “The woman...was not a government official,” and her information wasn’t helpful anyway."
"I understand your view and appreciate it.  It's just that I arrived some time ago at the same position that Cael mentions.
I don't see all movement as good movement.  Some movement serves to temporarily appease at least some among those who are not accorded full rights, with the intention of dividing them and weakening their position.
If such an advisory panel were to be created, then the hierarchy could and would say that they were listening to women, that women now had a say in the process, and that the question of ordination was moot.  If the advisory panel were to advise against such a position, well, we all know what happens when an advisory panel in the Catholic Church does not say what the powers that be want to hear.
Movement towards equality is good.  Movement to sidestep and prevent equality is not good in my view.  I see this proposal as the latter."
"Clearly she's not calling out all white settlers as a ""monolithic evil"" since she acknowledged the example set by that white Toronto lawyer who, instead of being drawn into the debate, started fundraising for an aboriginal writing prize."
I don't know if Charles is asking us to vote 3rd party since Trump is a predator and Clinton is a woman who demonized women  making similar claims against her own husband. If Charles is serious then he knows that denial is at the root of our difficulties in eradicating this kind of behavior. This is too important and issue to be merely used as a prop when it benefits your candidate but ignored when it is an inconvenient fact. In any event I long ago decided a vote for Johnson-Weld was one I could make and still look in the mirror.
"Here's to ya ladies, your winners no matter what. Best of luck👏🏻"
"Neither.  I have no disdain for dogs at all.  It's halal (Islamically lawful) for Muslims to own dogs, and many do.  And I have.  The fact I don't have one now is because after losing my last one to old age, I couldn't bear to get another because I didn't think I'd ever find one to compare to her; GASP!--a highly-esteemed FEMALE dog!  How disappointed you must be at my sloppily murdering your cherished stereotype!  On what will you predicate your sanctimoniousness now?  (Apologies to Thomas Henry Huxley, aka ""Darwin's Bulldog"").

Her name was 'Kuma', BTW.  Japanese for 'bear'.

Next question."
Our women's auxiliary at the Church had a corrections officer speak to us one day. Due to the high number of Jamaican inmates they all become pretty conversant with that patols so they know when bad stuff is about to take place. He also told us about hand signs and that when they suck their teeth it means a bad word. It was all quite interesting while at the same time being scary.
""" She was using the car as a destructive, deadly weapon with no regard for human life! ""

Dude: The article said no such thing.  There were only two customers inside the store.  

This woman is definitely emotionally unstable, though.  She may suffer from some serious mental disorders."
"Ever wonder why the press has little credibility?
For many years, Margaret Wente, like John Ibbitson, was a conservative, Her values were American values. She loved Stephen Harper.
  Only when most of Canada turned against Harper and elected Trudeau did she and Ibbitson start trumpeting ""liberal values"".

One other point: The Obama-Hillary administration were waging war, invading, occupying, and droning those seven Islamic  nations. Since when does a nation invite the enemy into its country?"
"Values like racial tolerance? Curiosity? Scientific truth? Respect of women? Kindness to the weak?(i.e. ""losers"") 
Not sure what values you're talking about here. If you mean values like segregation, misogyny, arrogance, ignorance, hatred, racism, provincialism, isolationism, jingoism....oh! 

Make America Hate Again!!"
"I'm a progressive pragmatic without a fundamentalist streak...I wish Al Gore has been president. And while centrist Hillary is just that, the closest we have is getting her in the White House and hearing more from the progressive young guns...or maybe you should be working to get Peter as secretary of transportation. Obama has a few progressives and this is the farm team...sorry. Of course we could simply keep wishing and complain about the Bushian/Trumpian view again, and hope there is a world to reclaim....climate change, social security, health care, wage reform, banking reform will all go down the toilet it you don't campaign and vote for our first female president, think for. Moment what that'll mean to young females, our best leaders....humm."
Seriously.  She is a WOMAN!  Women do things differently and holding the accountable is sexist and racist.
"This was not an issue between him and his wife. 

""The Duggars, whose family stars in TLC’s popular reality show “19 Kids and Counting,” spoke about the _multiple incidents of molestation_ that occurred in their Arkansas home.

"Gary, speaking for myself, I have posted over and over I will not vote for Trump or Hillary. Yes, ""character matters"" as does principle, again from the start I have refused to crawl into gutter with either one. Trumps locker room language merits no defense.

However, here is another problem with being in the partisan gutter you have chosen. For example: ""However, Donaly Trump, especially in the just exposed audio/visual record of his comments regarding women, makes Bill look like a ""choir boy.""  That statement is completely absent of fact.

The factual history of Bills known infidelity issues is by far greater then Trumps known admissions. Also with Bill's record of infidelity issues, comes the hypocrisy of Hillary and her personal character assignation and harassment of some 30 plus women victimized  by Bill. And that does not account for Bills [sic] actions with under age females with his friend Epstein."
Wow kanak!  Did you marry a tita or what?  Then you encounter the female sarge from hell.  What an evening you had!  My wife is a small gal so the most damage she did was tear down the Christmas tree one year when I got a gift from another woman.  Roflmao!
"I was actually there.

What is the point of this law? You can obtain an exemption based on religious grounds. Women who choose to wear a niqab do so based on religious grounds. So I really do not understand what this law is intended to achieve. Do you really need a law to ask people to remove their sunglasses to verify identity? How many people wear sunglasses indoors when talking to public staff (apart from Bono)?
"A ""ballerina"" is the principle female dancer of a ballet company. It's not a generic term for anything in a tutu."
"Ah, but you see, there is one thing that logic, math and common sense cannot defeat.  And, that is a national narrative by this particular group of 'higher thinking' people.  They have their agenda and the former conditions don't apply.  They know what they want, and until they get it, they won't quit.  So, your son can be brilliant, but until the sisterhood gets what they want, which is control, too bad for him. Of course, Sunny Dazes, our PM, being a feminist will just calmly sit back, because it doesn't affect him."
"I see his point, Lee. It's not about fear, it's about being prepared. I learned all about that as  young woman in an abusive situation, and being prepared to take action to defend myself probably saved my life. But Ransom's point, I believe, is that everyone has the right to defend themselves, no just young women."

"I am also confused, particularly since what I've gleaned from news reports is a long, long history of sexual harassment of female employees that ultimately, and I agree for financial reasons alone, resulted in these firings.  Maybe Mr. Briggs doesn't think sexual harassment at work has been (apparently is still) a significant problem for women at work.  

This article seemed frighteningly reminiscent of bygone days in terms of  the ""she's fair game"" syndrome many of us fought so hard against -- and I thought won."
"Talk about partisan censorship happening on this board.

I submitted a post pointing out that, at the level of US Presidents, both Clinton and Kennedy would be better examples than Trump because, historically, they are known to have coerced young women, through their massive power imbalances, to, um, perform acts right there in White House while working there. Those are historical facts that no historian disputes. Trump, in contrast, made his noted infamous and inexcusable comments in a bus in Hollywood, years before being elected.

A perfectly civil comment, a perfectly history-based observation.

And it got blocked.

You have got to be kidding me..."
"Totally agree. In what little I heard of his talk on video, he just talked about himself and how great he is. It's like he commissioned a study to see what the 3 most hot-button issues are that will bring people to the poles and focuses on them. He lacks even the tiniest bit of sincerity or humility. His ""I love women"" and ""I love Hispanics"" couldn't be more insincere and shallow, nor could his ideas on running the country."
"And people accuse the Beeb of looking feminine.... it sounds like you are struggling to process a slightly out-of-the-norm (for you) visual.

Most people don't like being called ""it""."
"It's been about 15 years since I read the book but it seemed to me at the time that the actual transition and mechanism of that transition from a Democratic government to Gilead was pretty sketchy in the story. I didn't think it was all that plausible (essentially Christian fanatics just machine gun Congress and POOF - United States of Saudi Arabia).

But regardless of whether or not you think the story was plausible, the connection with Donald Trump is lost on me. I can think of few politicians who have less in common with Gilead as described in HT as Trump. In fact, he is pretty much the antithesis of what Gilead represents. I can only presume that the comparison is just a very thinly veiled rehash of the ""war on women"" rehetoric that's been leveled against the Republicans for years. It has pretty much nothing to do with Trump, who is a sexist boor, but as far from a fundamentalist Christian misogynist as... well... ummm... anyone, ever."
What a great way to spend summer vacations. Jillian is fortunate that she is affluent enough to be able to afford the $3000 to $6000 to participate in Adventure Treks programs.

"Wow.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.  We need more stories like this.  I remember having lunch with some work friends and one woman complaining about her boss.  A few minutes layer someone spoke about a sexual harassment and the first woman said “I’m really lucky something like that has navel happened to me”.  She realized, as quickly as the rest of us, her denial.  It’s a bizarre experience, and our coping mechanisms can be equally bizarre.  Thanks to this writer and my sorrow for your experience."
"Mike I have worked the political side...it's not some hierarch who states his position...it's down in the ditches and constant effort at the local and state or federal level by loads of people to convince a legislator that his days may be numbered..if he or she does not protect the healthcare of 24 million people or lots of other possible arguments to be made in this ""trump era""....it's absolutely critical that the Indivisible and Move On folks are doing this...and there are loads of folks joining them who have never done this before but are scared and learning how! At the Women's March right after the inauguration a very large percentage of folks had NEVER been engaged in a political action prior to that first demonstration....folks at the airports to protect immigrants, folks on April 15 relative to tax issues, folks and innumerable other marches..here and abroad ....

You didn't vote for Obama in 2008 nor in 2012. Racism may not have been your reasoning but for many folks in 2016 a very strong anti-Obama (racist) attitude prevailed as well as a misogynistic attitude toward the candidate who happen to have been a woman. These same people voted for McCain and Romney and then came out in droves for Trump. I reject the idea that Obama voters turned to Trump. He won (with Putin's help of course) because too many of Obama's voters stayed home rather than vote for Clinton (probably 70K).

Politics inevitably involves moral choices: whether to go to war; to extend the Voting Rights Act; to pay for a new missile system rather than WIC supplements, etc. etc.  Why should moral act with life or death consequences --- literally --- be ""dissociated"" from politics?  Answer:  To leave it on the table will continue to reduce progressives' chances at the polls.  This country is still divided by the Court's decision in Roe v. Wade, a decision that unconstitutionally took the decision whether allow abortion away from the states.  One of the country's great legal scholars, who knows legal BS when he sees it, wrote a ""famous"""
"Ultimately, IMHO, yes. Just as Yahweh remained utterly faithful to Israel, despite her considerable lapses, so to I believe the Spirit will remain faithful to her holy people of God; and within that community, I accept the sacrament of orders as selecting the episcopal college for the charism of teaching.

That said, I think we have to distinguish three magisteria: bishops as a college, theologians as a college, and the people as a whole. Presently the three are obviously not in sync, and my money is on the bishops as the magisterium that our future will identify as having been in error about the big ticket items (women priests, married clergy, sexual ethics) that rile Catholics in western countries. 

It is critically important, IMHO, to know about the iconoclast controversy in this regard. Back then, at one point the majority of bishops in council were on what history established to have been the wrong side. The people disagreed, for the most part, and were proved correct."
"None of these other religions force women to wear scarves or cover themselves.  None of these other religions murders gays and lesbians.
None of these other religions treats women as second class subjects."
"Only women get abortions, and when they do so, they are not taken up with philosophical arguments about life in a petri dish or extraterrestrial sightings. Suggesting that the two perspectives overlap or essentially have anything to do with each other is a perfect example of how the pro-life contingent has yet to locate the actual issue: why women seek abortions."

"20 years ago, she suffered with bulimia."
This is a complete travesty of justice.  This woman was interfering with the food supply.  Who knows what these far left 'activists' will put in their bottles next.  This judge failed to protect the public from this criminal and should be ashamed.  We need better judges with actual brains and not more left wing activists on the bench.

"The cigarette tax in Oregon is $1.31 on a $5.35 pack of Marlboros.  I think that is about 32% tax.  The weedies are getting a deal based on that figure.   Those of us who are virtuous  (or at least smart enough) to not use either substance can only cheer!  Alcohol, Tobacco, Marijuana, tax it all!  Increase the taxes!   Now let's talk about Nevada and the money which can be made by legalizing prostitution and taxing it.  Women have absolute control over their bodies (see Roe v. Wade); prohibiting them from making money with their bodies is therefore unconstitutional.  Pimps, child abuse, drugging girls into prostitution, and all that stuff still needs to be totally illegal and I think mandatory sentencing is appropriate.  But.  For those women who wish to make money in that fashion it should be legal and taxed."
This in no way should be interpreted as an indicator of the wider culture. Let's get back to how women are oppressed in NA.
"I don't blame him one bit.  I refuse to support her if she is elected.  How can anyone support someone who cannot seem to tell the truth and takes money from countries who abuse women and gays.  She said she didn't know what the ""c"" meant in classified emails?  Really?  Either she is lying or she is too ignorant to be our president."
"It is sad what happened to the goat but another part of this story bothers me.     
""The animal's remains were given to a local charity.""  I don't think you can just leave this out there without more info.  Did the charity want the remains? Was it voluntary? Because leaving a dead goat on the doorstep of the Boys and Girls Club in the middle of the night is not cool. What was the charity? If it was the local Greek orthodox church, also not as cool. They are having a picnic this weekend. Not charity. You need to be specific. Homeless people will be eating haunted, drowned goat soon--yes?"

"The cons always seem to be angry about every thing. Probably a function of watching ""news"" that keeps them perpetually aggrieved about non-existent issues.


I watched them get even ANGRIER after their pResident supposedly ""won"" the election. Why did they get angrier? Who knows? Maybe because not everyone in the country dropped to the ground and started praising this loser game show host.


Certainly on platforms with little to no moderation, the expressions of hostility and violence went off the charts. I think some of it was because some angry white types thought that tRump's ""election"" now empowers them to act just like they've always wanted to act: threaten certain race/religions with being ""shoved in ovens"", threatening ""uppity"" women with rape, expressing violent fantasies involving murdering/torturing liberals, or really, anyone that doesn't support Dear Leader, etc."
"Libby,

What if the prospective judge 'feels like' a female? Would She/he then pass your 'gender test'?"
"As always doc, an astute comment. Empowering females is more important to the Trudeau Liberal/left/progressives than saving the lives of their children. An odd priority to say the least."
"Privileged women have obvious and legitimate self-interest in trying to ensure women's control over their own fertility. But social justice will require much more of the privileged than that they share their birth control, and historically it doesn't appear that there's been much willingness to pay those costs. I am optimistic that we are in a moment when that willingness is increasing,  and I'd hope that raising these matters would help a little, to that end. 

Absent an equally fervent commitment to social justice, criticisms of birth control as bearing a eugenic taint will, unfortunately, continue to have some legitimacy. That's just baked in, for as long as society discourages and de-values the lives of poor people of color on every other front.

Anyway, that's how it seems to me. All the best."
"""Perhaps it is too simple to understand, or many don't want to accept it, that many fundamentalist Christians (as is true of zealots in any cause) have as their real objective, to exercise control and domination over others.""  Are you including as ""zealots"", in a partial list of issues that evoke strong emotions, proponents of gay marriage, gun control, forced birth control included in company provided health insurance, those demanding removal of any religious symbols such as the 10 Commandments from public buildings, mandatory minimum wage increases and those advocating removal of any Confederate symbols in your list?"
"Come on... :-)... pigs flying in heaven and/or snowballs frozen in hell are neither necessary nor sufficient for women to be priests and bishops...

Going back to our current dialogue, this is a more reasonable scenario:  

St JP2 will get together with us and explain what were his *real* intentions in publishing Ordinatio Sacerdotalis.  Then he will smile and say, ""isn't it awesome  how a Pope can write an irrational *executive order* for ""the glory of God and the good of souls""?  And what about the silly *fake news* published afterwards by the CDF in response to people's incredulity?  Wasn't that an amazing exercise in creating ecclesiastical confusion?  Ah, but even though holy people can make mistakes, the Spirit persists until reason and sanity prevail, for the real glory of God and the real good of souls!""

Then, comfortably sitting in our heavenly balcony, we shall enjoy seeing white smoke coming out of the Vatican and the senior cardinal deacon crying...

"Thank you, Rock - I puzzle over it too....and the gang mentality it fosters.  

And you are right - silly, nasty comments should just roll of my back.  I have always had a problem with unfairness and arrogance, and I am more like a female Don Quixote tilting at windmills when it comes to that.  I am of Irish heritage and a Scorpio - so I tend to dig in.  I should just make my observation and let them have at it.  In the long run, it would be those posters look mean-spirited and diminish their position.  

But - you are right.  Better to discuss what can be discussed with the rational people here rather than try to correct lifetime patterns of behavior in others.  I'm thinking your three and done rule may be a good idea....."

"Exactly. She's ultimately not a particularly good representative or salesperson for equality.

You can't hire investigators to harass and dig up dirt on the women accusing your husband in the 1990s and then come back 15 years later and speak with any kind of authority on sexual assault or sexual harassment legislation. You can't call yourself a strong woman when you chose political expediency and kept your marriage alive rather than kick Bill to the curb for his philandering. You can't say that you're the candidate for fairness and equality when your campaign took apart a lifelong feminist in Bernie Sanders, with the party's complicity, claiming his supporters were sexist boors.

Her principled adherence to equality and fairness is about a mm thin, and underneath that veneer was a total political machine, willing to say and do just about anything to advance. People just saw past that mask to the ugliness underneath."

"I understand the sensitivities of some folks but, how far do we carry this? There are people putting up signs on their property that they won't serve Muslims. You have people who won't serve inter-racial couples. You have people who wouldn't serve an unwed mother in cases where they knew. When we make it lawful for business persons to discriminate against anyone that tickles their religious fancy, where does it stop? And another thing: Businesses use public safety, sanitation, roads to carry in produce and customers, water systems, and on and on, that are payed for by ALL citizens, not just the ones they agree with. They don't seem to mind using the services paid for by everyone's money but they don't want to serve those same people whose money they are using? I think that's a form of theft!"
"So, Your Eminence, Trump has ""convinced"" you, has he? That's wonderful. But tell me, just how did he do it?

Was it his longstanding record on pro-life issues? Was it his deep respect for human sexuality and his demonstrated moral temperance? How about the profound respect he has always shown for women and his demonstrated concern for their well-being?

No? It wasn't any of those things? Well then, what was it? Oh, I see. He said it when he decided to run for president. Of course, makes perfect sense.

If you don't mind my saying so, I think your zuchetto might be a bit too tight. Just sayin'."

"Bereft of any argument Alceste concedes defeat by resorting to ad hominem attacks.  Unfortunately not a surprise. But it is a continuing display of how 3rd wave feminists deal with dissent. As I said, no wonder so many women are refusing to be labelled as feminists - they've seen what modern feminism is about and they don't want to be associated with it."
"Bear - I was following along a series of questions asked by another commenter that were focused on late term abortion and seemed more concerned with what we are doing here in the U.S. than what is happening in El Salvador.  Conversations wander.  I don't think my comment is any more out-of-line than many other comments in this thread.  

What is happening in El Salvador regarding abortion is horrible.  There are no exceptional circumstances recognized under law which would allow an abortion - no abortion in case of rape or incest, to protect the life/health of the mother, no abortion if there are fetal defects.  This is the Catholic bishops dream - women as cows.  This is the kind of law that only works when the world is perfect, when there is no rape, when a pregnancy never threatens the life or health of a woman.    

We have to remain vigilent here so we do not turn back the clock the way El Salvador did in the late 1990's and is threatening to happen in Poland.

Satisfied?"

"Exposure to Canadian Secular Education make the children of immigrants less prone to following the superstition of their parents.

You also give immigrants too little credit. Many have come to Canada to escape Theocratic oppression. They are eager to exert their Right to Freedom From Religion in Canada.

Sikhs in Canada bring tables and chairs into Temples, finding themselves slashed in the head (recorded on video) by the ""Ceremonial"" Kirpans of hardliners. Sort of like the Catholic reaction to Martin Luthor and other protestants.

Canada is being very slow about extraditing the conspirators who had a young woman killed after she refused to go along with family wishes about who she would marry. That is tied up with youth not falling for the Old Time Religion of their immigrant parents.

"<Number one reason year after year for abortion? I don't want a baby now...it would be inconvenient at this time.>
Even if that were true - it isn't, but even if it were - that would not justify the distortion of the views of people who disagree with you; and it surely would not justify policies that drive up the number of abortions (spontaneous and direct) as well as the numbers of women who die from lack of adequate pre-and post-natal medical care and the number of children who die in infancy.
According to WebMD, the leading reason for abortions is the failure of birth control. (Many - not all, for sure, but many - in the pro-life movement oppose birth control.) Simple convenience is the third leading cause. The WebMD article is here: http://www.webmd.com/women/tc/abortion-reasons-women-choose-abortion
Again: even if you were right that the leading cause of abortion is convenience: What strategy or policy does that suggest to you regarding a way to discourage or decrease abortions?"

"That was the worst broadcast I have seen/heard in all my years of watching the NFL.  The audio was atrocious.  I mean, it could have been a library they were calling the game from.  I could barely hear the audio, period.  Nothing against the female announcer who does a better job with baseball - - but the monotone voices and lack of energy - - you would have been better off listening to KOA if you could sync the audio to the video.  Unacceptable and a real black eye on ESPN, IMHO."
The hypocrisy of this incompetent woman and her cabinet knows no bounds.

"Exclusion has never worked. The wall that is constructed now along the Mexican border is ineffective because it (or any other) will never work. You need to go to the mountains, rivers and deserts that simply cannot be walled.  PP gets government grants and reimbursements for the services that are provided to women.  This ""wall"" is going to cost a lot more than the $500,000,000 that is reimbursed to the affiliates that actually provide the services. You are barking up the wrong tree. How about lowering the subsidies and tax incentives to the oil industries? Now, there you could actually collect about 37.5 BILLION. Think about it!"

Furthermore, I point out that Swift did not initiate the legal action. She merely reported the misbehavior to Mueller's employer, who decided that no, they didn't want a groper on their staff and showed him the door. He got all bent out of shape about it and filed a suit against her for lost wages over his inability to get work in the industry. The only reason Swift got any money at all is she countersued for all of $1, in order to highlight this creep's shitty behavior before a judge and jury on national TV.

"Lizzy - 

At the heart of the case that you wrote this article about - Whole Woman's Health vs Hellerstedt making it to the Supreme Court - What several law makers want is SAFETY/PROTECTION for the patients.

You mention colonoscopies being more fatal - but there are several million invasive colonoscopy scopes performed just in texas every year - - While only 70,000 - 80,000 abortions are performed in texas every year.

Imagine if, instead of the tens of thousands per state for abortions - the tens of millions of patients per state could show up with little to no previous medical history, screening, education, pre or post service assistance programs - no emergency care relationships, no emergency care facilities..

You really want less safety for patients?"

"Defunding PP is not going to make them close their doors.  They are not taking abortion away it's the law they are not changing that law.  Simply defunding a private company ""Planned Parenthood"" who provide about 300 thousands abortion a year and they sell body parts (that's illegal and that's why they are being defunded) won't close their doors.   Women in the US have many choices besides PP.   The money will go to those other clinics."

"Today there seems to be great consternation among some,about the protest of African American people, and athletes. I have heard it called unamerican, disrespectful , even bigoted. It is sad that we have not grown more as a country. The post racial society that many dreamed of has failed to materialize.Quite frankly we are still the country where more than 80 percent of white America opposed women's right to vote. The country where 75 percent of white America, thought that The civil rights protest were wrong. And once again white America , or at least 82 percent of Republicans think these protest are wrong."
"Annie, the Pauline privilege concerns only marriages contracted between non-Christians or between a Christian and a non- Christian. To this day such marriages are considered to be natural marriages and not sacramental marriages; the couples not being joined together by God therefore divorce is possible.
There are strict rules on this. Natural marriages cannot be considered dissolved on the say-so of one spouse, both have to agree to the dissolution. In the situation of a baptised Christian being married to an unbeliever, the baptised Christian can only remarry (in favour of the faith) another Christian."

"I have a suggestion. Washington, D.C. has seen many marches in recent years. Most are forgotten. To make the march memorable and more historic, imagine photographs and YouTube videos of women encircling The White House with their backs turned toward it.

"Nice Clinton promo piece and Trump hit piece. Starts out as a story  about how Oregon doesn't matter but oddly pivots to a politics and gender piece.

The media is making such a big deal of the Cubs winning for the first time since 1945, much as they make a big deal of the potential first woman president. But the Cubs simply played a phenomenal game last night that is worthy of spotlighting even if they had won 10 straight titles (one player even downplayed the drought in his post-game interview). If Hillary were to win, she actually has no substance worth spotlighting. The woman card only goes so far; trumped by her crimes, she is by no means a lock to win Oregon or any state."

No, actually I think Meryl Streep is great, an excellent actress, and her speech was incredible. I just think it's counterproductive to make the whole Trump thing about women - which is what the ""women's marches"" are doing. He's dangerous to everyone.

Think back to Clinton's campaign. She did not campaign on issues.. she merely portrayed herself as the anti-Trump, and let him define the campaign. It was supposed to work.. it didn't. Her only qualification, back when she began campaigning and resume-building in 2000, was that she was a woman who had survived the worst a Republican Congress could throw at her.

"If deacons aren't intended to replace priests, why is the gender of deacons even relevant?

"A more compelling Italian comparison, I think, is Benito Mussolini who, as Wikipedia notes, ""dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship."" What we're witnessing with Trump is much more akin to that. The question remains as to whether we as a people will arrest his autocratic rise after he succeeds in demonizing the media, or be blind to it as the Italians were with Mussolini or the Germans were with Hitler. 

The other day I was watching a show about the Third Reich and a Jewish writer chronicling Hitler's rise to power said watching the Germans embrace Hitler was like watching people who were in a trance together. Vintage video of a Hitler rally then focused on one particularly Aryan-looking woman who looked as if she was indeed in a führer-induced trance. That image has haunted me ever since. 

With Trump we're witnessing the normalization of extremism, and a willing populace, willfully blind to the truth, is once again being seduced into a collective trance."

However, it was the Fascists and not the Progressives who carried this concept to its ugliest extreme in simply destroying all those the system regarded as inferior, often starving them to .death."

You are talking about African slaves that came in several decades after the founding of Jamestown. What you appears to forget is that the first blacks that was brought ashore came from a captured Spanish slave ship. English had no real history of black slavery before this so they took them in as indentured servants like many of the whites who there as well. Most of the initial  indentured blacks were freed later on. They form the core of free black Americans until the ending of the Civil War in 1865. Do you not know your nation's history, Miss. Thrope? Of course, it is important to understand that without black slavers, there cannot be black slavery in the United States.. Are you that blind to the obvious? Black slavers enabled white racism!!! Ironic??"

Catholic sexual teaching has been bad for a long time, due to the idealism of Plato, the asexuality of Paul and guilty conscience of Augustine.  Attributing the body of teaching to something other than pharisaic piety (say the asexuality of the teachers) is an advance that won't be ignored, nor will ideas of healthy sexuality - or evolution and the lack of an Adam and Eve, as well as the inadequacy of any first homo sapiens parents as candidates for an Eden golden age. You can call resistance to change traditionalism or conservatism.  Label yourselves as you like, but give gays and lesbians the same privilege.

Absolutely.  She's been working on behalf of women, children and families her entire life -- and her pro-choice position on abortion notwithstanding, she's done more to prevent abortion and to reduce both the rate and number of abortions than Trump ever will.  Trump has demonstrated that he doesn't know anything at all about abortion law or policy, and doesn't care to know anything. Voting for him on the basis of family or life issues is preposterous: he's demonstrated that he doesn't know or care about them.  It's merely an excuse to vote for a racist, fascist know-nothing blowhard.

This is a woman who supported so-called welfare ""reform"" in 1996, when her husband signed the bill, which was all about kicking poor women off of welfare. Until Sanders started pushing against so-called ""free trade"" bills, Clinton and her husband supported them, as has Obama. Clinton is a supporter of corporations and Wall Street. Like her party for the last 20 some years, she has been opposed to the interests of working-class people. 

And she is widely known as an interventionist hawk on foreign policy, even more so than Obama. She will advance the Democrat-Republican policy of perpetual war in order to conquer the Middle East to support the business interests of US-based international corporations.

Sanders will make his own decisions, and we will make ours. I won't vote for Clinton. As a working-class person and war opponent, it's not in my best interests."

"The original inquiry indicated that the solve rate for murdered aboriginal women was the same as non-aboriginal women, in the 80% range, so we know what happened. As for the missing women, aboriginals are not the only people declared missing in Canada. There is simply no resources to look for every person who goes missing, and more often then not those missing people do not want to be found. As for the anecdotal evidence given at these hearings, the law can't act on anecdotal or hearsay reports to conduct investigations. If success is to be measured by justice, then there has been success because the conviction rate of 80% is justice. It's hard to see success coming out of this as each person's view will be different and it will be impossible to satisfy each and every participant."

As a result she missed the flight and had to be rescheduled, with the attendant seating problems.

The crux of the matter is the question about whether she truly showed up 90 minutes early and whether her allegations of agents not being available are true.  If the allegations are true, Air Canada would likely be at fault for not properly accommodating her family on the next flight, because it was their fault that she had to be on that flight.

I suspect that something isn't true about her allegations.

Personally, I find it hard to believe that there were no agents available.  I've traveled a lot around this country on Air Canada over the last 10 years and I've never had a problem findings available agents in the two hours before a flight."

"""I want Muslim columnists to be clear on their views on women, not terrorism.""

OK fair enough, I'm assuming your fear of Muslims extends beyond sharia to other elements of fundamentalism. However my point still stands, you're demanding that Muslim columnists be clear on their views about women otherwise you assume they favour sharia and the treatment of women as second class citizens.. You're assuming they are guilty unless they meet your demand to prove themselves otherwise. It's ridiculous, paranoid, and fear mongering, and frankly a bit irrational. You're essentially claiming all Muslims are women hating, sharia loving fundamentalists yet your only basis for this is that they are Muslim. You're not even dealing with them as individuals, you're just lumping them all together with the fundamentalists.

As for the commentors condemning Bissonnette, do you think they were doing it to disassociate themselves personally or to underline that violence and attacking Muslims is wrong?"

If he had been married to the woman and had tortured her continually for years or decades, he likely would have spent the night in jail. He may have even ultimately won custody of their children. The protection order would have meant very little, as he would have charmed the people around him and stalked his victim strategically. In any effort by the victim to obtain a divorce, she would have been treated like the criminal. The decades of torment would have been treated as a public irritant and the victim, in trying to escape, would be in the greatest danger of murder at that point. Rich, poor, professional, or otherwise, it goes thus."

More serious abuse such as punching, kicking or use of weapons or one sided abuse will still be against the law.

"You speak in absolutes and with broad strokes. That is my problem. 

My main question is this: how are you any different than these liberals?

Didn't we just discuss how neither Trump or Clinton were convicted of rape? Need I remind you that both Trump and Clinton have had women come forward accusing them of sexual assault? You're dismissive of one and you attack the other. You're inconsistent and it's because you're putting partisan politics over morality. If you can defend Trump as being falsely accused and still think you are in the right, then people can do the same thing for the Clintons without being ""evil"". Until someone is put in prison for rape it's speculation and to pick a side is absurd. 

I don't care for either one of their behavior towards women, and if there's any truth to the allegations I hope justice is served. It's not a partisan issue for me, and it seems to be for you. You think ""I'm right, they're wrong"" when in reality we all agree sexual assault is wrong."

There are also signs to this effect on the washroom walls.

The women who used to give this talk said it was done politely and tactfully and they never had any issues but prior to the 'welcome' sessions there were lots of complaints to HR.

This comment is cont. from comment below: so why does this report give a false impression about celibacy & homosexuality influencing child abuse in priests & refuses to state that having women priests & bishops would automatically lower future abuse rates simply because women have always abused less often and usually not sexually? Simple answer-These experts want married priests as they are ex-priests themselves & they don't care that this would not change any rate of abuse to children in our church because that does not get them what they want.  They themselves are sexist & don't really want ordained women priests so they use the Future Church mode of speech & say the church's lacking female authority & leadership roles? may have made abuse more likely.  Sexual abusers go to where there is best access & the least threat to be caught.  Children would likely tell a woman priest in their parish if their co-pastor was hurting them.  We need to do what is right and ordain women priests now

"Years ago I attended an evangelical church where the pastor chose the Scripture readings for the sermon and theme of that Sunday.  It was always something from the OT, or a cherry picked selection from Paul's epistles that supported the pastor's worldview.  NEVER Jesus' direct words from the Gospels about humility, care for the poor, love fulfilling the law, etc.  Less of a problem for the Catholic Church where Scripture readings are set for every week of the year, but still, the bishops still have their own priorities in these selections, with notable de-emphasis of women's stories in Scripture.

The usual solution to these things isn't a ban but education and liberation.

Her stating statistics (2-8% is accepted false reporting rate) without citation of any kind is not unusual for feminists. They like to present “alternative truths” on a regular basis.

"Phrogge,
I agree with you, but I might take it one step further here.  I think where the church has gotten itself tangled up is in the transition between how jesus lived, and the concept of ""commands"" of or by Jesus.  

I think his ""commands"" were very simple: Love God, Love your neighbor.  In all likelihood, all else was about examples of what that might mean. I think when we try to interpret Gospel stories as a ""command""  by Jesus, we miss the point.  The cost of that ""miss"" plays out in the hot button issues of our day.  I could imagine a very different position for a vibrant church today, for example, if the focus were on just those two commands, followed by good faith efforts to understand how those might apply to homosexuals, woman's ordination, the scandal, etc.

I agree that we have all the tools we need today. Can/will we use them?  I think there's a growing sense that if we are to use them, we'll have to find a place outside the church to do so."

"Do not insult the mentally ill by inferring she wasn't in her ""right"" mind or able to make sound decisions. 
No she is NOT a nut case, she is a sociopath who has no feelings for anyone but herself. She preys on people who are vulnerable and uses her manipulative skills to con them out of their money PLUS she uses the information she fraudulently obtain from them under false pretenses to apply for credit cards with their information. 
This woman will get out and be back to some type of con where she will victimize more people. 
Some many consider this to be a ""victimless"" crime or a non-violent crime but that is far from reality. 
Reality is that people suffered because of what she did. 
This is often considered a ""white collar"" crime because the weapons she used to commit her robberies were words and paper work but the end result was the same,she robbed people who placed trust in her.
Bet her story is a tear jerker and she is so sorry for her actions (getting caught).
No cure for her."

"There is something seriously wrong here, either with the estimate, or with the appraised value.   No reputable insurance company would do an $8K repair on a vehicle that is only worth $11K.    I don't believe you have to accept their settlement to repair.    

I've unfortunately had two experiences this year - my daughter's car was written off for a repair that was about $6K (appraised value was about $11K).    The damage did not appear to be that severe BUT the estimate was over a trigger so the car was written off.    I had the option of having the repair done, but then the car would need to be re-titled as a salvage so I took the buyout.

More recently, my car was rear-ended.    Very, very minor damage (rear bumper cover had a tiny crack).    But the repair was about $4K all in (pretty sure the prices were maxed out because it was an insurance job).     So now my car is perfect, but if I were to sell it, there is a $4,000 claim on Carfax.     So I lose out when I sell or trade."
"Seems like a wonderful project. Hopefully Renton as a municipality under the administration of Mayor Law will continue to conform, qualify, for CDFI funds, HUD community block grant funding, DoJ COPS and Violence Against Women grants, not to be construed as preclusive, in complying with all federal statutes err laws written by Congress, while observing the civil rights of the city's own residents and guests in her municipal courts and at her police department. The HUD community block grant program alone is 1/3rd of First Financial Northwest Foundation's entire endownment -- and about 1 to 2 percent of the city's entire budget. And then, of course, we would have to think about all funding at Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and HUD, residential housing for the jurisdiction, along with the SBA. No doubt it will all work out."

"Thank you, Julia, for sharing your story, and in doing so, giving others who have experienced sexual assault a safe space to share their own experiences. Unfortunately, there is still a quick jump to disbelieve women when they come forward with rape charges, especially when alcohol is involved. Hopefully, those who are quick to assume the woman must somehow have done something to invite sexual assault will read your story and take pause."

I read that the list of people in the Senate who are trying to do this are:

From what I have read, when a woman gets an abortion it is usually for someone else's convenience.
I have also read of the terrible mental consequences many suffer.
*
So here we have a group of sympathetic people who set up an organization to provide help to women who want to investigate a way out of this for themselves.
If this group of senators had goodness in them I think they would be passing a bill to support this organization, not looking for ways to harass it."

If we win a majority of those delegates, we can cut even more into Clinton’s lead!
To achieve that victory, each of us needs to get out the vote. We only have 24 hours, but a few calls to undecided voters can net us many more delegates.  No matter where you are in the world, you can help phonebank.'

"It should have been over and done a year ago.
It should have effectively ended before the election.
It did not–and the fact that it did not speaks volumes about this country.
One year ago today, it was reported:
Donald Trump bragged in vulgar terms about kissing, groping and trying to have sex with women during a 2005 conversation caught on a hot microphone, saying that “when you’re a star, they let you do it,”
Watch that Access Hollywood tape again.
Think about its repulsive legacy.
Large segments of the American electorate couldn’t handle the truth about Trump’s basement-low regard for women, and the policy implications thereof.
Large segments of the American electorate cared more about Clinton’s e-mails than they cared about Trump’s egregious misogyny..and because they didn’t care, the hand that Trump once used to grope women was the same hand he placed on the Bible to take the Oath of Office on January 20."

They were all sober of course, perhaps sipping tea,  just minding their own business when the racist cops, just  out of the blue, started to beat them up and abuse them because they are natives."
"I support standardized course evaluations that are tied to a professor's pay and promotion.  Having graduated from Waterloo myself, I've had my fair share of profs who just don't care about teaching or is exceptionally disrespectful towards students.  Hence, I disagree with the suggestion that students are always ""biased"".  If for example, most of the students do poorly on a midterm, then there has to be something wrong with your teaching.  Administration can't be in every classroom, without evaluation, how would they know? Obviously some profs, especially the ones who don't like to teach, would prefer not to be hold accountable and I'm not surprised if they're the ones opposing here. Systematic biases like lower rating for women or minority profs shouldn't ignored of course, but course evaluation MUST carry weight."
"Before you make a statement like ""The US isn't competitive internationally at xc and never will be"" you should check the World Cup rankings, where a number of US women (several of whom train in Alaska) are ranked in the ""seeded group"" - the cream of the crop of the World Cup field.

"For once, you and I agree, I would in fact love to see a female president - but NOT the one currently gunning for the job.
We have some very capable female politicians in this country, in several parties (including a few in the ANC) whom I would love to see take that office. Of course Thuli Madonsela would have the whole country cheering her - but sadly has already expressly stated that she has no intention to enter politics but there are some great women parliamentarians within the ruling party that have been making headlines by standing on principle and taking their oaths of office more seriously than party loyalty. I could definitely be happy to cheer the swearing in of president Khoza !"
Darwin was married to a very devote Christian women who was the love of his life. Darwin had internal struggles about what he was learning and his wife's Christian beliefs. When it appeared that another scientists at the same time was formulating the nature of genetics it was Darwin's wife who insisted that her husband publish his completed work now and get the credit and recognition he deserved in England among his fellow scientists and the world.  And so he did.
"You know Aspen7, what is really interesting about the whole ""narrative"" as written by the ""writer"" is that he gave tons of money to Hillary and supported her campaign.  Yet, we don't hear a peep out of Hillary on this - nor do we see her giving money back.  It was just like with her husband, she keeps her mouth shut.  Hillary isn't for anyone but herself.  I wonder why Alceste doesn't comment on this - after all she seems to have an opinion on Trump.  Well, why doesn't she have an option on Hillary keeping quite, once again, why fellow women are molested and assaulted?"
"Late term abortions are so rare that many of the smaller provinces don't even have the service and have to send women elsewhere when they need one.

Anti-abortion groups have exaggerated the idea that there are ""no restrictions"" on late term abortions.  It's not criminal, that's true.  But doctors and hospitals don't perform late term abortions unless there is a serious health problem with the mother or fetus.  I think we should leave it as is -- that women can choose in the early stage of pregnancy, but doctors decide when a late term abortion is warranted."

"Everyone knows that law enforcement conducts an interview when they do not know the information and they conduct an interrogation when they do. This is done to see if you will lie. Hillary was interrogated yesterday as she is the subject of this inquiry. The short three hour interrogation shows that it was targeted and to the point with information gained from the other people given immunity. Kyle Craig is correct in pointing out that Powell and Rice did not have homebrew servers in their home. Democrats use this to muddy the waters to mislead their plantation people as they always do. Bill's interjection with the Attorney General is a mark of desperation as he knows that his wife will be indicted with as least 4counts of liability under the Espionage Act and 3 counts of selling favors out of the office of State by the 27th of this month. 

The Dems will have to go to Bernie and he knows this as he stays in the race.

"The one thing that was very persuasively suggested long ago was that the more a person starts out with, the less she will suffer as the grip of dementia and Alzheimer's tightens with age.  I'm referring to the long-term study tracking a cohort of nuns over the course of decades.  Nuns were deemed a better group to study age-related mental decline than members of the general population since implicitly, variables such as excessive alcohol consumption, tobacco use, the indulgence of illicit drugs, and a generally unhealthy diet could be controlled or minimized. 

After many years it was observed that those nuns that when young, began their adult lives with a higher level of educational achievement, a more expansive vocabulary and related to it, very good reading comprehension and reasoning ability, were able to maintain their mental acuity longer than their peers who lacked those qualities.  It appears the more you have at the beginning - generally - the more you end up with at the end."
girls are so icky
"Regarding: ""If returned to back alley clinics...""
- The statistical facts of the number of abortions in the USA prior to Roe V Wade illustrate the difficulties in tracking something that is illegal.  That is; in a region were abortions are illegal; if your are a licensed medical professional performing abortions then to whom would your report and why would you do so?
- Perhaps the overwhelming concern about illegal abortions was and is that they all to often were done with wire coat hangers, knitting needles, and medicines that were abortifacients. For instance circa 1900,  medicinals which were sold to return a women to her 'regular cycle' were in effect abortifacients.
- Statistical evidence of  illegal abortions in those days were gleaned from hospital records of women coming to hospitals with sepsis, chronic bleeding, or damaged uteri. They also came from death certificates of women wherein the coroner would note the cause of death."
This woman should be fired from her job. She is a typical self-serving leftist tool that puts her politics and sick world view ahead of her responsibility to teach. I hope she finds herself in the unemployment line but of course that will just give her more to bi$ch about.

"They seem to think that the 2 are somehow related...go figure.  So the comments about people being ""against Hillary because she's a woman"" make sense in that fantasy world.  Why can't ""it"" be about the facts?  Every time facts are mentioned or honest parallels illustrated,[Bryan Nishamura comes to mind] Clinton apologists change the subject....because there IS no defense possible! Comey clearly stated that anyone in his organization doing the same, would be ""severely reprimanded or terminated.""  Since Clinton was at the time, under the same laws, she is culpable under the statue Comey mentioned - it's that pesky ""gross negligence"" thing - put in to specifically catch those ""extremely careless"" employee's.  The real question should be why are liberals defending her?"

"I have always believed that being ""progressive"" is just another term for being a narcissist. You see it all of the time, people doing silly things, than announcing it to the world like they have done something so noble and wise. I'm quite positive that without the ability to publicly pat themselves on the back, many of these ""progressives"" would have no interest in being ""progressive"". In other words how people perceive them takes precedence over how they probably really feel on the subject.

"That's like demanding young women to take a class in avoiding rape. But there is no restriction on the rapist. Its the old agrument that the young woman should not have worn provocative clothing. It  places the burden of the crime on her, not the perpetrator.

"Ann, I am not sure exactly what you mean by saying women have a lower accountability threshold.
Women that get pregnant are held accountable for having unprotected sex. 
Women who carry a baby to full term are held accountable for the safety and health care of the baby even if there is a father in the picture. 
Society holds women accountable for being raped by saying the woman should not have been dressed the way she was or that she should not have been out late at night walking alone. Sometimes they say the woman deserved what she got because she was incapacitated. Women who are beaten are held accountable too. By society and by the system. She should just ""leave"" him. She should keep her mouth shut. Be a ""good"" wife.
Women are held accountable for being single parents by society and the system. It comes in the form of lower wages, lack of affordable housing and lack of safe childcare.

Saw Ms. Rose last night at the 'Shoe, appropriately, though nothing compares to her old gigs at the Cameron, if you were lucky, with Colonel Tom opening.

Such a treasure.

Mix in Kitty Wells, Patsy Cline, a lot of Linda Ronstadt, some Dinah Washington and a big dollop of Johnny Cash (if he were a female!), package all of that in a terminally sweet diminutive little doll and you've got the essence of Whitney Rose.

New EP is superlative, with her strong songwriting and some of Country music's top studio guns (Red Volkaert, Earl Poole Ball and more).

Kudos to Six Shooter Records for putting Whitney into Austin (the germination factory of Real Country And Western Music) and stepping up with top-drawer album production and world tour.

Best Whitney ever? The night the power went out at The Cameron.

No problem for Whitney and her band - piano, snare drum, acoustic guitar, stand-up base, no mikes or amps (or lights!) - just Whitney singing her heart out at each table!

Fantastic!

On one hand, I don't think state funding should go to supporting religion. On the other hand, if this ""free shredded tires"" program was open to any public OR private school that met certain qualifications, and this religious school qualified, it is religious discrimination to tell the school ""no"" solely because it was church-owned.

I seriously doubt that given your negative attitude and likely mental illness, that you bring even a fraction of happiness to those around you that a feline or other companion animals do, in fact, if you have mated and then bred, I can pretty much guarantee that your wife hates and fears you and she and your children have zero respect for you, but hey, carry on with your cat-killing ways, I just hope for our species that you don't progress along the path that it seems certain you will.  Your family and your neighbors should fear for their lives."
"So the 'Ministry of Art, Creativity and Interpretation' objected to the non-conforming racialized cast of Othello. The 'Ministry' considered this to be blasphemous (though the unusual casting was part of the essence - or art - of the Edmonton theatre's interpretation of the play). Violence was threatened unless a black person played the role of Othello. The Theatre caved into pressure and apologized for getting it wrong."
I couldn't help but think of this last night when a bi-racial little girl showed up on my door step wearing a long blond wig over her dark hair and an Elsa costume.  I wonder if her mother was worried about appropriating Nordic culture?

"I'm surprised that the rate of unfounded allegations is only 20%
Working in an ER, I see a significant number of these alleged sexual assault cases falling apart due to glaring ""inconsistencies"" from the ""victim"", which suggest alterior motives, during the initial police interview. Despite these glaring inconsistencies, I observe that the female physicians and nurses doing the sexual assault kit never seem to be able to entertain any doubt about the truthfulness of the victim's claim."
"An incredibly insensitive article which is disrespectful of an accomplished woman politician who has dedicated her entire life to serving the American public and improving the lives of countless people around the world.  I'm not sure what gives Mr. Martin the right to be so critical of someone who has accomplished so much more than he has or ever will.  He should put down his pen in shame.
In any case the issue is not one of Ms. Clinton leaving the stage, but of someone emerging within the Democratic Party to provide new leadership.  So far, there is no one in sight.  When fresh, inspiring and energetic leadership emerges, I'm sure that Ms. Clinton will be among the first to lend her support."

"I have never heard of this Protoevangelon of James!  Yikes! Joseph a widower, when he married Mary??  I presume that this Joseph of yours married a younger woman so that she could take care of his 'several sons' and household?  Sheesh!

"The last two paragraphs are an excellent summary of what Canadian Muslims and newcomers must understand and reflect on:

""Those who worry about an erosion of “Canadian values” should be engaged in an honest manner, rather than with denunciation. The cultural values surrounding women, critical inquiry, freedom of expression and freedom of conscience in many Muslim countries are often at odds with prevailing Western norms. Canadian Muslims must begin to have meaningful debates on how to reconcile these two world views.

What are the universal tenets of the faith that can be translated from society to society? And what are the cultural norms of the old world that must be replaced with the new? Such deliberations must be made with great care, with recognition that Canada is a diverse nation, bound by shared values, as defined by our Charter of Rights and Freedoms."""

"I don't know you or your hot-button issues. Let me assume, however.
You care about the environment, i.e. clean air, clean energy.
You care about hate-filled, toxic society, i.e. one in which attacks (verbal and otherwise) come about because of hate-speech from a candidate.
You care about the economy, i.e. regulation of financial and other sectors is important.
You care about women's rights and appointments that could affect the SCOTUS for the foreseeable future.

"This, like the Bell Curve, ignores the environmental impact on career choice. I scored in the 98th percentile on science achievement tests. No one encouraged me to pursue medical research. It was unheard of because of my race and gender. Never tested, they said I had average or below average intelligence. At the age of 47 years,  I scored as intellectually superior on one test and higher than 705 of the population on the other. These scores were met with displeasure by my career counselor. Empowered I finished my B.S. degree, pursued a career in technical communication. Exclusionary and abusive environments limit academic and career choice.  Blacks pursue careers in sports not because their brains and bodies are hardwired to excel there, but because they are exposed to it in their environment and it is where they see people that look like them succeed.  My premise: women exposed to exclusionary and abusive environments cause changes in the areas of the brain that impact career choice."

"As the first member of my family to ever graduate from high school and who attended undergraduate education on the GI Bill or while in the service and worked part or full-time for my entire college time, I have absolutely no sympathy for your whining.

There are too many successful black people in the world who are your color and age and some even became multi-millionaires.  Dr. Ben Carson is one who comes immediately to mind.  Were you from a single mother in the Detroit projects like he was?  

The black General officers who are also your age and did their duty and excelled instead of whining are other examples.

I was at Duck U in the 60's and 70's;  Four (4) women were in the law school with me; where were you?  

Somewhere whining that failure is not your fault because your forbears were still slaves in 1864?

My family believed in that old motto; ""Root, hog; or die!""  

Nothing is given; you have to work and earn it.

I don't give my name in part because of racists like you."
"The inquiry is not doomed to failure a much as it is planned with purpose to create a perpetual source of revenue for the Grievance Industry, including that industry's lawyers, consultants and anyone else who can tell a story consistent with that purpose.
It is the shakedown that never ends, and the missing or murdered women are to it just another emotionally evocative triggers for a process that many have come to depend upon for their daily gruel, and that will be stirred like a bed of ashes for as long as we voters elect political parties susceptible to being blackmailed by Grievance Industry players."

"This judge has shown bias against women, homeless people, poor people, young people, and victims of criminal violence. This was not unconscious, unspoken bias: this was extremist bias that led him to demonize innocent victims. Such bias does not go away with two weeks of sensitivity training.

"not always true, there are some crazy mean using and abusing women in the world and the numbers are growing, in the state I moved from , the law on domestic violence calls changed, when someone called for police on a domestic call , someone was going to jail, the number of women then incarcerated started to grow, 

I have been the victim of abuse from a women, I had quite a struggle in the court system, however I fought for my and even more important my children's rights to a peaceful safe home, I succeeded in wining full custody of my children and was awarded a small amount of child support, 

None of the support that women can get such as shelters, were available for me,

"Those who support him very likely know him and are well suited to evaluate what he has and has not done.  People like you have likely never met the dude and project your vile world view upon him.  The woman was paid via dropping of prostitution charges to testify against him.  Once payment is made, I cannot trust what is said especially when her trial and grand jury testimony disagree and she explains by saying that she was on drugs before the grand jury.  This is reliable testimony?  But never mind, you will say he was convicted and is therefore guilty.  The petitioners likely know him personally and are better placed to judge than either you or the jury."
"We don't have a passion issue at the University of Alaska.
We have a revenue issue. The supporters of UA Intercollegiate athletics  have offered no monetary solutions to raise the 14 million dollars to save their pet program. 
If your want to see UA intercollegiate athletics continue get the 140,000 fans to donate 27 cents a day ($100 a year per fan equates to 14 million dollars.)
or 
Start a pay to play program. If the college experince of playing intercollegiate athletics is so valuable it should be worth the $20,000 per athletic yearly cost to parpicipate. Fans could sponsor athletes also.
or
move to club teams like UA women's hockey and the APU ski team-which produces more Olympians than the whole UA system.

Student debt note-UA athletics is mostly paid for through State appropiations, mandated student fees, and scalping student tuition. Should we put students in college debt for a college experince they don't attend in mass?"

"Lynn Porter, I have read many of your post and what seems to be a common theme is that the “housed” are to blame for all of the problems homeless have. You are very passionate about the cause you have chosen to fight for, but don’t blame the “housed” for the homeless issue. Me being “housed” did not create drug and alcohol problems or mental issues some of the homeless have.  Me being housed did not cause anyone to be homeless. I work hard not to be in the position of being homeless. Most of us “housed”  work hard to take care of our families being “housed”. Tell me, are you “housed” or are you homeless? Have you opened you home to the homeless or let them camp on your property? If you have I commend you, but do the homeless you let stay pick up after themselves, or do you?  if you haven’t, please rethink your argument on who to blame for homelessness. Because I sit in my home does not make me a bigot, but you lumping all the “housed” together shows your bigotry to the “housed” ."

"Frankly, I don't buy the professor's explanation that she wore blackface to a Halloween party to teach about Damon Tweedy. Isn't the classroom the most appropriate venue for teaching something that significant, and doing it without blackface, especially if you are white? Halloween parties are ostensibly frivolous fun events, not a place for teaching anything like what she claims, therefore, I think she came up with this excuse ex post facto. 

But the most important question I would have for the professor, is why? Why did you not know that wearing blackface, even at a private party, was at the very least in poor taste and bad judgment, knowing the history of blackface in American history and culture? Why, especially as an educated white person in the U.S., did you not know that it is considered racist? If an African American person wore a doctor's coat with a name tag that said ""Dr. Tweedy"", that would make sense. But a middle-age white woman wearing blackface in the year 2016?"

Mariam, you have good reason to be afraid.   When Obama was elected president, the George Wallace constituency slithered out of the sewer of American history to say that he wasn't even an American citizen despite the fact they nad zero evidence that he was foreign born.  After he was reelected that constituency is even angrier.  They  worked to get Trump the Republican nomination.  If Trump wins the presidency, this underbelly of the American body politic will feel their moment has arrived.  Heaven help us!"
"Sygnia CEO Magda Wierzycka is one smart lady. Not only has she scored an admirable executive for Sygnia, she has shown-up Sage SA's timid response to an employee they could and should have recognised as 'a pearl of great price'.

"One witness reported that, ""nobody stood a chance"". All social correctness aside, tactically speaking a small fraction of that number would have been killed had one person in there been packing.

And I dunno know about Hales call to ""show a force"" by congregating in one spot is a tactically sound response to a group of gays that just got mowed down like sitting ducks.  I don't mean to be ""uncivil"" but protect yourself because politicians, security guards, and activists agains the NRA alike are not going to jump in front of a bullet for anyone, rather they'll just use this stuff to promote their idealistic and unrealistic agenda. If doing away with guns was gonna happen it would have happened long ago. How many of these incidents do we need to see before putting a stop to it?

"The adherents of those branches of Western Christianity don't condone ""honour"" killings, stoning people to death, beheading people, forced marriages  of child brides or tossing gays to their deaths from the roofs of tall buildings or hanging them from construction cranes as is the practice in Iran.

"No, it is you who has got it all wrong. We are discussing the general direction of NCReporter's contributing writers against that of the NCRegister not the USCCB or pastors teaching the faith from the pulpit. 
The main concerns of NCReporter contributors seem to be opposition to the Church's teaching on matters pertaining to sexual morality, particularly homosexuality and promoting feminism and left-wing political dogma as Catholic social justice.
When dissident groups are continually lobbying for acceptance of sexual practices which the Church teaches are gravely sinful then it is only to be expected that the bishops and pastors would speak out against them. When society broadly concurred with the Church's teaching on sexual morality, homosexuality, abortion, etc, then there was no need to preach against these things. It is only since Catholic dissidents began to advocate the rejection and reversal of the teachings that the Church has had to re-emphasise what it teaches."
"Do you actually read what I write or simply use it as a foil to talk? Hard to figure how you honestly did it, but you conflated rights with choice.

As to your other comment trying to marginalize my comments, it's a matter of taste between us and as with most comment of mine you react/respond to, you have a contrary reply without much substantive argument to present in your own right.

Hillary shouldn't be locked up for political reasons; Hillary should be locked up because she is a criminal. But I feel the same way about G.W. Bush.
"Profits go up when women are in the boardroom? 
It’s a compelling argument, but there’s no actual evidence that it’s true. Lots of studies show a correlation between higher female board representation and higher returns, but no one has definitively proven causation; that it’s the act of adding women that drove the financial performance. Profitability is far too complex to be solved that simply. There may be well-grounded reasons for increasing women’s presence on boards, but enhanced financial performance isn’t one of them, and a 2010 study of companies in Norway, where a law requires 40% of board seats to be filled by women, showed that financial performance declined."

"Carrie Downing-Larick Those of us who pay taxes pay for state-provided ""health care"" which includes, in this circumstance, abortion. Whether you agree or not, I consider abortion to be the murder of an unborn child. While we can debate whether society has the authority to prevent you from killing your unborn children, there should be no debate that you should not have the authority to force me to pay for it. The reason for that is simple and should be obvious to anyone -- I should not be forced to commit murder, not even indirectly through funding it. And that is what SB 89 is all about -- removing public funding from agencies that use ""women's health services"" as a euphemism for funding abortions. There are other actual women's health organizations that do not provide abortion and should be fully funded ... and in fact will be better funded if we get rid of the abortion mills. If you want to kill your unborn child, pay for it yourself. Murder is not health care!"

"OK, let me clarify then. I did think Glenn's comment was offensive and inappropriate, and as I wrote, I flagged it as inappropriate (and did not feel it was worthwhile to repeat it). It was intended to objectify and belittle (and put back into place) a strong woman leader in our country (regardless of what you or I think of her politics). Totally offensive and inappropriate. I'm not sure how that could be more clear. ... Despite my flagging, the system did not remove it (I'm not privy as to why). It still is there now, more than a week later. ... I do not agree, though, that the email prompt encourages a flip response; I really appreciate knowing when someone responds to something I wrote, so I can decide if I want to respond as well. My actions are my responsibility. Sometimes I'm too quick and too loose in my responses, but that's on me. The alternative is that you aren't alerted when someone comments. I think the email alert encourages a complete discussion (rather than a fragment)."
"No, I didn't know this, but it doesn't surprise me. That order has strange opinions.

I watched a video last year on some of the order's activities in India; the video, a piece of investigative journalism, was on YouTube. Apparently, one of the senior nuns committed an act of calculated sadism on three or four young children at her school. The children, from poor families, were suspected  (just suspected) of stealing a sum of money from the school and the nun lined them up while she heated a metal knife on some sort of stove; she then seared a hand of each child. It was vicious! And gravely sinful.

The reporter interviewed the nun who had replaced Mother Theresa as Superior General and who had been named by Mother herself as her successor: Sister Mary Nirmala. Mary Nirmala defended the conduct of the senior nun on the ground that what had happened needed to happen in order to teach the children exactly whom it was they were serving.

"Hire:  To continue, Libby is a free-lance writer, and the author of the blog ""One Hot Mess"".  It would be reasonable to infer that she may sometimes write material designed to stir up controversy.  A self-promotion tactic.  So, the question we must ask ... is she really the seemingly oppressed waif as portrayed in her article?  Or is she stirring her readership kettle?  She is also a lawyer, a vocation widely regarded as below used car salesmen for veracity.  Personally, I neither believe nor doubt her self-portrayal in her article.  I simply have responded on the face value of it.  It gave me opportunity to express some of my views on what true friendship is, or is not.  Just like you, I have elbows and opinions.  I also find the diverse, often divergent opinions of others to be very educational and informative.

If that doesn't constitute fullness of participation I am eager to hear what possibly could.

"Since Canada is a ""diverse"" country, there are no common qualities that can be attributed to its population. For instance, you used to be able to say ""Swedes are blond"" but now since Swedes have become ""diverse"" this generality can no longer be claimed. The only claim you can make about Canada is that it's an ideological state fanatically committed to  diversity and it suppresses all opinion in contravention this ideal, however, this is not in any way unique in the Western world.  Other than that, Canada has no national character; no multi-cultural country does."
"Kenneth:  We have over 300 million firearms in private ownership.  Such ownership is constitutionally protected and, barring a Constitutional Amendment, those 300 million guns will remain in private ownership.  

I do agree that the NRA, which was once an organization representing sportsmen/women is now, unfortunately, largely controlled by the arms industry. Less than half the NRA funding now comes from individual membership.  Each day, of course, these manufacturers sell thousands of weapons as Americans attempt to ""arm themselves to safety.""  Ironically, of course, the ready availability of firearms, according to all statistics, makes everyone around LESS safe.  Indeed, police officers are nervous....justifiably so.  Statistically, those ""domestic dispute"" calls are among the most dangerous calls, and the more guns in those homes, the more dangerous it is.  It's easy to make arguments about the danger the omnipresence of firearms represents.  it's hard to find answsers for it......."
"The fact that Margaret Sanger promoted birth control as a means to promote one race and control birth in other races, does not mean to me birth control is bad.  It means her ideas about race are bad.  Gloria Steinem and Betty Friedan were important in promoting the ideas that women have more to give to society than clean floors, cooked meals, and babies.  They made a difference in changing attitudes about women's education, employment, fair wages, legal rights.  We can't talk about what shapes our society without talking about the tremendous change in the position of women in society today versus just 100 year ago. They may have had some bad ideas along with the good, but that does not dismiss what they helped accomplish.

The Catholic Church, many bishops and popes, defended slavery for centuries.  If Margaret Sangor's name is to forever be sullied, why not the names of Catholic popes who defended slavery?  And lets not speak of the guilt by association of bishops and child sex abuse."

"My wife is in ICU because of that moose. 18 broken ribs and on a ventilator. She just got out of surgery. I live one house away from where they killed it. Why did they kill it? Because it attacked another woman. I was out watering my lawn and I heard someone yell Help me! Help me! I ran to the trail and helped distract the moose until the woman could escape from behind some trees. She'd been stomped and was in shock. Fish and Wildife came, and it charged them. As for my wife, go to gofundme.com and search for moose attack victim. She wasn't distracted, she wasn't careless. What happened to her would have happened to the next person to walk by, be it adult or child. Where she was attacked was just feet from the main road. It's easy to say she should have seen it, or she should have done this or that. It saddens me that there are so many people with so many armchair opinions, and so little compassion for a beautiful lady who almost lost her life."

"You fail to understand what I said. I said that the argument given us is ""Christ did not choose women for the Twelve, therefore women cannot be ordained"". The logic of that argument is IDENTICAL with the argument ""Christ did not choose gentiles for the Twelve, therefore gentiles cannot be ordained"".  In other words, both arguments are of the form ""Christ did not choose members of group X for the Twelve, therefore members of group X cannot be ordained"". The only difference between the two is the selection of X.

To put it simply, both arguments are equally bogus."
"We are fortunate in Canada to have breast cancer screening programs everywhere except Nunavut.. Canadian data shows that breast cancer mortality is reduced by 40% in all women and by 44% in women ages 40-49 years old (Coldman et al, J Natl Cancer Inst. 2014). Absolute mortality reduction was 9% lower in women who were screened . Ms Weekes does not do service to the benefits of screening and threatens to risk more women opting not to screen and lose the benefits of early detection. We know that mammograms are not perfect, which is why we strive to improve the detection of breast cancer through research in supplemental screening with digital breast tomosynthesis, breast MRI and breast ultrasound. The good news that Ms. Weekes did not focus on is that with improved access of the BRCA test we can save more lives in women at highest risk for breast cancer. Women need to know more about this kind of research and make informed decisions about their health."

That may pass as a clever response among the gerbil brained left and as such effectively deal with the topic at hand but when you venture Outside your little niche of people it simply just a deflection. I normally leave it up to the responder to find their own sources who refute the comment I made because it has been my experience that you're not really interested in the source because there is no source good enough to open your eyes and kickstart your brain. Bill Clinton raped over 30 women who complained about it that is common knowledge among the informed electorate if you don't believe it then find some buddies who agrees with you who actually knows the truth good luck with that"
"What's the process for medical professionals when they witness or are made aware of physical or sexual abuse on reserves?  Report to the chief?  Report to separate native child welfare services?  Report to local native police?

They can blame everyone else all they want but this is a serious, serious issue, and instead of focusing on healing circles and reducing prison times, they need to vigorously attack these problems, sadly it's not in scope for the missing native women inquiry, and definitely will not be even considered as a root cause for higher suicide rates.  They have to really look to the predators within their community and handle them aggressively rather than trying to paint a boogeyman that doesn't exist (e.g non-natives).

Sadly the focus is not on these kids but creating more conditions to leverage their victimhood for financial gain.  That's pretty much it, all the doctors and counsellors in the world won't help an abused kid if the abuser is always there."

"I don't fully agree with your post, however the two responses clearly completely misunderstand the role of religion. It is one thing to give off holidays, I am jewish and took off important jewish holidays, with accommodations on a daily basis. No one is restricting a muslim from being excused for high holidays, that is what a christmas and easter holiday is. It is not accommodating every single request.

FYI - in thorncliffe public school in toronto, and what this article fails to mention, is that the prayers are not open to all and equitable, i.e., women at thorncliffe are not allowed to attend while on their periods. How is that appropriate? The prayers at that school are also conducted in the school cafeteria thereby making it inaccessible to any non-muslim student, again that is not open and equitable."

People equip themselves and their car for cold and/or snow emergencies while on route. Why can they not do the same for this kind of circumstance? Particularly if they have an older model.

"Hopefully by the morning Scott Woodham will comment on here and explain why . My guess is they fear there will be anti-native comments and they don't want to upset those people.  Just like they did when Wolhforth did the story on the gay native lady---they were afraid of what people might say.   The new system seems to be working pretty good , though for reasons only known to them , liberals want free speech banned  and / or deleted if the person making the comment is against what they believe in.  The Dispatch needs to choose----do they want free speech or not ?  Allowing no comments on certain stories is censorship , pure and simple.   Since the new system started , the Dispatch has had perhaps three to four times more people taking the time to comment on stories . One would think the Dispatch would be happy about that. You'd think they'd trust the commenters to pass the civil test , but instead just shut it down ."

"According to the Wall Street Journal, the following changes were approved by Republican House Leadership on Monday in order to garner Conservative support for the AHCA:

1.Medicaid Eligibility: States would have the option of imposing work requirements on many Medicaid beneficiaries who aren’t disabled, pregnant or elderly, starting on Oct. 1, 2017.

2. Medicaid Funding: Under the proposed change, states would have the choice of getting that set amount—known as a block grant—or capped funding based on the number of enrollees, which is known as per-capita funding. Both funding options would result in less federal money for states, but block grants give states more flexibility in how they implement Medicaid."

"The UO AD takes less from the General Fund, for sure, than the OS equivalent. But part of playing sports is abiding by regulations, so if you want football you need to have women's sports. Sure, ADs across the country would love to claim the revenue sports and dump everything else on the General Fund, but academic departments would love to claim tuition and not have to pay faculty but I don't see that happening either!

UO has it about as good as it gets. But it makes me wonder, if this is as good as it gets.. just taking a few million each year and needing massive tax-exempt donations, is this really a good system? Every school could benefit from sports if they had the guts to cap spending, salaries included. But right now they can't pay players, so they seek tiny advantages by outspending on very minor flash--the exotic wood locker rooms, the players only mini-golf courses, etc. People were fans when players had stinky locker rooms and coaches made $200,000 a year. Why not now?"
"Some of London's impoverished Muslim immigrants have 8 - 10 kids, 3 wives and pull in more on welfare than full time jobs. More kids, more money More wives, more money.

"I just had an experience with a double ended real-estate deal in Courtenay BC for a house. I was the buyer. I did my due diligence and discovered that there was arsenic in the well water above the maximum allowed limit.

The realtor (yes my realtor who also was the seller's realtor) not once said to me that arsenic in the well water is an issue. In fact she tried to convince me it was not an issues by saying the seller has been drinking the water for 20 years and said she had no problems with the water.

I ended up killing the deal. And I fired the realtor. In the process I talked to the realtor's managing broker. He said that he knew about this particular house and did talk to the realtor about the water issue. He said arsenic in the water was a big issue and it could possible have a negative impact the neighbourhood in terms of the prices of the properties and that someone should inform the neighbours about checking their well water for arsenic.

"Yes, a woman’s body is hers, and she should therefore choose to behave responsibly with it. Once she has taken action to create a new human being whose body is their own, not their mother’s, the mother has a new responsibility, that of motherhood. The goal of mainstream conservative Christians (not the far right as you suppose) is not to control any woman, but to encourage self-responsibility, and for her and her spouse to teach the same responsibility to their children. Taking responsibility for ones self and passing that along to ones children is the ultimate empowerment, regardless of economic status or the number of humans in existence. Shirking that responsibility and taking away any chance of it for your offspring by killing your child is the ultimate acknowledgement that you lack power over yourself and have become a slave to the mind-control of the abortion movement and the arbitrary timelines set by the Supreme Court."

If anything we should all be concerned at the general apathy of the voters. Most people don't care about the perceived First World Problems because they are struggling to survive every day.

"Amen.  We literally have made it so that if women and LGBT people do not want to hate themselves as human beings they need to go to secular society to find real worth.  Our church only teaches they are lesser people, deserving of lesser opportunities and sacraments, and so we force them out of our communities and raise our hands to God - where did everyone go and why did they leave?"
The president elect has zero interest in the abortion issue and was unprepared to deal with the most basic questions about abortion policy because he doesn't fundamentally care and has never delved into the matter.  His position hasn't changed since the time he was persuaded to be pro-choice by one of his wives. You can bet on. Anyone who sucked up this lie will be disappointed. This is totally out of his wheelhouse.
Yep.Americans and Israelis are f%%%ing Sudanis women to produce kids.
"Is Islamophobia against the law, or is discrimination based on Islamophobia against the law?

Big difference!!

I hate religions, and religiosity. They are diverting human purpose to streams of contention. And they are all mostly based on ancient scripts from the bronze age, and therefore they oppose progress (Galileo), they oppose Women's rights, oppose Darwinian evolution, oppose Right to Choose, oppose rational thinking by forcing the young into accepting the (false) truths of the scriptures.

I HATE religions. All of them. No discrimination here. I am vocal and I decry their right to exist.

Am I guilty of Islamophobia?"
"Actually, what I said was in error. My reply should read: She told her constituents she was anti abortion and anti gay and voted accordingly. Now she has become pro choice and pro marriage equality.

"The estimate is that somewhere between 3% and 5% of women in this country use NFP.  It is not high in most countries where women are educated and contraceptives widely available.  They represent a very small percent of Catholic women and so represent a view held by only a very small percent of women who have the choice.  

I do not say that women who use NFP should be excluded.  Read my comment again.  I think women who use NFP and find value in their marriages and in their lives from doing so have their own story to tell, a viewpoint that also needs to be talked about and shared.  But it is a minority viewpoint for most women, including Catholic women, in countries where contraceptives are widely and easily available.  What should not be ignored any longer is the huge majority of Catholic women and their Catholic husbands who do not accept NFP as a reasonable method for managing family size, the timing of children, and even assuring the health of the woman."

"I certainly DO KNOW what Jansenism is.  It is the Catholic version of Calvinism---an almost Puritanical version of Catholicism.  And I am well aware of its tenants.  In fact, a lot of Jansenism crept into the Catholic Church in America

Jansenist spirituality was an attempt to control the human passions through self-denial, mortification and asceticism.  This was essential to Jansenists because they feared that if they could not demonstrate control of the passions, they had not really been chosen by God for salvation after all.  A person predestined to salvation, it was thought, will act in a certain way.  

Many priests and nuns coming from Ireland in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were trained in the French theology and spirituality method [of Jansenism].  Too many Catholics were taught to be a suffering people, estimating how many days their aches and pains would get them out of Purgatory.  The joy and love of a savior who loves us was missing."
"This article appears reasonable on the surface but it is forgetting one very important point -- they do teach us that drinking makes it more likely that we will be assaulted.  Never leave your drink unattended, keep track of your friends, text your friends when you get home safely, don't walk home alone, especially when you've been drinking.  Until recently, we have been telling women how to keep themselves safe and have not been focusing on educating people on issues like consent and respecting a woman's right to act however she likes and still be completely justified in saying no.  Don't worry, women still know that they're risking being victims every time they drink.  We would just like to not have to be scolded at our court cases."

"They didn't fail BECAUSE they were women. They just failed - miserably and just about immediately. Draw your own conclusions on experience, savvy, leadership, etc. The Getty Ritz's and Del Maestros failed as well - for their own reasons. The appointment of very inexperienced people to cabinet - heavily weighted in favour of gender was very risky, if not naive. And where was the support and communications expertise BEHIND these women - to help them NOT make mistakes. Or perhaps it was just the dog's breakfast of policies that they were handed. Roll it all up and you're looking at a very disappointing government - showcased by Trudeau's ""ers"" and ""uhs"" once he gets off his monotonous talking points."

"Well real love isn't a feeling. It's not something to fall in or out of. 
That's the corruption of the grand idea of love that has happened over the last 50-60 years.   We've been led to believe it's a feeling, an emotion.

But the love Jesus taught was a love of the will, a decision made daily to seek another's greatest good, despite good or lackluster feelings. God often blesses us with ""experiences"" of warmth but very often he asks us to love anyway!

The 20th century French playwright and mystic Gabrielle Bossis wrote in her prayer journal (entitled ""He and I""):   May 30 - Lyon. - ""Is it love when my heart beats more quickly when I think of You?"" ""Yes, it is love. But it's also love when you make an effort to be good for My sake without the slightest pleasurable feeling. Have I ever overburdened you with work? Or taken more than you could give? I measure everything.""
It's an insidious thing...seeking the reciprocal feeling as we ""pour ourselves into the life around us""."

"The name of every single church in Christendom dedicated to a saint can be understood to include the idea of ""memorial,"" even if the word is not expressed. By dedicating a church to, say, Ste-Thérèse de Lisieux, we're partly declaring, ""Let us remember this admirable holy woman!""

But the example you give is an interesting one, viz. a dedication to the memory of someone who is admirable (not necessarily by strictly ""religious"" measures) but has not been canonized. There can't be many places like that!, so I am glad to know of this one."

"Abortion supporters always do this--that is--introduce Red Herrings in order distract from the issue.

Right now, the discussion is abortion, not the legal penalties for the crime.  We can't discuss what legal penalties should be given for this crime until we agree that it is, in fact, a crime.  Right now you don't believe abortion is murder. How can we discuss the law when you think abortion isn't a crime? 

However, in answer to your question: I would say that the law should treat this like every other murder--that is--take into account the circumstances surrounding the crime, etc.  I would also say that the doctor who performs the abortion should likely go to jail as the doctor is directly responsible for the life.

The law already does this anyway.  If a pregnant women is killed, the murderer is charged with two murders: mother and child.   

This is not the rocket science you are trying to make this out to be. It is only rocket science because people want it to be."
"The Association For Computing Machinery (ACM) adopted a Canon of Ethics which reminds members that they must identify when they are expressing an opinion not supported by formal training or working experience. 

My daughter had to constantly correct her grade 7 math teacher, while winning the Regional Gauss Math Test Gold Medal for 3 years in succession. 

Being a Science teacher does not necessarily mean that you have a science degree or training. It may just mean that you are trying to teach by rote, using the course and curriculum materials provided to you.

My daughter ended up with an excellent Senior Secondary Physics Teacher. Her older brother had a different teacher earlier in the same school and told us that it seemed as though his Physics teacher didn't understand the material he was teaching. We had to bite our tongues and give him the benefit of our High School and University level Physics training to overcome his teacher's subject knowledge deficit. -)"

"He was using her as an example of the slanted priorities of the media. Trump's problems with his female accusers have been given way more exposure in the mainstream press than Hillary's many scandals and lies. The sheer volume of her scandals, as well as the serious ramifications to our country, dwarf anything Trump may have done.
Enabling her husband's misbehavior is just one item on long list of corrupt behavior. Her actions have had national implications just from the standpoint of equal justice under the law and competence in office. Not to mention the security risks she exposed the country to.
Notice the the latest wikileaks revelation exposing collusion between the Clinton campaign and super pacs and government agencies (illegal), and lying all the way to the top. They have already been subordinated to this article about a Fox News food fight, Many of Trumps problems, as well as a Hillary puff piece about her time in Alaska, were top of the page headlines for days."

"I was responsible for a specialty dementia unit for many years.  One of the things that struck me was how calm people became once they stopped fighting the disease, and how they, too, lived in the moment. Initially they would struggle to remember what happened before and what was to come. It caused a great deal of stress and apprehension, and medication was often required to ease their anxiety. But as the illness progressed and people stopped fighting, they began to live in the moment too. They could still enjoy a sunny day, a joke, the relaxing power of music and a kind word. One of the most fascinating things to see was how a group of women with Alzheimer's interacted with each.  They sat round a table, smiled and chatted.  Everything looked normal until you actually listened to the conversation which never made the slightest sense. Yet they were socializing and pleasantly passing the time living from moment to moment."
"The image of the typical arrogant smirk on Clarks face in today's Vancouver Sun and Province tells the whole story and I believe is the essence of who this woman truly is. She could care less what any average British Columbian thinks of her or what she does while in office. She is flipping the bird to all of us and she could not care less. She needs to write the word ""humble"" backwards on her forehead so that she is reminded every time she looks in a mirror."

"I challenge your challenge and up the ante: there are so, so many gay clerics. Tom Doyle estimates some 50%, others 30%.  
I also doubt if you can separate actual conditions from church teaching, since that bifurcates the church teaching from peoples' lives in a rather gnostic fashion. Isn't the church semper reformada. Didn't Pope Francis just say that again? Any church institution that is entirely irreformable seems to me to be dead, clinging to the skeleton of a past glory while ignoring the needs of presently living people.
Why do you say other churches have heterodox eucharistic theologies? Anglo-Episcopalians enjoy both high church theology and a plethora of women priests. You must be thinking of those who swam the Tiber a few years back, eh?"

I will practice my profession conscientiously, with dignity, and in keeping with the principles of veterinary medical ethics...""

The woman didn't violate her oath--she upheld its most important provisions (CAPITALIZED), with the possible exception of the 'dignity' part for being stupid enough to brag about it on FaceBook, and inevitably sending the cat-nutters and other weak, worthless weeble-wobbles into paroxysms of shrieking and flailing.

I think that what is bad is the  sexual discrimination that exists.  Once women are able to serve in all capacities in the institutional Church, then this issue will be addressed."

"I think talent should be encouraged. Women are often told that the sciences make them less feminine. Having studied in multiple schools around the world, I think that subtle discouragement of women going into sciences is higher in Canada (and probably the USA).

"Most zygotes are never implanted into a uterus, they simply escape the woman's body onto clothing or toilet.  A zygote is not a person.  The idea that a zygote, morula, or fetus is any more completely human than a liver  or liver cell is appalling.  Each tissue and cell possess all the human DNA.  Slavery has nothing to do with abortion.  Your exaggeration of horrific procedures do not take into consideration the some outcomes without abortion are terribly bad.  

All that said, I do not like abortions and would like to see them ""legal but very rare.....""  For this position I have been called pro abortion.  I stand with Hillary Clintons words above and would remind you that she seems more Christian than do those who severely criticize her.

"Basically, you answered, “Let the fat lady fend for herself.” 

No, she didn't.  She let the LWs know that she was not their responsibility, which she is not.  They can set any boundaries they want, including doing nothing for that lady.  They didn't agree to be her caretakers when they bought the condo.

There are things that I can't do for myself because of physical injuries I received years ago, and guess what?  I pay other people to do them!

"She hasn't done enough to speak out against the violence and most of the people given Nobel Peace Prizes like Obama, Suu Kyi and others are not very deserving of their Peace Prizes. It is more symbolic than anything else.

Certain people want only Christians protected but not others. That shows we want only like-minded people protected and not others. I think everyone should be protected but the news is very selective also in what stories get presented, and I mean that in that there are distractions but this is a legitimate story that needs attention that has not received attention for years.

Another important story not receiving attention is the massacre of Palestinians on a regular basis in the Middle East. A lot on the right wing support Israel in everything it does, including the complete destruction of Gaza and even women and children killed by settlers and the IDF. These are facts that can be easily checked."
"Late last year, at a 7-11, I waited several minutes for a woman at the register to finish up. She was a larger woman and I gave her room to get by. Then another woman that was part of a large group at the back walks up in front of me and lays her stuff down. I got closer and told her she cut in front of me. She grabbed her card from her purse, scanned it, and with a wave of the hand, told me, ""oh, well, too late and it's not a big deal."" I said it was when I've waited and don't have time to waste.

She then laid into me, calling me the usual assorted white insults, yelling quite loudly and publicly, but as amusing as they were, the one that had me laughing was ""pig"", I'm not sure what she was deranged about by then. It made her more upset I continually called her racism out and failed to respond in kind, like I imagine she hoped.

2 weeks later, a few women in that group saw me, and apologized. It wasn't their guilt to carry and I let them know.

Racism isn't exclusive to any race."

2) something more broad based than CRTC would have greater probabilty of success. The new chief out there reports it preety grim, they need viabl product to sell more than anything else. 
3) who is the attractive woman in the photo?"
"Yep! That hog is definitely tied!   

Oops! I used a Trump word to describe a female!  Mea culpa! Mea Culpa!   Mea maxima culpa!

Question.  Is it a 'hate' crime ""to direct slurs related to sexual orientation at the officers as she was taken to the jail.""?   

Do they actually have to BE an actual member of the 'protected class' that is being maligned?  How do they prove in court that they are one?  Or is just calling them one of those slurs enough for it to be a 'hate' crime?  

 This PC stuff is so confusing!"
"The one thing women hate more than being talked about, is not being talked about."
I would argue that Churches are very often and unfortunately actually abusive...rather than just negative. Jesus would not approve.
"I am really proud of Civil Beat.  Seems like a great program that is much needed, and you brought in three women.  Seems like women are underrepresented in the newsrooms here.  I took note of Ka Leo doing a good job, and who the editor was, and sure enough there she is in the program.  Kudos Patti."
"Any soldier, military pilot, firefighter, or policeman and other professions knows the risk when he or she joins the profession.  They certainly know ""what they signed up for"" and all the risks inherent to the job. In that respect, President Trump (if he did say this) was complementing the heroism of the dead soldier. The media every day speaks of ""laying their lives on the line every day"".  The saddest thing is the congress woman making a political issue out of the heroic death of this fine soldier in an attempt to bring down our Commander in Chief. She and her ilk are disgusting and immoral."
If a car mounts the sidewalk then clearly it's the driver's fault unless something forced her car onto the sidewalk. However I am appalled and horrified the way some pedestrians cross the road here in Edmonton. I have seen young women with prams and/or toddlers walking along with them crossing at a crosswalk and not looking to see if anything is coming. That's stupid.
"You don't bring medieval anti-women rituals to a modern society.

"It certainly makes sense for Ms. Knight to insist people identify her as black, by virtue of her mother's origin.  That way, she gets to claim the many benefits and entitlements of victimhood.  If Ms. Knight were identified as South Asian - not entirely unreasonably since that's her father's origin - she'd be just another un-special person who would have to make her way in the world based on merit."
"But to be fair we have recently had a non-white French speaking woman with Ms. Jean.  Depending on whether you consider Adrienne Clarkson to be white or not, you could argue that the last white woman in the role was Jeanne Sauve and she was appointed 33 years ago."
"Wow.  This is getting complicated.

A white skinned woman with an afro leading the NAACP gets called out and ridiculed for self-identifying as black, even though she lived/breathed ""black"" and advocated for the race exhaustively.

Someone with 1/64th aboriginal lineage can claim Indigenous status, but someone else who knows aboriginal cultures quite well can't even write fiction about it (let alone wear a Halloween costume) without being accused of ""cultural appropriation"".  

Yet it's fine to pick and choose your gender, or lack of gender, or fluid gender, or whatever, and this is somehow a legal right?

If gender is indeed a social construct, independent of biology, then how can race be any different?"

"This trial is important for other women who deal with this crap every damn day of their lives. We need to see a woman stand up against sexual assault and speak her truth. It's unfortunate that the only women who can do that are rich, famous, and powerful. In this country rapists are let off with a slap on the wrist because it might ""ruin their lives."" No wonder women are afraid to report assaults."

"Sphere Music,

   I agree with you to some extent.
  But they were predominantly women talking women's issues. Why? Who organized the marches? And why did they call them Womens Marches? Anyways they're all over now, baby blue.
  If I was organizing a protest I would keep it simple, straight forward and punchy. I would unite the  80% of Americans who didn't vote for Trump. I would call for impeaching Trump and running Bernie Sanders for President."
"In answer to your #2:

Of course not, silly! Freedom & Liberty only apply toward moving things in a Left direction! What planet have you been on these past decades?!
Tobacco smoke, well THAT (including cigars, and e-cigs, too!) be outlawed as damaging and harmful to innocent bystanders. But pot, oh heck no.

This is how it works:
See, the Left eats its own. Pot culture is an oppressed Leftist minority. Legalizing pot is a victory for that minority. ANYTHING anyone does to stymie that is verboten. Period. Therefore, even if you were to try and cite second-hand (pot) smoke precedence - which is very Left - you'd be shot down. If you cite children being affected - also very Left -  you'd still be shut down. If you cite little girls being affected - VERY, VERY Left, female AND child - ... nope, you'd still be shut down. Left eats own.

Proof is Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Somali pro-woman, anti-Islam activist. She was darling of Left as pro-woman UNTIL she became anti-Islam's treatment of women."
"Let me allay your fears. No one is going to complain if you tell your kids those things. It would be appropriate to say something like, ""As Michelle Obama said, 'blah bah blah'"" if you decide to quote her almost word for word, though.

The uproar part is more because of the juxtaposition of having the GOP nominee's wife use the words of a person who is probably one of the top 10 most reviled public figures in that convention hall. Couldn't she have ripped off Nancy Reagan?"
"Anyone who says I don't watch Fox except....YOU WATCH FOX.  Okay, maybe you're not a moron, but your hypothetical is moronic.  Better?  Amazing how your MAGAphants remain obsessed with all these private citizens.  Okay, so you remain obsessed with the daughter of a private citizen so I'll answer your first question: Yes, I think Chelsea Clinton would have gone straight to the FBI.  That should make your Fox-News-watching head explode."
"...seems like “He was like my little girlfriend calling me all the time."" was a quote worth leaving out of the article."
Thank you Bishop Stowe and again thank you to New Ways Ministry for actually being Christian.    It seems to be getting harder and harder for many in  the Church hierarchy to understand what the Gospel is about with regard to gays and women.
"Truth and Reconciliation is very much like the Palestinian-Israel peace process. The powerful don't want change.
Ditto ending homelessness, building affordable housing, raising the minimum wage, establishing a guaranteed annual income, raising the welfare rates, ending child poverty, changing the election process, legalizing marijuana, addressing equal pay for women, etc, etc.
The rich and powerful drag it out long as possible until they're forced to change., hundreds of years down the road."
"Damn if you do, and damn if you don't!  You go girl!"
"What a racist remark by the RG.  Whatever Trump does for the ""white working class"", it applies equally to the black working class.  And, FYI, Trump got 42% of the female vote.  My respectometer for the RG just went sub zero."
What on earth are you thinking? That is a very good and informative video. The woman does a very good job and brings forward a very objective opinion on a very important subject.
"Mrs. Trump is a beautiful, classy and cultured woman.  Unlike a former First ""Lady"" who I will not name but her initials are Waldo Clinton.  Waldo as First Lady  came across as bossy, angry, classless and not very lady-like.  By the grace of god Waldo and her sleazy spouse were sent packing so we don't have to be exposed to her cackling phony laughter,  condescending tone and hazmat suit wardrobe.  And now despite the progressives and and the mainstream media's best efforts Mrs. Trump's popularity is skyrocketing lending credibility to the President.  The progressive nightmare continues, #MAGA!"

"Tragically, this practice of abduction is common for the Copts in Egypt, and I suspect the same in many Muslim societies. An Egyptian bishop described the status quo recently on Catholic TV's program, ""Where God Weeps.""

The Christian families often know where the daughter is, but the authorities will not act. The Christians are afraid of repercussions if they do rescue or try to rescue their daughters."

"""I've never known a woman, or met a woman, who have ever used Planned Parenthood."" Is that because you're sterile?"
"It appears to be settled in the Catholic theology of orders that Holy Orders consists of deacon, priest, and bishop. All three receive an indelible mark by the sacrament, all three are included in the clergy unlike the women of old. However, the deacon is not ""sacerdotal"", able to perform sacrificial functions. Clarifying that was the purpose of Omnium in mentem.

This was accomplished by revising Canon 1008 and adding a third paragraph to Canon 1009:

""§3. Those who are constituted in the order of episcopate or presbyterate receive the office and faculty of acting in the person of Christ the Head, while deacons receive the power to serve the people of God in the diaconia of liturgy, word and charity."""

"Back in the nineties I worked overnight at a grocery chain stocking shelves. When five o'clock in the morning came, the Howard Stern show was broadcast over the speaker system in the store. I found it totally distasteful , demeaning to women and many other segments of our society. Donald Trump was a frequent visitor on the show. Him and Stern yucked it up, describing their many conquests of women. Eventually, I became the manager in charge and started to receive complaints from the few women who arrived early in the morning. Eventually after talking to upper management, we were able to shut down the Stern show at the store. It truly amazed me that after the Access Hollywood tapes were released and many women came forward to talk about Trump and his sexual assaults, he still got elected president. Many of the women coming forward now were silent at the time. The women who came forward were threatened by Trump with lawsuits, which never came about. This has been going on too long."
"Did you know that the Jewish Talmud says that a fetus is not a person before birth? If you agree with that belief, as Clinton does, there is no contradiction between supporting a woman's right to choose and opposing the death penalty.

Clinton said that Trump mocking the disabled reporter showed ""disrespect"". Could you have misread it?"

"Pres. Trump couldn't have picked a better person for this job, she is awesome at it. I read the article when it came out and  I thought it was really good in the exception of the one paragraph as stated above,  not because of the soccer mom rather his image. Trump's choice of way selecting. This should prove his way of thinking isn't what you think it is. He wants the best for the job. She reminds me Proverbs 31 woman Beauty inside and out and you can't ask for anything better than that."
"You have a point. Drive by a middle or high school when school is getting out in the spring when the weather warms up. There is nothing resembling a dress code, and you will see girls wearing next to nothing, no kidding! If one parent complains about dress code the whole idea is dropped. The whole environment is more geared toward kids' self-expression than school as a serious place of learning."

"If the Securitas security guard approached in the manner reported - the dog perceived a threat and went into defensive mode.  Defending it's family - the woman and child.  Also - a chained or leashed dog will react in a ""flight or fight"" fashion as it feels it cannot escape.  I'll await further investigation and facts before making up my mind.  YMMV"
"It's monstrous that this is happening to girls anywhere at all.  Although this article focuses on Christian girls in Pakistan, the fact is that girls in many parts of the world are at risk of horrendous mistreatment and abuse.  One of our major allied, Saudi Arabia, treats women horribly.  
We need to fight for the rights of women worldwide.  The abuse of women falls on a wide spectrum.   Although all religions call for the respect of women, this is often not implemented in practice.  Like many, I believe that not recognizing women as truly equal is, in many cases, leads to the persecution of women."
"Why don't Saudi Arabia. Egypt, UAE, Bahrain and some of the rich gulf states take some of these Muslim refugees?

Why is it that the west has to shoulder everything? 

Why are you Muslims so entitled? You don't have a right to enter the US unless you are a citizen. Why do you beat women, teach your children to hate Jews, Christians, atheists, gays, and everyone else who is not of your particular branch of Islam. 

And I'm not some Christian Biggot. I'm an atheist who believes in upholding western values of tolerance. Islam by definition is not tolerant."

It is our duty to speak out and set an example for Canadians in confronting stereotypes and prejudice, and advancing understanding and education.

We are horrified by reports that two Imams in Montreal and Toronto called for the death of Jews during sermons. We condemn such behaviour and call on the mosques’ administration to take appropriate action.

We are equally troubled by reports of hate notes posted outside identifiable Jewish homes in Toronto this past weekend, as well as deeply concerning accounts from university campuses of Jewish students being targeted and vilified. Anti-Semitism is real and we must stand together against i"
"I recall a few Alaskan politicians getting jail time for crimes.  So we're to vote for ""anyone"" but Trump because of naughty talk?  Are you saying that we should embrace the criminality of Hillary Clinton? Exactly what message would that be sending to those that want good government and not necessarily polite (read fake) speech.  The last, desperation distraction tactic of a failed ideology is what many people see in the release of the purported recording.  The people who were NOT going to vote Trump are quite possibly the only ones who think this has relevance to the real issues of foreign policy, the economy and the quickly expanding illegal immigration problems.  I would never argue that women aren't abused and disrespected but is this a new problem? Bill Clinton proved that it is not a new problem - did we as a nation deal with it and him?  We did not."
"This is an interesting topic for Nate Nehring to take on right before the general election. His stance on this issue is not rooted in science or best practices, but rather a political calculation that plays on people's fears about the drug crisis. In contrast, his opponent Ray Miller is a drug counselor who has helped many people rehabilitate from drug addiction and understands what works and what doesn't work when it comes to tackling this growing problem. It is also very interesting he raises the issue at a time when nobody has suggested using safe injection sites. His announcement comes across as poorly thought out political grandstanding that I suspect will do more to raise the profile of his more experienced opponent."
"Equating buying pants/your neighborhood with deliberately joining Fundie Baptist church as an adult is gonzo.  There are limits to tolerance, you know.  Jules Bailey believes in female submission, that gay sex is sinful and that Pastor McKinley talks to a sky god.  And, Bailey doesn't have the guts to affirm the church's doctrine or explain why he doesn't attend a less bigoted denomination.
Bailey tithes to a bigoted church because he supports their fundie Baptist message.  Giving money for an obnoxious golf shirt is not ""tithing""."

"I agree with the author that Mr. Trudeau and his government took 180 degree turn when pushed hard by the rich and their representative MP's. They increased the gap between the personal tax rates and the corporate tax rates. As they say, money talks. Did it ever talk. It talked while hiding behind the female doctors. No lawyer, accountant, or other professionals showed their faces, just the female doctors. Believe you me that a tax cut for small business corporations is not a tax cut for working stiffs. A cut in personal taxes might have been a tax cut for the middle class workers provided its benefit could be limited to just them.

To conclude , the government has made matters worse, not better for the average Joe and much better for the rich hiding in small business person's attire.  Bravo!"
"It boggles my mind that an illegal alien can be under a deportation order, convicted of a felony, can produce a child that is then considered a US citizen.

We need a case on that 14th amendment to clarify this - This woman was here illegally, was not WANTED here, as evidenced by her deportation order and is violating our laws. How can any of her children be considered citizens under these circumstances?"
That won't happen. Woman want equality in employment but only in the jobs they like.

"""In fact, if he had supported Gore, the election wouldn’t have even been close."" 

Have to disagree with you on that Hugh. We had good reasons for not voting for Gore. Before he discovered global warming, which I'll give him a lot of credit for, Gore was another Bill Clinton, a conservative pro-business southern Democrat hawk, only without Clinton's political skill. During Clinton's first term Gore wanted to reduce Social Security benefits. He had to be told that the typical SS recipient was an old woman who barely made ends meet. 

He was a lousy candidate who didn't even carry his home state of Tennessee. Nader was not to blame for Gore's defeat, which was deserved. A lot of us were sick to death of the Clinton presidency by 2000, and we were not going to vote for its continuation by Gore. Nor will we vote for a repeat by Hillary Clinton. We are revolting against business as usual, as we did in 2000. The Democratic party can move left or die."
"I haven't seen anything indicating this is a done deal, only that Trump intends to nominate her. She wouldn't be my first choice either.

One of the problems with Catholicism (and I am Catholic) is the whole pesky repentance/forgiveness thing. We're not allowed to shun or devalue sinners (Dang it!).

Another problem is the concept that we are more than the sum of our parts, that our abilities and skills are not defined only by our past, that we are capable of extreme growth and change. We see it all through the New Testament. Jesus chose fishermen, rebels, adulterers, Semaritians, tax collectors and other sinners to go and create a global community (without Facebook!) and they did. Any list of Catholic Saints is full of sinners who turned their lives around and changed their corner of the world for the better. MIght Calista Gingrich be able or inclined to do the same? 

As I said, she isn't my choice either, but she might be accepted for reasons beyond her sins."

"Racism, like all  ""isms"", is a learned behavior.  They all stem from a world view that is dualistic: we/they.  Until we learn to get beyond the illusion of separateness, and experience the reality that we are all one, racism, jingoism, fascism - even feminism - will continue to divide and conquer us.  A huge change of consciousness is required to make any progress here.  I think a requirement for being a bishop should be 6 months in solitude leaning contemplative prayer."
"The dog was clearly out of its property. Its body was across the property line, so the sonic fence wasn't a deterrent.

We owned a beautiful black Lab for 15 years who thought it was her job as family dog to rush the FENCED property line when people walked too close. A woman pepper sprayed her once because she feared Kana would come over that fence. Kana meant no harm. She was bluffing and she never went over the fence, but she was big, black and scary and the woman had a little kid with her. I could see why it happened. Kana learned not to rear up on the fence because of that incident.

We have since had a Lab husky mix who would and did ignore a sonic fence to intimidate other dogs. We recognized her as a potential threat to herself if not to children and dogs, so we installed a real fence of substantial height to keep her in.

The owners of this dog were negligent with the life of their dog. This was bound to happen sooner or later. Aggressive dogs should be fenced with real fences!"

After one hour my daughter was outed as the informant despite being told this was an anonymous tip, and was targeted for harassment from students and administration of the school. I met with the SSO (The police) and Vice Principal to review their policy for her safety and removed her from that school that day. I went to a lawyer and was told 30,000 to get started on a suit that would last years. There is a unwritten code of silence because in South Metro Denver we are one of the best places to live.

If they vote Liberal, they languish in opposition ranks and their days at the trough are done.

If they vote NDP, they will be rewarded with a guaranteed Cabinet Post, and will remain at the government trough for years to come.

Seeing as most voters are Liberal, I bet that they vote NDP to stay at the government trough."

"She tolerates you infidel only as much as her job requires. She is probably really helpful to other Muslims and thus seems to be doing a great job.

"The only reason we put up with Rome is to author the rites. Even a Catholic Leftist like me knows that. Still, if there is enough heart burn with the Ratzinger liturgical camp, expect pressure for an independent English Langauge Patriarch to take these functions. So far, I have not seen such pressure. Maybe over female ordination."
"CAEL - I did find it oppressive and depressing - both the book and the 1990 movie.  I think the story was/is important as a counter view to those who think the change in women's position in society has gone too far, ""strayed from the Biblical"", leads to the decline of the family, and all the things people have come up with to oppose changes that have made tens of millions of women's lives better.  

I have to admit, I have not reread the book in years and I am not watching the series.  Just seeing those characters enfleshed by actors once was more than enough.  I am, however, following commentary on it because I want it to upset people, especially with so much political power in the hands of the far right."

"As noted, there have been five possible options for rail funding presented to Legislative leaders to solve this issue. I think a sixth one should be put on the table. This option will finally put the onus of paying for this project right on the people that it affects - the members of the City and County of Honolulu, and keeps the neighbor islands out of the weeds. To boot, it would also take the Legislature out of the business of dealing with this problem. 
The solution? Eliminate the laws that limit the sources of income for the Counties. Give the counties full authority to tax all sources. Then we won't have this kabuki theater of the Counties going to the legislature and doing the ""mommy may I"" performance while the Legislators try to wring their hands of the issues the counties create for themselves - like rail. 
Time to put the responsibility of fixing this problem on the right people - The City Council and not the State Legislature."
"I equate you with Adolf Eichmann because you espouse the same ethos: Your superiors speak, therefore you must obey! This is morally objectionable since it is actually sinful, a sin of sloth. It is being slothful because having someone else make moral decisions for you is abdicating responsibility.

I do give the teachings ""careful, prayerful consideration"". This is not a stock phrase, it is the truth. Sneering at this is not a meaningful response.

I QUESTION the teaching on abortion. It is simplistic, and based on the OPINION that a blastocyst is a fully-fledged human being. I do like something more to base a moral judgment on than someone's unsupported opinion. Also, I have known women who have been impregnated through rape and incest. All of these women have wanted abortions, and believed that telling them no is punishing them for having been raped. How would you respond to them?

You don't know how consciences are formed? That's your problem."
"You're missing the salient point here - that her opposition to Trump was opportunistically picked up on as her ONLY beef with HRP.  This in and of itself should have been and was enough to have her removed from the position of minority caucus leader, at least.  But since 2012 she has consistently facilitated the opposing agenda with her legislative actions and in fact for at least two years has vocally and publicly indicated her desire to switch parties.  Until party leadership exists that will condemn this type of behavior, the party itself will be eaten alive from the inside.  Some would venture a guess that this is the design in place."

And now, somehow, failing to provide on-demand abortions on par with punching a woman in the face?

Only from the mouth of a politician."
"WHAT???? What are you saying about women? Very sexist. I know many women who can deal with danger and scary situations. As a matter of fact, they seem to thrive on it."
"This is just the beginning what the world is facing is a population explosion.
Presently the world has 7.3 billion people by 2097 it will be (estimated UN agency) 11.2 billion people. Majority of the growth in Africa, Muslim world and the Sub-continent of India. Nigeria has the highest growth with 12 children per woman, lowest is Italy, Greece and Japan at 1 child.  Medical aid and food is being flooded into these areas from Western nations. Majority in Africa and Muslim world refuse any form of birth control."
she's still under investigation   hahaha
"True Conservative, 
I agree people should take responsibility for their actions, particularly when it comes to bringing children into the world. Health insurance can provide women with birth control. ANMC and Planned Parenthood hand out free condoms. And, there are somewhat reliable methods for those who do not use birth control for religious reasons. Abstinence isn't a bad idea either. But, I want to make it clear, more white people are on welfare than minorities."
"Flagged.  How did this comment get through the sensors?  It is an outright personal attack.  

And I've witnessed people being ""tattled"" on all the time.  It seems pretty common among conservative Catholics, especially the ""pious Catholic mommy"" set.  Some women have never left high school.  

And many remarried people don't receive Communion now.  Most just leave the Catholic Church discouraged.  Some go to Protestant churches but most become lapsed and angry.  I don't know of one Catholic divorced person who has successfully received an annulment or has decided to remain an active Catholic.  All Pope Francis is doing is acknowledging the reality and finding a better way to reach such people.  If the Catholic Church was healthy, Amoris Laetitia would be uncontroversial, but the last two popes gutted the Church to such an extend that there is no room for pastoral care, only fundamentalist adherence to the rules."

"Sean Hannity has lost all credibility long ago, particularly since he became a mindless Trump sycophant.  There's no ""news"" there, it's all just Sean promoting his favorite leader. But his support of Roy Moore is unconscionable, and an insult to the women who were victimized.  Hannity would so better to ask himself:  what if my sister, my niece, my mother or my female friend made that accusation?  Then he might grow some empathy and humanity, which are sorely lacking in his current poltically-tinged statements."

Not even the amount it cost to replace just one planes tires.    That ranks right up there with the woman who owned a diner up north and lost over 5o grand cash and only offered the honest person who turned it in a free meal.   Granted , people should turn the person ( s) who did it because it's the right thing to do , but to offer that chump change---that's an insult and slap in the face of honesty .   Given the number of planes damaged , evidence ( tire tracks , foot prints etc. ) should have been everywhere. It should have been solved within two days."

"And Trump never raped,  assaulted or harassed any women, right?"
Please contribute to this Good Woman!
While there are certainly viable facts reported in this  article one must remember that work  ethics have dropped hence officers are not motivate or conscienous.  Within the RCMP the sexual abuse has been  rampant. For decades the in-grained attitudes allowed all forms of sexual abuse towards female offices with no punishment let alone  being fired.  Thus are errant officers investigating external sexual assault cases unbiased?
"Hope they find this little girl safe, ASAP!"
"As our newly 'selected' president assumes office we can expect an increasingly toxic culture. It is that culture, our social environment, which is a factor in individuals willingness to add to the next generation by having children. Witness the 900% increase in IUDs  to women by Planned Parenthood since Trump was elected.  It is no surprise that the number of births increases and abortions decrease when our political leaders attempt to bring us together rather than divide us. They set the tone whether our culture is accepting and open or exclusive and closed. That is why abortions decreased under Clinton and Obama while increasing under Reagan and both Bushes."

"Spilde's dictatorship started its ongoing reign of 'terror' about 3 months after she assumed the presidency. Examples include: 1. A manager received an invitation to attend & present at the highly regarded Oxford Roundtable on a topic that this individual was & is an acknowledged expert. Spilde vetoed the trip, 2. The same manager received the same invitation the next academic year & the result was the same, 3. Through an E-Mail vote, the same manager applied & was accepted as 1 of the management representatives to sit on the important College Council. Spilde, through 1 of her sycophantic women managers, cancelled the vote & called a new election. Needless to say, this individual sat that one out, 4. Spilde attempted to force this manager to help turn the then VP for Instruction and Student Services against another woman Division Chair, 5. Spilde sat on her hands, and thus allowed, Dr. Derek Mpinga to be harassed by staff, to the point, that Mpinga left. Is that enough granularity?"
"Shallow thinking.  Spoon feeding is not the same as tube feeding or intravenous feeding.  Spoon feeding means that the person is conscious enough to open their mouth and voluntarily swallow food.  Any person whose arms are paralyzed or even just broken would need spoon feeding, i.e. assistance of others in obtaining the food even though they may have no desire to die.  Likely a person whose arms became paralyzed and had signed a no-tube, no-intravenous feeding directive would not expect it to lead to them starving to death.  The story does not provide sufficient information to judge.  In one sense, the woman consents to continued life by accepting and swallowing the food.  A person needing tubes, etc. does not give consent, the tube is forced in and no voluntary action takes place."
Weird and gross to assume she had to be 13. Stop calling women who dont accept your views of sexual assault naive. It makes your arguments seem weak and unsubstantial
"Look to the norm of Children of Western Cdn Society.. Human Babies first look to recognize the 'Human Face'; in particular a smiling 'Human Face'; a biological imperative for our Human species.

"This post is borderline, at best.  ""Mongrel,"" applied to a woman, certainly suggests ""bitch,"" which is what countless T-shirts at Trump rallies openly call Mrs. Clinton.

""Mongrel"" is also offensive because it implies adulterated ancestry, i.e., that an individual is inherently inferior because of his or her ancestry.  That's one baby step away from racism.

And, as perhaps you've noticed, you don't know how to spell ""mongrel."""
"I don't understand your response to my statement.
In regards to Weinstein, sure some may have had sex with him because they sought reward. But a 16 year-old like Reese Witherspoon was forced by a director. Do you think she was capable of making an adult choice so it was her decision? 
Do you believe that women in Hollywood were coerced to have sex so their could have a career? If you believe that, do you think it is OK?

I cannot speak for Dean but that was my assumption. It is not just a few.  Those that are sympathetic to the use of violence in the name of Islam are many . More so in Europe but with the large influx of Islamic immigration we will soon have the same issues that Britain, Brussels, France and the rest of Europe are currently having. 

While this is not the case with all of the followers of Islam, a majority do not hold the same values that westerners do, Sharia, subjugation of women, religious pluralism, tolerance of homosexuality etc. ( do not confuse tolerance with acceptance) We shouldn't allow those to emigrate to our country if they do not share our values. Otherwise we'll find our values in jeopardy. There is no reason a country should do that."

If the money (and the cultural willpower) had been available for him to stay in a safe place with knowledgeable people who could guide him until he was stable again, then the woman who loved him would still be alive.    We are penny wise and pound foolish.

"It's imperative that all Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim read this book concerning Islamic reform:

""Heretic  Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali""

Go to your local library and get it.   It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.

Although this ferry carried cars, as we did, for that beautiful smooth ride.  I am not sure the Ferry to Kauai you could bring your car on the ferry.  
   I would hope they bring the ferry back not only for a ride to the island of Kauai but to Maui and the Big island of Hawaii.  Just imagine spending your day or weekend on another island with your own car.

You're right. This is beyond borderline."
"Democrats like JFK and Bill Clinton sexually harassed women, regularly, in office, as the PRESIDENT. Meanwhile feminists are complaining about Trump's behavior as a private citizen, not a politician, not in office, and not currently President yet."

"I understand that Sr. Christine needs to have hope that Francis is improving the situation of women in the Church.  Unfortunately, the facts contradict her position.  As long as women are kept out of the priesthood, we will not be fully equal in the Church.  And as long as the clerical culture is maintained, the Church will suffer.  Francis has done nothing to enable the ordination of women or to dismantle the clerical structure and culture in the Catholic Church.  
Telling women to wait and be patient is no different from what those opposed to dismantling segregation loved telling African Americans -- just be patient, and your time will come ....."
"What ever happened to the work of the Deaconesses? Great examples in the Bible. I agree that there is a huge role for Women in the church. Many do a superb ministry. I do take issue with some of the crazy, wild things I have heard from the mouths of some who have been ordained as they are way out there in some form of new age theology. I was appalled when a young 'lady' studying for the ministry at Andrews showed up at my church to speak one Sabbath wearing a pin stripped man's suit, tie and shoes. The entire church was appalled and our church had two women elders who were very sincere, dedicated Christian Sisters. 
In today's culture it is very difficult  to be biblical in many ways and we will unfortunately see many things creeping into the church to compromise and distract us from our goals. But we need to quit the bickering and get on with the Father's Business on this earth so we can go home. We read about 1/3 of the angels leaving the throne with Lucifer. Let' not be among them."

"Kudos all to her. Obviously my wife and I are proud parents, but the big deal is that she got to pursue her interests without going into debt. How often does that happen to people these days? You keep hearing stories about students graduating with 100s of k$ in debt. Some of my daughter's PhD cohort had college prof parents going into debt to pay for MIT/WHOI Grad tuition. I got off very lightly, just had to subsidise a hatchback she used to move mass specs between the WHOI labs and research ships. -)

Fewer people use cash these days, but I joke that I keep a picture of my daughter's boat in my wallet. She is one of the Scientists who had to postpone flying up to the Arctic this summer because the CCG Amundsen had to divert to help out fishermen. The Amundsen is the Ship on the cdn $50 bill.

"Re. Female Proteas - South Africa, and the rest of the world, need LESS professional sport, not more.

Ordinary people in most developed, and developing countries have become Entertainment Junkies.  Not a week goes by without there being some sport tournament on somewhere in the world, and Sport bodies like FIFA, ICC, NBA, IRF, IOC, IPL etc. are simply basking in the sunshine of this madness.  The fees  paid to sport  'superstars', and sport managers 'boggles the mind'.

""The firms featured in Forbes’ 2016 ranking of the World's Most Valuable Sports Agencies have negotiated a collective $40 billion in current professional athlete contracts, netting themselves more than $1.95 billion in commissions.""

"In addition, it is not the responsibility of the employer to offer what is being termed ""a living wage."" It is the responsibility of the employee to garner the necessary skills to demand more money due to their skill set. Minimum wage was conceived as an entry level wage, designed to teach young people the difference between french fries and boogers, how to act professional in the workplace and to teach them rudimentary skills upon which to grow and become more valuable in the workplace. And while it is obvious many minimum wage workers are not high school students, it's not the employers responsibility or obligation to help solve poor choices made by others. They certainly CAN, but it's not their obligation. McDonald's didn't impregnate your girlfriend and has no responsibility towards that. Business owners, if the business goes down, suffer the loss of everything invested in the business. Workers go down to the next fast food place. It's risk/reward. That is the reality of life."

1. Stakeholder #1: the fetus will continue to term unless there is an intervention. Therefore, we may say that the fetus ""prefers"" to continue the pregnancy and will not/cannot take a different initiative that affects the ethical outcome. (A spontaneous abortion is not an initiative.)
2. Stakeholder #2: the woman is subject to conflicting forces, some of which incline her to carry the fetus to term and some of which incline her to terminate the pregnancy.  Since the actual decision is eventually hers, the question is whether the negative factors can (or should be) neutralized.
3. Stakeholder #3: family/society are also conflicted about the pregnancy, desiring to support both fetus and woman. The questions is whether family/society can resolve the conflicts. (More after dinner is cooked...)"

"I don't agree Mr. Trump is a racist, but racism also exists in all people of all races, black race included.

It's in all races, and today even our universities like Harvard, where Asians are discriminated against.

"""When the Federal Government came to her door and perjury charges were possible, she was forced to tell the truth.""

Thanks for restating the  obvious. Was she forced to tell the truth or forced to tell them what they wanted to hear, like McDougal claimed was happening to her? That's the question: to believe her original signed affidavit, or what she claimed under duress AFTER Starr contacted her? I don't believe anything any one says after their testimony became contaminated under Starr's threats. 

Explain who Spiller is, so everyone knows what you're talking. And if you believe in the trendy ""Rape Victim Trauma"" mind-set psycho-babble, then you must really be aching for all of those women who have currently come forward  to accuse tRump of sexual assault, including the one yet to ID herself, but who claims he raped her when she was only 13-years-old. She cancelled her Press conference due to threats.  How do you feel about all of those women?"

"My question probably arises, because I am not sufficiently familiar with the field. Your requirement that everything arise  from the old is a bit unclear.  Eg - I believe that the Church is dead wrong on its position on gay marriage.

The same can be said for the institutional Church's view on women.

"I mean no disrespect to you, however I could care less if the pope emeritus is offended.  I do not deny the existence of  the sick level of politics and egos in the curia. I could even care less about that.  The rape of children was the biggest scandal to hit the church in the last 40 years.  Everyone in the Vatican that can read a poll knows how important fixing the problems related to the scandal are for the faithful. The world also knows this as the Holy See has been reminded by the UN. about the horrific reality.  Francis approved reporting a blatant lie to the world, telling us that the pope only has control and responsibility for the residents of Vatican City.   Francis knew all about the politics and the scandal when he accepted becoming pope.

"james:

  Warren has been taking the CEO of Wells Fargo to task, and rightly so, but Warren herself has credibility issues, a distinct difficulty with the truth, and she wouldn't indorse anyone else but Hillary, for two reasons, first they are fellow democrats, and they are both female, honesty and integrity simply don't apply.

  While neither party seems to be honest in their dealing with the people's business, they also can't seem to except responsibility for their own shortcomings, it's always the other parties fault, and Hillary simply isn't immune from passing the blame for her's. 
 It would be refreshing for any political candidate to except responsibility, rather than deflect the blame. And no matter the outcome, we the people will end up with more of the same."
"We need  to ban the burqa! It is offensive and denigrates women to the lowest common denominator. I would never want to see my wife or daughter ever be forced to wear such garb. It is very offensive indeed. Wear want you want in your churches, mosques or homes. My Muslim friends say that the burqa is not part of their religion. It is from an outdated cultural backward thinking ideology forced upon women. Especially in Saudi Arabia where their way of life is contrary to the rest of world with respect to women's rights. Why do we even do business with them? Do we need their oil that badly?"
"Wrong girly.  The legislators need to REPEAL BS21.  If legislators can keep tinkering with repealing Roe v. Wade or same-sex marriage, then why the hell can't they REPEAL this ludicrous legislation?  Wake up voters that voted to keep BS21.  This is your doing too."
"“Do you want some grits?”

This comment has absolutely NOTHING to do with anyone's race.  The woman who reported this is completely mistaken in assuming that it is a comment which has any reflection whatsoever on one's race.  Grits are standard fare in the southern parts of the USA.  Grits are NOT eaten, as she seems to assume, only by African-Americans.  Grits are eaten by EVERYBODY.  To judge that a comment about grits is a racist comment is nothing less than profoundly a ignorant judgment.  To judge that speaking a phrase or a sentence with a 'southern accent' is a racist act is also nothing less than a profoundly ignorant judgment."

"Claimed? How about the women who have ""claimed"" tRump assaulted them? One even claimed he forcibly raped her when she was 13, but she declined to come forward due to threats. You need to be consistent about which women you believe. You believe Clinton accusers, but no one else. Why? I have never found any of these women credible without the existence of credible evidence: not the Cosby accusers, Weinstein, even tRump, as much as I hate him. I'm not happy with the direction this trend is going: wait decades and then bring forward charges you can't prove and pile on. I think it actually trivializes the crime of rape if you think an 89yo guy in a wheelchair sexually assaulted you by touching you from behind. Why trivialize a serious crime like rape just to soften the definition so we can have more claims?"
"It is a self-imposed vow, and for diocesans it is a promise.  Because it is related to a misogynistic view of sex, it is a scandal based on stoicism, not the Gospel."
"Nora, it appears that you have not read the report, but are relying on my attempt to condense its 190,000 words into 1400.

"TigerEye,

By some respected estimates, one in six American women will be the victim of outright sexual assault (excluding statutory rape) at least once in her lifetime.  Would you venture to guess how many of these now living victims and potential victims had, or will have, a police officer at her side during an attack?  I'm not at all declaring the deterrence value of organized police forces is zero or non-existant, but I will say that the wry phrase ""when seconds count, the police are only minutes away"" is grounded in a fundamental truth, that an individual's personal safety and protection depends foremost upon herself (or himself, as may be). 

That said, I agree that an armed bodyguard, or better yet, a dedicated armed security detail would be nice when hopping about town or during a sojourn in a place where I don't speak the language - but a Hillary Clinton I am most assuredly not."
Of course. It only proves my point. It took six women to complain before anyone would believe he was sexually abusing them. SIX!! Why not investigate after the first complaint? They cover up and protect they're own.

"While saving the life of a young child from the Islamic State is certainly cause for celebration, lets not get too embroiled in embracing the Yazidi culture.  Yazidis (not unlike the worlds other religions) are chock full of messed up messages for children who are brainwashed from a young age into medievalism.

There were terrible calls in several of the games that almost certainly changed the outcome and the eventual fortunes of the teams involved. Some of the umpires were literally incompetent. The NCAA needs to review these umpires and make some changes.

Until then, no.  My mother would have said it is throwing good money after bad."
"""In a perverse way, piling on Trump is just making him more sympathetic.""

I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's definitely painting some people as monomaniacal and more than a little histrionic. When BBC reporters were begging via Tweets for his assassination, and CNN was discussing, as calm as if they were discussing the weather, what would happen if he were assassinated, and Hollywood startlets were calling for outright armed insurrection ... we had moved well past principled opposition and into a social panic.

How many of those early ""Trump attacks"" have turned out to be people so upset by Trump's election win they fabricated racist and sexist attacks to justify their own emotional response? Multiple Muslim people faked attacks on themselves. A church organist painted swastikas and anti-Jewish slogans on his OWN CHURCH. One woman cut her own face.

"Funny. The rates posted in the G&M for 60 yr old female are about $438 / month for 100 K, or 1,752 K / month for 400 K which is about 21K per year, not 24K, unless the adviser knows where to get better rates.

So that would be about 5.2%

You could probably generate something close to that rate (including stock gains) in the stock market by sticking to safe stocks like the banks. And you'd still have the 400K to spend as well."

Hillary Clinton has maintained her dignity through all of these debates and it must have been incredibly trying for her.  How shocking for her and many Americans of all parties to see a major candidate be so disrespectful while trying to be President.

It really makes one wonder about our culture and the direction that it seems to be taking if this campaign is an indication of what we'll accept as normal behaviour. 

 The Republicans should have never allowed Donald Trump to represent them."
"Until there's some evidence, there is no rape to apologize for. And as far as I can tell, none of these women have accused the guy of rape."
"I am Pro-Choice and anti-abortion but I am guessing that there is a little more to this bill than is covered in this story. Would I and I believe most people like to have a date by which we say, sorry your on your own, I think so? However, here are the little things that crop up, the same Saintly Party that is trying to save fetus's is also the same party that tries to make ALL abortions hare to have like in Texas. It is the same party that tries to actually make it harder for ALL women to get contraception which prevent unwanted pregnancy. I thought that was decided in my MOTHERS era not to bailed today. It is the same party that says no you don't have a right to kill a fetus but by god after its born well you can buy a bazooka and kill as many has you can.  As  Tom Hanks playing Captain Sullenberger says, ""Okay can we get serious now?"" Making abortion illegal or harder does not make it go away, no what it does is turn it into yet another class privilege.guessing"
and women....
"Wait, you forgot the best part:  In an effort to head off the Women's March on Washington (Jan. 21st), the Trump campaign has gobbled up all Park Service permits to assemble in the National Mall for weeks surrounding the inauguration---In effect blocking off all rights of citizen assembly in the nation's most popular spot to protest their government!  Now THAT's insecurity!"
"How dare you call her a ""whore!"" You fucking bitch!! Let me allow you to know what type I am, not hard to find.. guaranteed I've worked harder and raised kids without being a prostitute..

"What does this mean? You think you know what makes women angry, and you think that there is one reason?"
"I am hardly a Trump supporter.  I will always attempt to keep your posts honest as the facts when you are overcome by hyperbole or your emotions, however.  

I don't have to agree with anything anyone says; I just have to vote against the worst of two seriously flawed candidates.  

I am concerned about Hillary (and Bill)  as a serial war monger, serial liar, serial misogynist (against Bill's women) and lack of ethics regarding the source of money for the Clinton Foundation as well as her cozy relationship with the 1% who are funding her campaign.   Her morals in pursuit of the office are virtually non-existent.  

Trump may well be the lesser of two evils this year.  

Income distribution is not my hot button; throwing away lives in the Middle East for no possible gain is."

"Several thoughts and some questions here, if anyone can help! My building is mostly all cinder block! Can we individually just go ahead and install? How will that impede sprinkler installations? Did they not have smoke alarms in the building? Were the elevators working? How do people get out in such a situation? So alarming for older women!!!A tax credit would certainly help a lot!

"TRUMP has promised to dismantle planned parenthood, which has been PROVEN to save hundred of thousands of women, reverse Rhode versus Wade,  build a wall (much like Hitler on BOTH ends of the USA, Canada and Mexico)has disgraced veterans, the disabled, women, immigrants and those who choose to worship!  THIS woman needs to go back to her ELITE life which I may remind her is has been FUNDED by the TAX PAYERS!  #novotesforleitch"
"Trudeau desperately wants to prove himself as a true francophone. Unfortunately, his mother is pure english and that leaves JT  kissing up to quebec to gain the acceptance he so wants (but will never get with that anglo blood flowing in his veins). Radio Canada was saying JT was not sufficiently eloquent in his french language skills to be a true statesman. So I guess cruelly answering in french to a woman suffering mental illness served his true cause of proving himself to quebec."
"Oh pleeeeze!  People voted for Trump because the Donald promised to keep and build up JOBS in the U.S.  Most American Catholics believe that women have the right to decide how an if they want children.  That has been posted on this site and others so often---that it is ridiculous to state otherwise.   Belief in God is not just centered on one or two issues---that some Catholic bishops try to make as #1 issue.  When people begin to see what they're NOT receiving because of Trump's actions, he'll be a one-term president.

Trump isn't religious, you are right about that.  As far as gender identity is concerned---the YOUNG people are in favor of this---and it will only grow in favor with the people.  Trump isn't going to be able to drown that."
"I'm not a Zuma supporter either.  Sex is normally a private act.  How does a court rule between two versions of a sexual act - consensual or non-consensual ?  Eg. If a woman agrees to have sex with someone, and afterwards decide that, for some arbitrary reason, she will lay a charge of non-consensual sex against that person.  How will anyone not having witnessed the episode, (without evidence of violence) be able to decide whether it was consensual, or rape ?  As mentioned by the Prof., status may be the final decider.  That is one of the reasons why in Islamic Sharia, to falsely accuse someone is regarded as a criminal act, and liable to strict punishment."
"What the world is facing is a population problem, according to the UN as of last Thursday the World population is at 7.4 billion. Majority of the growth in Africa and the Muslim world.
By 2095 it is estimated the world population will be 11 billion people and majority of the growth in Africa and the muslim world. Muslim religion will be over 3 billion and the largest and most youthful religion in the world by 2095. Nations like Denmark and Japan have a birthrate of 1.5 while Egypt grows on average of 10 and Nigeria being the highest in the world at 12 children per woman. Just wait it out its a matter of time......"
Treating women as equal is the right thing to do. Saving the planet is the most important thing to do. Believing that those two things are related is naive.
"Your duplicity in the matter is what is really offensive. There are clear cut and demonstrative actions in the Clinton camp to this regard, in the mere utterance of words in the Trump camp. -IF- any woman was unwillingly groped by Trump, I urge them to call the police NOW, and prosecute the case NOW, as there is NO SOL for reporting the crime of sexual assault in NY. In the meantime, by your very definition, Bill's accusers are victims and they are also accusing Hillary of bullying them.  Why won't you listen to them?"
"I don't believe that's what she said.   She said we all view facts through our unique emotional context.  

 We can all read the same article on the Syria missile attack and come up with very different conclusions.    How it that possible if facts are the only input?   Because we all view events from our own frame of reference.  That trait is shared across the political spectrum.     The balance can be found only if you can recognize your own emotions, and you can internally negotiate the facts and your emotional influences.    That not easy or common."
Hard to figure what mothers would leave their child with such people.
"That's actually pretty funny....

For it is the ""women's march"" (not ALL women, btw) that attempted to ""hijack"" the March for Life that began back in 1974.  And it is the ""women's march"" (not ALL women, btw) that attempted to claim representation of women - but refused pro-life women from marching.  So inclusive and justice-driven, right?  :-)

Good try, though...."
"""You are seriously comparing pregnancy with the flu?""

No, I am comparing things like Endometriosis, which are prevented or reduced by hormone therapy, to the flu. My post was in reply to a post explicitly responding to ""Many women use this hormone treatment to control their menstrual cycles for reasons beyond birth control."" You are seriously somehow getting pregnancy prevention from that? Going to such lengths to try to score some sort of rhetorical point against your imagined ""collectivists"" just makes you look bad."

"The issue is not whether Christ is present to sinners.  He is.  Thank God, as we are all sinners.  Rather, the issue is the meaning of his presence.  For that we go to the famous scene in John's gospel.  Jesus rebukes the adulterous woman's accusers and extends mercy to her.  Then he tells her to go -- AND SIN NO MORE!  There is no contradiction between his forgiveness and his command.  As with the woman, so with all of us.  I guess, come to think of it, that by commanding the woman to change her behavior and reform her life, mean old Jesus was a...<gasp>....rigorist."
"Fundamentalists of all stripes insist on controlling women and their reproductive capacity. Of course, we all know that tRump ---whose rampant womanizing caused him to say that escaping VD was his ""personal Viet Namn"" --couldn't care less about abortion.

"Regrettably, the author does not define ""diversity in culture.""  That is far too often interpreted as hiring visible minorities and women as ""diversity"" and hence a bean counting exercise.  Such practices reinforce the status quo once hiring quotas are met, and ""diversity"" hires are often paraded around like show ponies on display.  It's sad, but those in the know truly 'get' the game being played, and participate compliantly in the pacification.

A true 'diverse' workforce comes from diversity in thought.  Diverse thinking can come from any brain, not just the brains of visible minorities and females."
"Americans better wake and now.

I checked on this. #3 Heidi Cruz works Goldman Sachs/Citibank she is a manager for them in the Southwest Region of Texas, She got millions from them for Ted on a signature loan. This was never filed with the Federal Election Commission. They did this hoping Ted will be President to protect people like Robert Mercer owes 10 Billion in taxes, at least 20 more just like Mercer. They gave Ted $100 Million. #4 Penelope Cruz' sister killed her self involved in drug sales etc. #5 Deborah Palfrey Washington D C madam phone records show Cruz contact, now she 
is found murdered .  Phil North Ted Cruz Pastor wants all gay people killed.#6 His Dad fought with and for Fidel Castro Army . Rafael Bienvenid Cruz."
Those women's stories were debunked.  How could I feel guilty about not voting for criminal Hillary Clinton?  Go Trump!
"Thank you - I'd like to answer.  Islam (Shariah) uses a calendar while everyone else uses a watch.

Shariah is an ideology that's stepping into the legal courts systems as a form of government. Oppressive by design, other governments are finding it non compatible with human rights.  Shariah is building the caliphate by a well-designed  7 phase plan spread out over 10 years.  First, bring people, then seep into  educational, judicial, and political systems, and openly declare discrimination, to bring public ire to unknowingly build support by a society who believes in helping and giving.  I am impressed by those who are using Islam to overtake - they are admirably smart. 

Recognizing that many societies are vulnerable because of beliefs, it becomes psychologically easy to sway them. i.e. start by shifting social norms - accept the headscarf as a sign of femininity - instead of the true oppression for which it's widely known.

"It was my clear observation that all the hate came from the right, and was aimed primarily at Obama, his wife and children, but also at Nancy Pelosi.

"I know it is not up to me, I am sorry if I offended anyone with that comment.  I struggle hearing so many people wanting to do very unChrist-like actions towards others who are evil as if it's okay; I just want everyone who believes in Jesus to remember His commandment before condoning any format of inhumane treatment towards another human regardless of how evil the person may be.
Also, I know Ms. Peterson didn't proclaim anything in the name of Christianity, so I apologize to her if anyone thought I was calling her unChristian because of my response, not the intention."

"Every religion (and ideology) has its various interpretations, from the stricter fundamentalists to the more liberal.

What interpretation someone chooses to accept tells you more about the person, than the religion. Every religion or ideology has its ayatollahs, its Grand Inquisitors, its Ideological Purists who make it their business to make sure everyone follows the strictest interpretation, and those who are more  easygoing, humane, accepting of human nature, etc.

That's why you can SEE the differences between the versions, between the Iranian Ayatollahs and the women who spy on their neighbours, gossiping about who is following the rules and who  isn't, and the ones trying to ""cheat"", etc.

So there are the ones attracted to the violent verses of a religion, and those who ignore them, or interpret them in a more figurative way.

What is scary is that we can't seem to be able to tell the difference."

"What I meant by ""run of the mill woman"" was the majority of women who do not live in fear of being raped or have been raped.  

The case of rape is an extreme case.  Even if I could grant that abortion is morally justifiable in cases of rape,  we do not form the rule by the exception.  For whatever reason liberals constantly seek to form rules by the exceptions.  They bring up some extreme case and say ""There. The fact that women might get raped and get pregnant entails abortion on demand. It also entails we must force Catholic hospitals to conform to our secular, liberal, atheistic, humanist ideology.""

No, it does not."
"Mother Jones lists 68 mass shootings since 1965 in gun free zones over 1,100 killed and wounded

Review of 33 incidents in gun free zones where armed self defense occured show only 82 killed and wounded

That means that the body count is 7 times higher in gun free zones where no armed self defense occurred

Now since concealed carry is no different than open carry, and has been legal in schools in 19 states and over 300 school districts for over 30 years with over 68 billion hours of students being exposed to 5% of teachers who like the population carry, surely you can post thousands of accidents, no, hundreds maybe, no.....why is that.."

"My late godmother used to say, ""Each to his own, 'said the old woman, as she kissed the cow."" That pretty much sums up my feelings about Pentecostals and anyone else who likes to wear their religious fervor on their sleeve. It's fine for them, it's just not my style. The kind of religious fervor charismatics like to display may work well in small groups, particularly in home settings, but don't necessarily translate well with large diverse groups of people in large buildings, as is often the case in Catholic worship. Only when like-minded people gather does that form of emotive worship work, IMHO. When people don't know each other well it's considered polite to exercise emotional restraint - that's just normal intuitive human behavior. I don't see worship as being any different in that respect. When it comes to worship I prefer a little more formality. My old teacher, Aidan Kavanagh, said it best, ""You should do liturgy like you drink your scotch - straight up!"" I always liked that."

""If guns were not so readily available this person wouldn't have had one."" So many leaps of logic it's hard to know where to begin. The main point, I think, is that there are hundreds of millions of firearms in the US, and repealing the Second Amendment ensures that law abiding citizens can't defend themselves against people who don't care either way about the Second Amendment. 

Fortunately it's a moot conversation. It'll never be repealed. Utopia is a paradox, join the rest of us in reality would you?"
"I truly feel that the penality is just not right. I am a 43 year old female. With permanent un-curable health problems or diseases as medically called. Doctors just monitor and help with treatments from meds or surgery as i live life. I have had these medical health diseases since 15. Now i work a full time job. But dont make anymore than any other standard blue collared struggling worker out there. Always just enough to pay rent, lights, food, car insurance and repairs and gas. I live very simple no expensive new electronics or cell phones. I watch every penny. Put back what i can for the winter heat bills. An NEVER BUY what i truly dont need for daily living. Yes i would love to have my medical coverage back!! But when it ended up tripled for my monthly premium. I could no longer afford it!! I searched for a new cheaper plan. But couldnt find one that i could afford. Or one that would cover my more important health needs!! So i just had to sacrifice coverage. to eat and have a roof."

Instead, there is the highly inaccurate statement of ""only 0.3 per cent of Canada’s international assistance (or $1.7-million) in 2013 actually reached women"".   The para is talking about funding to women's organizations, not women.  It also relies on how projects are coded, which is problematic.

The purported culture shift is a bit insulting to all the people at Global Affairs who have worked on gender/women's issues over the years.  I don't think you could find a single person there who sees women as passive beneficiaries and not powerful partners for change.  But that doesn't mean they all support having this new policy rammed down their throats.

"I think we have to be honest when attempting to ascribe attitudes to the historical Jesus. The word ""xenos"" in Matthew 25:35 means ""stranger,"" as Sister correctly translates. Jesus' own attitude toward foreigners, however, appears to have been more complex (cf. the encounter with the Syro-Phoenician woman in  Mark 7: ""It is not right to take the food of the children and throw it to the dogs"" and the encounter with the Samaritan woman in John 4). 
I think we have to accept the fact that we feel called to extend hospitality to foreigners by many values we hold dear as Christians and as Americans, but recourse to the historical Jesus is not as helpful as we might like it to be."

They're not scared or weak, they exalt the scared and weak to tear down the strong. They don't want to lift up the weak, they want to kick down the strong.  Everything these activists (BLM, Feminists, SJWs) say is the opposite of what they mean. Safe spaces doesn't mean safety. its means this is an aggressively hostile space for the out-group. Person X is being oppressive/non-inclusive is a signal to attack person X. They have to appear to be the victim, that is their strength, without it they have nothing to stand on, when really, they are just bullies going after soft targets and victim rhetoric is their weapon."

"Francie: You need to do a little research on the struggle for women's suffrage. (OK, a lot of research). Those ladies were hell-raisers, especially in Britain. 

In the US, one of them, Alice Paul, organized demonstrations outside the White House in 1917. This culminated in the “Night of Terror” during which guards at Virginia’s Occoquan Workhouse brutally beat some 30 female picketers. At the time, Paul was serving a seven-month stint in prison, where she was force-fed and confined to a psychopathic ward. Others were tried and convicted of voter fraud. It was very messy.

"Again, read the Didache.  Abortion was always considered a moral evil.  It was specifically condemned by Clement of Alexandria, St. Basil and others.  The main topic of debate, until modern science, was when ensoulment occured.  But that's a theological debate, not based on science.  Having no knowledge of DNA, or embryology, people have always debated abortion.  Gastrulation is a phase early in the embryonic development of most animals during which the single-layered blastula is reorganized into a trilaminar (three-layered) structure known as the gastrula. The term was invented in 1872.  Gastrulation occurs around day 15 following conception, well before a woman will know she's pregnant.  So you don't believe in abortion then?
There is no scientific basis for the notion that the ""mother's DNA guides development until gastrulation.""  It doesn't occur in an ovum for example.  The DNA from both parents is utilized at all stages of existence.  Science says human life begins at conception."

For example, when he proclaims his reverence for women, he does so in terms of relative reverence: ""No one respect's women more than I do"".  As a narcissist, he thinks that the value of one's intent is how it ranks among others. He could say: ""I think  as a culture there are many areas where we can all show more respect for women.""
He did this with the Jews too: “I am the least anti-Semitic person that you’ve ever seen in your entire life.”"

"The facility was founded by Queen Kapiʻolani as the Kapiʻolani Maternity Home in 1890 for which she held bazaars and luaus to raise $8,000 needed to start the Home. It has since changed its name several times. Kauikeolani Children’s Hospital opened in 1909 named for Emma Kauikeolani Napoleon Mahelona (1862–1931), the wife of Albert Spencer Wilcox (1844–1919).[1] In 1978, it merged with Kapiʻolani Hospital to become Kapiʻolani Medical Center for Women and Children in 1978 I think."
"why are people, especially women, so obsessed with what others think of you or what others are doing.  for Christ`s sake just do what YOU think is right and ignore the idiots."
"Feminism is capitalism. It is a way to capitalism women by repression their sexuality. They are told not get married, not to have children, not have sex, have sex, have certain kind of sex, wait to get married etc. etc.
-
Women are being turned into objects of production, they are being enslaved and sold out. It will not last, feminism is just a fad, women will return to being women because it is their biology. Capitalism goal is more capitalism, women need to ask themselves how that serves them."
"""The disaster we chose""?  No, the disaster you chose, MSW, was Hillary Clinton.

You supported a common crook and an abortion advocate, a woman who sold political influence netting her over 100 million dollars, a woman who lied over and over again, a woman who has no accomplishments whatsoever.

That's who you tried to sell us, MSW, that's your disaster.  

America said NO.  

And you can't even go a day without beginning the complaints and the accusations, oh, in the name of reason and peace.

Go walk your dogs on the way to pick up your paycheck, profCath."
"Trump must be one of them liars Amylou speaks of since today he actually said, ""Clinton WANTS to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country"".

Here is his entire ""speech"". There are so many falsehoods and outright lies in this trash talk, one would have an easier time finding water in the Atacama Desert than they would find any facts in this dribble.

She ""WANTS "", really? I mean really?  No, really? Are you sure DT? What makes you so sure? I mean seriously, really?  No Donald, you want the uneducated voter to simply FOLLOW every FALSE word you utter. This is outright DISGUSTING, SICK and PERVERTED.

I've seen and heard tRump say a lot of stupid things, but this has got to be right up there in the top 10."

"One consideration in BC is whether you worked on the Employer's Premises or not.

My wife had an IT support contract where they told her to come in to the office to monitor the monthly billing runs, and for to bill time for a goofy team building session. Korkin Commission happened, and she was told not to bother coming in any more for those, to make her a bona fide contractor. 

Several Indendent Contractors I worked with were told to take their Korbin Employee offers or be terminated. They all said No Thanks. Years later they were still there but subcontacting through IBM Global as part of IBM's BC Subcontracting Quota."
"It would be nice to have the option of  ""Stand up for women who are being discriminated against."""
"Sorry, but your comment is garbage.  Our daughter teaches at a major US university.  She was up for tenure this year.  She made it through both her faculty panel and the university panel without a single dissenting vote.  So, your point is?"
"Its amazing what yo can get away with,  with Justin and his Liberals,  if you have brown skin or are a woman."
"""Hillary Clinton is a woman of many strengths and virtues, but like all of us, she also has some blind spots,"" Gergen said in a recent interview. ""She does not see the world in the same way that others do, when it comes to transparency and accountability.""""

Virtues? What a load of manure!"
"From what I've been reading about what these women have been saying, these are not ""vague"" memories at all.  To the contrary, many of them are saying that the events were so traumatic that they are still very vivid memories, even if they had happened years before.

Also, how is the quote you provided meaningful in any way to this conversation?  Essentially it says ""this is how it is meant to be; be at peace with it and move on"".  That is the sentiment that these predators have always relied upon from their victims....this is how things are, keep silent, and move on."

"John Marque Javelet has a supporter, too. Some 15 year old girl is claiming to be his girlfriend and he's been wrongly accused of murder. Sometimes public agencies just go around making shlt up about the nicest people...."
Odd comment from a bubble girl.  Some folks would call this projection. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection
"After GW Bush's disastrous invasion of Iraq, followed by Obama's equally disastrous premature withdrawal and disengagement, how exactly is Trump going to do worse?

Trump dodged the Vietnam war and has shown no appetite for foreign adventures. I'm not a Trump fan by any stretch, but all this talk of 'danger' strikes me as hyperbole. The Democrats' war room seems to agree with me, or else they would focus on this danger rather than his taxes, demeaning of women and other tripe."
"LOVE the fact that Texas, the land of Backwardtardedness, is actually using what WAS, in that whole Lochner Court period, a reasonably 'decent' attempt by the Court TO protect workers - and turning it into a medieval doctrine. Yes, yes, it did treat women as 'weak' things who's one and only 'real' function was to bring forth children - but in the history of US Constitutional Law (which I teach) Muller v Oregon 208 U.S. 412 was considered a 'ray of sunshine' in what was a seemingly bottomless pit of business interest jurisprudence. Leave it to Texas - past masters at warping an already warped Rabid Right ideology."
"This may be an interesting case to prosecute - the women came willingly, and even after being told what would happen, voluntarily removed their clothes and allowed the activity.  For money. No indication of force or coercion, or that either was stopped from leaving.  Unless there is much being omitted, is this actually sexual assault when the women volunteereed for and consented to, the contact? 

He came from Iran as a child decades ago, so I think this is just plain ordinary perversion that doesn't depend on his ""culture"".  Fraud, most likely, but I don't think any ""culture"" other than a sick fantasy life is to blame."
"You words are so vile, and your long list of personal slurs against this woman does nothing to defend your stance of Fascism and attacking the free speech of others.  What's more- your specious belief that Berkley Administrators are somehow victims who must deal with their ""angst"" is laughable: they have created this environment of Leftist intolerance and bigotry, and the are paying the price.  They will lose their current laundry list of lawsuits for this reason- and they will lose big.  I cannot wait to see these Leftist students and their Leftist faculty wither and writhe at the thought of other points of view being thrust down their entitled little necks."
"Acquit her, then commit her. This womens cheese has slid so far off the cracker she's a danger to herself and to others.

"The Globe is being disingenuous, but why? Globe editorial writers know enough history to be able to put this in a long line of minor issues that become major electoral fodder.

They could start with the ""Yvette incident"" in the 1980 Quebec referendum, and go all the way to Clinton's ""basket of deplorables"" comment in the last US election.

Here's the Globe's 1980 take on the Yvette incident:

""But two weeks later, an unexpected incident changed the nature of the campaign. Lise Payette, the minister responsible for the Feminine Condition, in an unguarded moment referred to Mrs. Ryan as an ""Yvette,"" the docile little girl in a widely used grade-school primer.

""That provoked a massive backlash among housewives, and a week later more than 14,000 chanting women filled the Montreal Forum. The polls would later show that 10 per cent of Quebec women changed their vote intentions."""

"mike,  I know you just started with this information but I have to comment that you only gave info on 3 things that can be used in a disaster situation.  you are NOT prepared for a disaster,  as I can see.   not to deter you,  please continue and hope we don't have a disaster before you get all your info out

the past 2008 when power went out for a day,  the next few days I went to Longs and bought the radio there at the advice of the filipino women working at the counter.  still have it.  Costco has their 8 D battery lantern,  no review on youtube on the latest."
"Look at the People who cyber bullied her to begin with LOL One woman actually had to show a dog instead of her own picture just because of way she looks no doubt!  Elaine hey bow - wow.

"One of the missing crew members was a friend I have known for about 18 years. I won't mention his name here because it hasn't been publicly released yet. He has a family who is hurting deeply at this time. He leaves behind a young daughter who will struggle to find peace with this. If the sea would give up his earthly body so that closure could at least be attempted, that would be great. If not, we are just praying that he's where he wanted to be. Keep the two sets of families in mind as you go about the business of living. There is great sadness and loss."
"I think at issue is that she might have been cooking and had the 12yr old keeping an eye on it while she ran out real quick; but i have no idea what this girls experience with cooking would be, and that's a shame because a single box of baking soda and what to do with it,  could have made the difference here."
"I doubt it very much, given that you see your wife as a sex object."
I'm very sorry for your wife and you.
Acquittal does not mean he did not do the things he was charged of.  He admitted what he did to CBC lawyers and that is why he was fired.  The trial was a different situation altogether with a Judge who basically didn't like the woman and pretty much said so in his ruling.  He hit and choked woman during sex without their consent.  The guy is a creep
"I think the criminal conviction becomes challenging because modern justice still utilizes archaic and ignorant views on how a person should/will/does behave during, and after, sexual assaults.  Until the legal system gets more educated about the broad spectrum of a victim's behavior these things will continue to go unpunished.....sadly.

Kudos to the courage of the woman for coming forth and reporting the incident!"
"Pandora, as usual, you missed my point entirely.  I keep getting asked by rightwing trolls when I am leaving the Catholic Church because I disagree with its current teaching on the ordination of women.  That is, of course, an absurd question.  I was also repeatedly told to leave the country when I vocally opposed George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq to seize weapons of mass destruction that didn't exist.

I was just holding the mirror up to the trolls."
"Yes.  It just doesn't get more hypocritical when the so called ""pro-life, pro-family"" party dumps maternity coverage for poor women. They obviously don't give a hoot about babies, it's all about how they can squeeze more tax breaks for billionaires."
"What NPS has not studied but Gordon did, which we have witnessed repeatedly here in Denali is how these impacts perpetuate in groups that stay together long after the trapping/shooting deaths occurred. 

In 2005, in East Fork’s case (historically, the primary family group of wolves viewed by visitors - before Grant Creek), it fundamentally changed their territory, hunting denning habits, and significantly reduced their use of the road corridor to the point where they were seldom viewed up until the last one was killed and/or dispersed in 2016. 

The same thing occurred in 1995 with the last pregnant female of the Headquarters (which utilized the pavement section of the park) being trapped out reducing wolf viewing for years. 

This happened again most recently in 2012 with Coke Wallace again killing the alpha female and primary attendant female of Grant Creek destroying the best wolf viewing in Alaska and perhaps anywhere. 

Final segment to be continued:"
"American Heritage Girls is a far right evangelical group that only permits girls to be in traditional roles.  If you go to the website, you will find the material geared toward molding girls into subservient helpmeets and broodmares.  It centers on homemaking skills.  In contrast, GSA is about molding the future leaders of tomorrow, not the future submissive homemakers."
The refusal to ordain women is not about service at all. It is about ego and desire.
Since when was Coleman a feminist? I am asking YOU.
So glad we have Joseph to lecture us on what women think.
"So, the way for rich idle westerners to observe this ""day of the girl"" is to goof off more than usual on social media?  A fat lot of good that will do any real girl in Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, or Venezuela."
"Exactly right!

Kiz knows nothing about football and makes a living just spewing out drivel to excite the masses. I don't know why I always subject myself to his lame articles. It is like not looking away from a train wreck. 

He isn't even consistent in his controversy. He says one thing, then the opposite, and then after the fact, he reminds everyone how he was correct by citing the opposite article. 

Why can't Kiz start reporting on Women's fashion and give us sports fans a break? He knows about as much about Women's fashion as football, and he can create just as much controversy there."
"Well then, in that case, women win hands down."
"You sound like Trump..... ""no one respects women more than I do.""  In fact, based on Trump's behaviors and based on your history of comments on this site, if ""no one respects women more than you two do"", women are in serious trouble.  Regards, Gary Crum"
"More gender bs from the Liberals.  As a woman, I am pretty sure earning the position is much more empowering than being pushed to the front because of my gender.    Do these Liberals think women are not capable of doing it on their own?"
"Exactly, LOL. But libs bought it and to them Weinstein the sleazebag is a saint. Figures. Where did they leave their feminism?"
"Another G&M episode of sexist ( whatever )  .... The plot is getting rather stale and moldy by now.

I spent many years in high tech industry ( R&D ) and management. The annual ( professional ) staff performance and salary reviews  were agreed between the relevant management groups given the budget and noteworthy performance criteria. We did have a percentage of female scientific staff to PhD level. At no time was there any discrimination against the ladies of our division - and I categorically reject the credibility of the minister's anecdotal histrionics !

Engaged in extensive industry contacts related to busines and again a percentage of women professionals - they were treated with respect, period ! To do otherwise would have been unthinkable in my experience.  It is in the nature of the beast that women tend to decline the more intensive career paths for family reasons .... and I for one think it is entirely unfair to them to expect otherwise. Feminist propaganda to the contrary !"
"The UBC letter referred by Mr. Kinew to was a perfectly reasonable request for due process, signed by many other well known writers, including no less than feminist luminary Margaret Atwood. Mr. Kinew also has to know that rescinding due process in sexual misconduct and sexual assault cases will tend to have a disproportionate negative impact on Native defendants."
"I like old Sheriff Joe, I like him a lot, I'm glad President Trump pardoned him it was the right thing to do. But the old Buck is 85, I think it's time he starts sitting on his front porch with a lemonade or a cold beer and watch whatever sunsets he's got left. I understand there is a very nice woman, Mrs. Ward, Kelly Ward who is about 30 pts ahead of Flake in the polls. So take it easy Joe and thanks for all your good work, ""well done good and faithful servant""."
"When you go into a government office to do business, you're required to remove ski masks and halloween masks to identify yourself.  What's so special about the niqab and burka that some women will not remove them in a government office?"
"And you probably support paying for women contraceptives though you health care premium. 

I do agree, you something, you pay for it."
"Beth, you assume writer is a Republican.  Democrats have a habit of  taking assumptions as truths and this is what starts the making of ""fake news ""!
If anything, you should publicly request your party of choice (Democrats), to refrain from twisting and turning comments to their use. I will never forget how you called out President Trump ""foul"" language and not wanting your niece exposed to this and yet you marched in the so called ""Women's March "" in a sea of foul language. I'm a woman and I am a woman of independence thanks to my parents, education and experiences. I don't you or a bunch of protesters to speak for me."
"I don't need to know her, and her ""true"" intent was made when she felt it was a good idea to mock an entire race of people for kicks.  I bet she was the belle of the ball with her other friends that likely let her win the costume contest.  My reaction to racism is not part of the problem in the least - the problem is racism, subtle or blatant.  My inability to forgive racist behavior comes from so many ""self-serving"" obligatory apologies, saying she didn't mean to offend anyone and was just (fill in stupid and silly excuse for racism here).  As for judge and jury, her employer is the one threatening her livelihood, not me.  Your anger and ire should be directed toward them, not to an American that finds her behavior offensive.  I bet people like you made excuses for slavery, Jim Crow and still mock Black Lives Matter for wanting police to stop killing them a such an alarming rate.   Spare me your fake outrage at my reaction and not outrage to the racist actions Ray."
"I've given you a hard time about your attitude toward women, but I think, if one removes gender, that you are mostly right about the roots of conflict,    It would apply to Any two people as well.   (For that matter any two teams , organizations, dare we say nations?)

I'd also add that equity of power also making a huge difference in the relationship dynamic, equal or unequal.   If one uses power to intimidate and frighten the other person, they alone are the one escalating the violence.     

No two fights have the same story.   You are correct, we should not make assumptions about the nature of the relationship, no matter the gender,

Honestly I think most all of these conflicts end up in court, which, while not perfect, at least provides a forum for both sides.   We writers aren't much more than the rabble with signs outside the courthouse that never hear testimony   :-)"
exactly...no one is helping her by encouraging lawless behavior..and not owing up to the consequences of your own behavior..or making excuses for sin.....the problem is a lot of people dont understand the word sin anymore..they think everything goes..and its all love love love..and no trust and obey...as scripture teaches...Christ and scripture never taught us to defy authority or have dis respect for another country that is not ours..or to be a victim and think we deserve special treatment when we clearly broke a reasonable law that she could have easily gotten here a long time ago and been a citizen by now had she not wilfully re entered the country after being stopped in the airport..i have no sympathy and i dont understand church people who are enabling this. its not wonder we have an overlflow of lawless entitled youth and millennial in our country if their parents..pastors and church fold are teaching them they dont really have to obey the law and make excuses for wrong doing.
"Building hotels outside of the US isn't presidential, it's business and running this country takes more than making money and flipping the bird at women, veterans, people of color, and people with disabilities.

""I also agree Obama’s record of disasters speaks for itself."" Here is a prime example of your lying. I never wrote/agreed to that but you post it as if I did.
You expect people to respect your opinions but when you openly lie your credibility and the respect of others disappears."
"""This evil scandal rolls on with no end in sight. ""

Did you mean the evil scandal that is referred to in the INSERM Report (National Institute of Health and Medical Research), published in France in 2006, as 10% of women stating that they were victims of sexual assault before the age of 18? Or did you have in mind as an evil scandal that there are no major investigative reports about this, nor international uproar?"
Check this out I am the woman that was held hostage and my 2 year old daughter and I were alone when he got there he started throwing up at some point and I then texted my friend without his knowledge that I needed help then turned my phone off then I waited for my friend to come help when he arrived he forced my friend inside at gun point then my friend attacked him because he slapped me and when he did that I pushed my daughter to safety and then helped my friend in fighting the Asshole that bombarded my home. Any other stupid as S questions or comments can go directly back up to where they came from....ur Asshole cuz it's none of ur business nor was it the media's business to be putting our lives out there for idiots Like u for entertainment
"Yes, seeing each other's face is part of communications, but it's not compulsory, nor should it be. Like most things in our society, it's a matter of freedom of choice. We manage to communicate just fine sitting beside each other,  or in the dark. This compulsory 'must see the other person's face' thing is sheer bullshit, and an excuse for bigots and misogynists to support the oppression of a small group of Muslim women."
"Most wearers are either converts, or young women convinced by radical imams that is what Allah wants, not old but recent immigrants having trouble adapting."
"I have no problem with you making the assumption that your lawn is wet because it rained, but it doesn't necessarily follow that the troopers should assume that the woman died as a result of injuries from the collision just because she was in a car that had been in a collision."
"I get the feeling that these women they quoted say ""oh no, oh no, oh noooo""  an awful lot.   These ""refuges"" were in safety in other areas of Russia and are now in complete safety in Canada.  What more do they want from us?  
Canadians with mental health issues are living on the streets and they don't get this much help.
Let's get our priorities straight already.  Enough of this heartstring reaction B.S.
Let's fix our own house first for a change."
"I heard the radio broadcast of Lamberg and Fahey during their Q & A at the City Club of Eugene. Lambert seemed like a nice enough person who was afraid to answer simple questions with her actual views.

Asked about a woman's right to choose, she responded that women should have the right to choose adoption; and that was as much sunlight on her real views as she allowed. Asked if she favored right to work legislation, or supported unions, she said that business should be unleashed to provide workers more benefits. Her answer was so inarticulate that it wasn't clear if she even understood ""right to work,"" which is actually a hot-button issue for Republicans.

Eugene having a liberal reputation, it seemed that she felt that she must not say what she thinks.

Julie Fahey was a marked contrast: well informed on a great variety of issues, an excellent speaker willing and able to articulate her thought-out approaches to today's complex problems."
"Yes they do do keep people in jail on misdemeanors, jay walking, spent 37 days in jail then charges were dropped.  I had to bail myself out.
There is no mental health services in jail, other than to admit an inmate is mentally ill."
"I'm going to stop reading the news online. I get sick to my stomach . Just think , these are only the monsters who have been caught. What about the others? Also where were the parents/guardians of these girls???"
She is not the first woman nominated by a major party. That honor goes to Shirley Chisum but the media doesn't bother to do their homework.
Trump has already motivated more women to get outside and exercise than the Wookie did in eight years.
"Has anyone else wondered why this is still a top story after nearly-2 weeks?  Why would anyone care what these folks think?  If people want to be dumb, I usually just let them.  But we've gotten to a place in this country where, if someone disagrees with us, we have to brow-beat them into submission.  Whatever people believe does not change the facts.  Why are people still commenting on the substance of this issue?"
It's why feminism is so heavily reliant on class based approaches to... everything. Intersectional feminism is just feminism with sub-classes.
"I don't want to comment on the credibility or non-credibility of these women themselves. But just basing my observation on tRump's recorded comments alone, where he admits to committing actions that are considered assault by today's definitions, the question should be more along the line of: tRump, if these accusers are lying, then which women DID you assault by forcing your disgusting lips on them without their consent?"
She might be thankful that she was stopped from falling in with that  nest of vipers.
What the heck ?  Only one woman could make the grade ?  So much for equality .
"Columns like this are such an easy shot, another chance for the online anonymous to smugly scold the rich and famous, to be witty, as if those rich and famous would care or even know. There's no shortage of ""vacuous"" in this juvenile culture, what else is new. 
Though her daddy is now way in over his orange head, I'm guessing that Ivanka Trump likes her life -- much as Justin Trudeau likes his, unbothered by all the cheap shots from the usual rednecks -- and neither of them would trade places with a mere observer, distant and irrelevant, left only to bleat from the sideline."
"That is not a given.  If there are those opposed to war because people are killed, despite your belief they don't have the right to refuse to not support this form of killing, because you don't deem it important enough does not mean your opinion should be law.  If you want wars to be how we secure our country and its government and you want people to pay for that choice and the majority of voters agrees, then you have to pay when the majority of voters demands that birth control be allowed to women because many need it medically or for other reasons.  Democracy is about supporting the majority voice not just your conservative voice."
"Right, there is something wrong with this picture, you are attempting to defend Taliban cowards. Women and children were given an opportunity to leave the bomb-making compound, Khadr stayed behind, go figure. The US soldiers saved Khadr's life, this payment is a mark of national shame."
So......all the best to its first female leader.....may she go far.......time to pay a visit?.......she has invited us.
"She is a minority in the sense that no one else would have been so downright  uncaring about the lives that were set in turmoil and pardoned a person while others who have committed like crimes are doing time. Both the wife and the ADA are sick women, one to do the deed and the other to condone it."
"This case is a tough one for the politically correct. An illegal immigrant beats a helpless 17 year old Muslim girl in traditional dress to death with a baseball bat. Police declare it to be ""road rage"" despite the fact that only one car was involved. I suspect there are some large pieces of this horrible incident that have yet to be revealed."
"What a push for socilasim by the would be dictator. That was truly a dark, scary, forewarning of things to come. She didn't promise freedom... She promised enslavement for all. But I could be wrong, she has been known to lie since Bill's governor days. She is not for women... This is one power hungry individual. Dark days lay ahead"
"I can easily understand how Monsef's mother could make mistakes on her application form.

What I don't understand is how Monsef could construct an entire fake narrative, base a political career on it, be vetted for Cabinet, and no-one raised a peep of problem before now."
"I am sure if native witnesses were offered $10,000 cash for their testimony, the inquiry would still be on track and full steam ahead. For $25,000, they could even find more missing women they forgot to mention. ."
"Well, if you ask me, just look at all the Liberal news outlets. The women on there are all dyky looking. Short hair and no style in clothes. I’ve always said they look ugly because of the scowl on their faces. Hate will do that to you! Lol."
Fricken' brilliant!  You go girl!
"It gave Ivanka a chance to try to regain public affirmation (and we all know who Donald's favourite girl is!).
It was a brilliant stroke."
"Meant to mention about 2 months ago in DP was a story about a women with 3 u.s. born children.
She was ordered to leave, instead stayed and had 3 children. ICE caught up with her and she is now living south of the border without the children. Sad but she new the rules.
I don't expect the DP to do an updated if she somehow got back in."
"Commissioner Johnson has been a great leader for her district and county.  Her key points are true - the County's economy is driven by the Navy (88% to be exact per WA state study).  That effectively means that all key services, like Island Transit which is funded through sales tax, is driven largely by Navy payroll - same goes for education, retail, car repair, housing values...

The 1991 BRAC listing was a result of  a few negative comments from a couple local politicians and a rabid campaign from WISE.  DC listens to this."
billary is the correct name for someone faking a marriage to bill just to try and be important and have a failed campaign. the name shall stand.
But she is a woman and qualified doesn't matter as long as you have at least  50% of your cabinet made up of women.
"Kurgan, I was remembering that poster as claiming to be female, in a post several months ago.  Is this a gender-confusion issue?  Well, ""catholic"" includes everybody...."
Always hold your kids. My daughter almost ran over from a backing up truck at Costco the first day in Hawaii. So sorry.
"As awful as this incident is, it sounds like these two adults are in over their heads trying to raise nine children with 40+ dogs and cows and who knows what else on their property. So sad, but they should have had safety plans to make sure in emergencies they had the resources to quickly evacuate all their animals, not just the female dogs that make them money."
"I hate that so, so much. Who goes around with a grin plastered to their face all the time? Why is it expected of women? It reminds me of The Stepford Wives."
"Some Anglicans have been meeting together for decades with some Orthodox.

Ditto some Anglicans and Old Catholics, some Anglicans and Catholics, some Anglicans and Lutherans.

Of those groups, the only concrete results have been intercommunion with the Old Catholics - who are a tiny sect - and some Lutherans.

The Orthodox women deacons are what Latin Rite Catholics call sisters - they are not in orders.

The rank and file don't have a say in whether women are ordained in Orthodoxy. Outside North America and some small support in Western Europe, it is a non-issue."
is it the same for gay prostitutes?
"As opposed to the Democratic Party, which is run by flim-flam women and fairies ?"
"She looks so stupid and hideous always wearing those idiotic cowboy hats. They make her appear uglier than she already is. She is sleazebag moron who needs to shut up her hateful, disdgusting, nasty mouth!!!!!!!!!!!!! I hate her!  She is pure evil😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈😈"
"Well of course I will be judged on my choices.  If I am wrong, I will answer for it, and humbly accept the consequences before God.  As we all must do.

If the hierarchy really believes God Wills No Woman, then open the door and teach, train, and test.  It should soon become evident if XX stumbles over the sill more than XY."
"If we can agree that population growth is a good thing -- I am not always so sure due to the environmental impact -- then we would do well to encourage those already here to have more children.  Quebec's social programs for families are the nation's most generous, and it should come as no surprise that they also have the highest birth rates.  I disagree with Ibbitson's statement that ""trying to bribe a woman to have a third child in the national interest is offensive.""  Many young families I know would love to have more children -- but day care and housing costs are prohibitive.  A helping hand would be welcome; those women uninterested in the opportunity are certainly not compelled to take it."
"Total BS. Monica Lewinsky was never ""assaulted"" in the White House. She was an adult woman involved in a consensual affair with Bill Clinton. It's obvious from her public statements that Lewinsky was in love with the president, and, to her credit, defended Clinton even under pressure from the most virulent public scrutiny.

Quit lying in the promotion of your alt-right politics."
"Because Nazis are so pro-immigration, pro-Islam, feminist and all for equal rights? He has a fairly viral YouTube video ranting about Jews and Israel- I'm sure the Nazis /hate/ it and totally disagree."
"Usually, I make just one comment on a story.  Not this time.  This'll be #2 on this follow-up on rape investigation.

 Headline says ""police unite"" and story says, ""police services across the country announce reviews..."" I may have missed the list.  Anybody see one? Only two forces are named specifically: Ottawa and the RCMP, although, supposedly, they ""became the latest forces to commit to reviewing sexual-assault cases.""  Yeah, a small thing--but sloppy journalism, raising the question (at least in my mind) what ELSE is sloppy on this beat?

""Me-too"" political correctness runs rampant. Understandably, the RCMP is pretty sensitive about women issues. But judging from G&M's own statistics, in one jurisdiction at least, RCMP performs well: Sidney BC contracts RCMP services.  The Town has the 5th LOWEST ""unfounded"" rate in the country (5%)! Nevertheless, the Scarlet Force seizes the opportunity to look good.  

Just like the PM.  And people accuse O'Leary of being opportunistic..."
"I don't believe most, if not all, people are abortion PROPONENTS. Rather, I think pro-CHOICE people recognize some women feel they have no other choice, especially in light of the stinginess of Congress--and getting stingier."
"If she decided to go into politics, I'm sure a lot of people would vote for her just because of her looks."
"Elise, when it comes to the Chamber's (and Senate's) so called strategy, the analogy I keep thinking of is that you have a retail business.  Walmart has moved in next door and is selling the same products at half your price.  So you respond by not advertising, laying off all of your workers, paying your bills with your credit card, and count on doubling your prices next year."
"Who knew the Globe was a staunch defender of the KKK's rights. After all, the KKK cloak represents religious purity, prejudice against homosexuals, anti-semitism - and so does the niqab, all over the world, without exception.  But the niqab means feminism and modesty in Canada (just Canada). I'm still waiting for the Globe's piece in the Life section with three Klansmen pushing their kids on swings in the park - they just wear the cloak for modesty and to represent their faith, nothing to do with support of violence towards homosexuals and Jews... does this sound ridiculous, because it is  - let's defend a symbol that is synonymous with violence against homosexuals - as the niqab is most common in countries that punish homosexuality with jail or worse (often the death penalty). But in Canada it means modesty and independence - the niqab's supporters are pathetic. Let's encourage a symbol that is only common in countries where women are treated like second class citizens..."
"But inquiring liberals want to know what colour were her socks?  The outrage!!!

Trudeau is known to wear stylish socks from skull and crossbones in Davos, Switzerland, argyle at APEC, and socks with maple leaf motifs at the First Ministers meeting in Ottawa-globeandmail

Oh my gosh.  I'm deflecting.  We're not here to talk about socks, were here to talk about decorum at important events.  No wait..I'm deflecting again.

We're to discuss this women behaving like Justin, no wait...darn.

We're here to discuss if Harper actually pocketed that communion wafer.

Aghhhh..so much trivial minutia to spew hate at....

Back to kneeling on the couch."
"Clinton is a proven liar on numerous occasions (Benghazi, emails, running from snipers, etc., ad infinitum), is psychopathic in her disregard for others, is petty, vindictive, amoral, and wholly incapable of genuine leadership as she must have someone to focus an attack (right wing conspiracy, deplorables, bimbo's, etc.).  She is no example for others as she cares for nobody but herself.  She may have those that admire her, but my guess is they are likely cut from the same cloth.  There is nothing good to say about this woman except  that she lost her 2nd Presidential election even after cheating to become the Democrat candidate.  Good riddance to her and her entire family, may they go away soon and become even less relevant."
The main reason that women do not succeed in the startup space is due to their backstabbing toxic femininity.
As a part of holding the party accountable will the Democrats finally STOP protecting Hillary and tell the truth about all her underhanded doings

"If those who disagree with Francis are ""hard-hearted Christians,"" does that mean that those who disagree with him about women are also hard-hearted? Or is it possible that our viewpoint has some merit Francis hasn't seen? And if that's true, at least in theory, does it mean that those who disagree on other issues may be equally sincere?"
"These women like many of us, cherished those adrenaline filled moments that mother nature provides for us. It is always a tragic loss and a time for reflection for each one of us when a life is lost doing something we love to do. It is a personal choice to head out into the ""wilderness"" and you have to make decisions based upon the current conditions. There is no textbook or instructor that can teach you everything you need to know to survive. It is the ""uncertainty of the unknown"" that keeps me outdoors. Rules and regulations cannot fix the problems. We do not need TVs to act as passifiers for the time between working and sleeping.  Age (generally) is not an accurate measurement of ability. I am 28 and have participated in several endurance races. I am in good shape, but am always been humbled when someone twice my age passes me during a leg of an event. Those people are some of the most inspirational people i have seen. I hope i can continue doing it at their pace when i get there!"
"Umm you are wrong. The statistics show that Alaska natives far out pace per capita any other culture in the USA as far as molesters, abusers, incest, wife beating,child beating, ect .

"Make more laws so it becomes impossible to do any business in the United States, this will pay off the $20 trillion dollar debt and fund the $80 billion entitlement programs like medicare! United States needs a leader that will make America great again! 

I read this story where a few young girls wanted to open a lemonade stand and one of little girl's father was an attorney and researched what it would take to start doing business selling the drinks. The cost for permitting, licenses and other regulatory cost was $8,000 and 7 month process just to sell Lemonade! 

So the little girls gave up on the lemonade business and  just borrowed the money they needed from their parents and never produced a produce or provided any services!

That's what the oil and gas companies can do borrow money and pay it off in bankruptcy a small price to pay for climate change as President Barack Obama and the EPA sees it.

Obama will leave the United States with more Debt then any president in  History."
"Wow, a female habitual criminal involved in a crime and no heart wrenching stories from the DP about how she was abused as a kid, or was a struggling single mother?

"Women can be appointed cardinals now - apparently it's not required that a cardinal be a priest. Sounds odd doesn't it? But there you are.
In fact, I believe that it would in theory be possible for a woman to be pope! All that is needed is to abolish the need for a pope to be Bishop of Rome. (The Avignon Popes weren't)."
So you're fine with having your pussy grabbed?
Well then maybe they shouldn't have LIED to their states and said they would repeal it. Two of these women are duplicitous and deceitful for voting for it last year and not now. Go explain that to YOUR states.
"Not at all. All protesters who practice civil disobedience should be prosecuted. They enter into it with the expectation that they'll be arrested and punished - that's the point. Any other view would be hypocrisy. 

Therefore, I assume you're against harassment of women at abortion clinics."
gross. i dont want to know that you are openly for sexual assault or that it took you awhile to respect women. i firmly stand against violence towards women and dont think you are staying on topic
No that's not what I'm saying. This article is about Republicans. I have no idea why any woman would vote for Trump unless they like being abused.
"Well this is a more reasonable direction at least. But this issue still has to do more with privacy than religion (at least for those of us that aren't xenophobes). Why should anyone have to reveal their face or any other body part to the government unless for the purpose of intial identification when receiving a public service ever? 
With cameras and facial recognition everywhere tracking everything we do for unknown/undisclosed purposes the niqab or any other face covering (balaclava, hat and sunglasses or camera scrambling shades) makes perfect sense. Are we eventually proposing to ban all of those while in public so the gov't and corporations can spy on us and build files on us? Why do we allow tinted windows when driving on public roads? I should be able to identify the person cutting me off in the left lane!
Women that wear the niqab honestly are interested in protecting their privacy as we all should be. 
Take off your veil of intolerance Quebec and see the true issue!"
fuck your mother.
Nice job lady Lynx.
"I have no reservations in opposing your attempts to control those who are addicted merely because you are offended by them and their habit.  Eugenics is precisely the same thing.  Those who intellectually 'knew best' and with the best of intentions ruined thousands of lives.  Margaret Sanger of Planned Parenthood and ""The Negro Project"", included.    She and W.E.B Dubois 'worried' that the Negroes would view it as genocide, but they proceeded anyway because keeping these women from getting pregnant was 'for their own good'.  Your tobacco plan is also 'for their own good' although it is also because you are offended.  Anytime I see someone coming towards me to do something  'for my own good', I will react with any 2nd Amendment tool I can find.  And I quit smoking in 2003; I'm defending the rights of others to be foolish, not myself."
"I once read a story about a firefighter who molested children, and another story that identified a woman who intentionally spread HIV to others, named Amy.  So if I wrote a slandering blog post based on this association and posted their address so we could combat their potential sexual crimes, I'd be in the right and wouldn't have to apologize?  Good to know"
Most unfortunate that this one woman felt she had the right to disregard everyone else's rights.
Let's have a hearing and listen to these women and the 30 witnesses to see if it's true.  Don't drag Joseph and Mary and Jesus into it.  They have a hard enough time rationalizing why God ever gave a damn about us.
And a woman as the Apostle to the apostles.
"Your bishop, like every other bishop, cannot go too far in discussing in public what is currently forbidden by the Church magisterium.  It is a very difficult position they are in.  For example, the study group formed by Pope Francis re: women deacons, hasn't issued a single word yet of their deliberations.  It includes some very well known - and very vocal - advocates of ordaining women as deacons (i.e. Phyllis Zagano) and I have no idea how their work is progressing.  But the issue is undergoing an important examination theologically (I will repeat here the problem of there being no solid evidence of ordained and fully invested female deacons in the entire history of the Church; and that I do not see that as being a reason not to do so now, only that we will have to ""invent"" the proper basis for a new doctrine) and we will have to, including our bishops, be patient and see what develops.  Don't burden your bishop with what he cannot really do.  Be your own voice and speak loudly!"
"Let's meet our lucky contestants!

Heading up the inquiry is BC's first female Indigenous Judge, Marion Buller
Next is Michele Audette of Innu descent and a former politician from Quebec
Brian Eyolfson is a Toronto-based Abroginal and Human rights lawyer, and former vice-chair of the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal
Meitis Constitutional Lawyer Marilyn Poitras from the University of Saskatchewan  is our fourth constestant, and rounding out the five is Qajaq Robinson, a Nunuvut-born Igloolik and former crown prosecutor in Nunuvut who currently practices at a firm in Ottawa

(Seems like between the 5 they have a lot of experience navigating both the Justice and political systems and are intimately familiar with Indigenous/Aboriginal issues. ""What are they doing?"" Excellent question)"
"One only has to look to Ontario to see what's in store for Canada.  Kathleen Wynne and her cronies have robbed the place blind and left a tab of $330,000,000,000 in debt.  Gerald Butts was an advisor to her and now Ottawa under Justine Trudeau is going down the exact same path.

Trudeau is going down as the worst PM in history, no amount of selfies or prancing around at gay pride parades is going to change that.  He's typically outmatched on the world stage and hands out goodies just to look good.  He recently waived VISA requirements on Romanian and Bulgarians, so we should be getting a new wave of thousands of 'refugees' from EUROPE any day now, well I guess we can just add it to the steaming pile of debt our grandkids, grandkids will be paying off."
I was one of the 'women's self defense' class members.  And I did use it.
"""Police said he beat her with a baseball bat early Sunday, drove off with her in his car and assaulted her again — they haven’t said how — before dumping her body in a pond near her home."" But according to police, there is no evidence of a hate crime. Virginia law defines a hate crime as one in which a person tries ""to intimidate or instill fear in people targeted for their race or religion."" What about for their gender? Why isn't rape a hate crime? Why isn't beating a woman to death and throwing her body in a pond a hate crime?"
"Why does Lee perceive it to be a negative that it is being nationally recognized that Hawaii has a new woman police chief? After all, women  account for only 13.0% of police officers in the U.S. I think it is terrific that (1) a great example is being put forth that women CAN become chief, and (2) there is heightened  scrutiny by a variety of news outlets of possible wrong-doing within HPD that is now being addressed."
"I am quite aware that they cannot interview every woman in Alaska and I did learn about statistics in high school, but the fact that such a study was based off of such a low percentage of the population and that this article was written so boldly still boggles my mind."
"If you are concerned about the fact that a GPS tracking device was planted under a woman's car, then you might also be concerned that you are most likely carrying one with you, where ever you go. 

It is called a ""cell phone"", and it is trivial to obtain the tracking information.

"I really hope that some old pale, stale, white guys don't all of a sudden decide they want to start dictating terms to women about their bodies. If so another Conservative false start... but.. if not then this could be exciting"
"Add to the fact that the Catholic Church is against gay marriage, abortion, assisted dying, and the ordination of women priests. 

It's hilarious seeing Kathleen Wynne and her supporters attack social conservatives for their beliefs when  the province of Ontario spends billions funding Catholic Schools."

"Your vote in November will be ""a hard decision?""
What are you thinking? That because your (he was mine, too, please note the verb tense) candidate didn't make it that Trump is as good as Hillary?
You do realize Hillary's strong women's rights history? Her pro-worker agenda these past thirty or so very public years?
Your failure to vote would make you complicit in the elimination of Obamacare. Of the stacking of a conservative Supreme Court that would reverse or gut Roe v Wade and other key progressive decisions. In mandating the forced expulsion of many folks that have established lives in this country. Perhaps worst of all: you'd have contributed to the uglification of this country, made it a place where vilifying women and minorities not only is tolerated, it is encouraged.
Please, Ms. Meyer, think long and hard."

"Right, lots of reasons that have nothing to do with her being a woman.

""I just don't like her.""
""I just don't trust her.""
""I just can't relate to her.""
""She just doesn't seem like a leader.""
""She doesn't have the stamina.""
""I can't stand the sound of her voice. She reminds me of my first wife.""
""I can't stand the sound of her voice. She reminds me of my mother.""

""I'm going to vote for Donald Trump because Hillary Clinton is corrupt.""
""I'm going to vote for Donald Trump because Hillary Clinton is too old.""
""I'm going to vote for Donald Trump because Hillary Clinton is fat.""
""I'm going to vote for Donald Trump because Hillary Clinton has been on TV forever, time for something new.""
""Ew! I can't vote for her. Her clothes are so frumpy!""
""Uh, something about her emails. I don't exactly know what.""
""I'll never vote for her because she didn't leave Bill Clinton when he cheated."" 

Nothing to do with her sex. Right."
"What're you talking about, jendal?  It's a cake walk alright.  Wait and see. Nothing but a tiny bump in the road.  Women, blacks, and Hispanics have Hillary's back.  The Rs know it and soon tRump will know it.  Nasty women will be coming out of the woodwork."
"Where have you been lady? Didn't you see & hear one of your leaders spew that? I see on Fox that she is under investigation at the moment, now, who's insane?"
Agreed. Also incorrect. Monsignor used to tease Michael about his trysts with women. It is sad that the fact that he left that life behnid has people calling him gay. Agreed on Trump. What is pathetic is that this thread advances because these folks cannot handle what is said about Francis and how that evicerates their Triumphalism.
"""Elsewhere in Syria, U.S.-led airstrikes killed at least 21 people, including a woman and her six children..""
Oh, that's okay. You're allowed to murder women and children as long as you don't use chemicals, and as long as you're the good guys and you call it ""war"". 
Has humanity gone completely insane?"
"Misogynistic? Perhaps from a cro-magnon point of view which believes that the responsibility of procreation lies solely if not at least more greatly upon the female.
I do not have this view, however, as I see the world through the eyes of Rob Base and (the late) DJ EZ Rock who stated ""It Takes Two"" (or perhaps three in the case of a same-sex couple with a surrogate).
Therefore, both (or all) parties must practice restraint not necessarily in copulation but in procreation until a scientifically-based, medical solution is found."
"Excellent! Those are your opinions-- and while I disagree with your interpretation of that protest in Toronto, I honour the right for you to say whatever pops into your head-- even if it doesn't remotely resemble reality.

The only rules are, don't incite violence and don't promote the genocide of any group. 

You are free to say that Jesus didn't exist, Islam is abusive to women, or Judaism is silly. That's not hate speech."
"Maybe she forgot to end the sentence, Nels Anderson Jr., with ""and let's go for lunch to discuss""."
"Yes, I know the arguments and find them weak. I don't particularly care about internecine squabbles within the Anglican Communion. Neither do I have any intention of joining the Episcopal Church (at the moment, anyway). However, I am pretty happy to ride out my self-imposed exile in a parish (?) headed by a woman priest. The service is quite similar to the beloved Catholic Mass. Furthermore I'm not skipping out on the Eucharist just because I'm furious with the Catholic Church.

So there."
"The environmental destruction polluting land, water, and governing system by the Corporate Oligarchy continues.  Real people/populist actions by the Billionaire Barons as their Fascist Republican employees begin the process of dismantling the entire governing system to be replaced by Der Fuhrer/CEO Trump with his Republican Board of Directors dismantling the entire governing structure.  The only regulations remaining will be those imposed by Fundamentalist Catholic/Christian Dogma to keep those unwashed/working classes under control with minimal wages, in their bedrooms, and in their required patriarchal family structures.  Women back to the kitchen and out of the workplace.  Ban contraception in order to birth maximum numbers of babies to be indoctrinated in Catholic/Christian schools.  Sounds new, but wait, doesn't this sound like past Native American policies?  A nation poised on the brink of destruction."
I wish they would file charges against Mrs. Clinton...she deserves every bit of it.
Maybe mommy Maggie can run the country while Gomer is showing off his new socks at the gender equality conference.
"How sad for both women, both the killer and victim.
 
It is easy to say 'lock her up' but the extenuating circumstances are extreme and woeful. If I understand correctly ""It was the 20th time the local Department of Human Services contacted Hanchett"" when she was a child in Arizona, living in extreme abuse.  How can such extreme abuse of children be allowed, even in Arizona?  Why did the State take no action to remove her from such a rotten environment?  We are all to blame!

I believe we can assume Hanchett was an emotional basket case that needed help, long before the crime.  It is understandable that she was in an abusive relationship at 18 years old.  Again, I must reiterate that our 'system' of mental health services is grossly deficient and under funded.  That is not to say that professionals could have 'saved' this poor individual, but at least she may have never gotten into the biker gang and the situation where she felt she had no option but killing another women."
Hmm SB91 passes and we get a spike in crime. Na not related at all. If you want to see at least one Alaskan idiot look in the mirror. SB91 is directly responsible for at least one death that being the female in Fairbanks who was released on OR after being arrested for DUI and was still a .240 who was later hit by a truck.
"warbirds

If you read my comment, I said ""elected Prime Minister"". Kim Campbell didn't win an election.

And my response was to the statement about female rights in Islam. Perhaps some humility and self reflection is in order. I know that a lot of people have a superiority complex about their own culture, and can't see the weakness and faults in it. Muslims are constantly reminded about their treatment of women, or minorities, or lack of democracy. Can you tell me what the weaknesses in western culture are?"
"In 2014, the Globe published a very good editorial titled; ""Are Native Leaders Ready To Be Part Of The Solution?"" It was an argument against holding an inquiry and instead focus the discussion on the rampant child physical and sexual abuse occurring every day on reserves.
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/are-native-leaders-ready-to-be-part-of-the-solution/article20259741/

Nearly three years later, the Globe posts another story titled: "" Stalled MMIW Inquiry Timeline Frustrates Communities."" That story once again mentioned rampant child physical and sexual abuse on reserves as being a primary reason that aboriginal women were going missing and being murdered. 
http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/stalled-mmiw-inquiry-timeline-frustrates-communities/article34982603/

That story attracted only two comments, both very accurate. Perhaps when the latest cultural appropriation crisis has passed the discussion could turn to more important things. Things where lives are at stake."
"I don't get that.  What makes you think would ""women, ""other cultures"" or minorities would have that reaction??"
"Not so sure. The CC in the US is nearly forty times the size of the EC in the US, which, after all, is a small Protestant Church -- ""Protestant"" as its legal title states (""The Protestant Episcopal Church in the United States"") -- with an entirely different polity from the CC. Any Protestant church community, of course, can pull it off, can pull off having women admitted to ministry, priesthood. The Methodists were successful earlier as were other Protestant communities, including the Episcopal Church. But short of an ecumenical Church Council (a Vatican III), the diverse, huge, 1.2 billion church community -- with 23 Eastern Catholic Churches (tied to Orthodox practice) -- could never pull it off like you suggest, like your little Protestant Episcopal parish did. Only global Church Councils prevail in Catholicism owing to its size, its first millennial history and tradition (shared with Orthodoxy) and its Eastern ecclesial diversity."
When a sensible woman like Lauren Southern debunks the wage gap myth the SJW horde foams at the mouth. Nothing scares the anti-deodorant mob of regressive leftists more than an empowered woman.
"They do not gutter talk about women. When was the last time you were in a locker room, high school? I seriously doubt you've been in a collegiate or professional locker room unless you were cleaning it."
"Sherman was a psychopathic murderer and a war criminal.  On his orders, tens of thousands of unarmed Southerners -both black and white- were killed, women were raped, crops and livestock were stolen, homes were burnt to the ground, non-combatants were tortured and imprisoned....and you feel that he deserves a statue. Sherman was one of the most vile war criminals of all time. Only those who are ignorant of history could eulogize him."
"This driver, no doubt, was driving with a Class A CDL.  CDL's manual required that drivers must look at least a quarter mile down the road and be aware of the environment and anticipate unexpected condition in the road or sides of the road.  Unless the woman ran out in front of the truck, the drive should've slowed down and avoided hitting her."
"Leech for BM?  Perhaps while she's building her wall she will mandate all women, people of colour, jews, muslims, the disabled and veterans to be removed from Canada?"
How many Muslim immigrants coming to Canada support the Muslim Brotherhood? Support Sharia law? Support the killing of homosexuals? Support the second class citizenship of women? Look at the statistics. The second generation is even more extreme. And you're worried La Meute?
"I wasn't aware that ""First Lady"" was a constitutional position...hmmm"
I can't believe they posted $1000 each bail..where'd that$$ come from all of a sudden...this is not ok..I'm also appalled it took a week for them to get back into the home. If these  ( I use that term loosely) don't have a psych eval than shame on the system because nobody lives like this unless they have a mental illness.

"James Hadd:  Did you suffer any hardship during those few hours on Saturday?   It was a peaceful march here, after all.   Your letter appears to be all rhetoric and you're not really asking anything.   
But I'll sincerely answer, briefly.  I marched out of deep *concern* for several things, as jadedjade mentions, especially women's reproductive rights.   Many are watching and will not remain silent...that was the gist of this march and I find that so encouraging.    
""This is what democracy looks like"""

"How about this list of moderate Muslim reformers  to start: 
Ayaan Hirsi Ali; Muslim Canadian Raheel Raza; Imam Tawhidi; Farid Esack; Mahmoud Mohammed Taha; Nasar Hamed Abu Zeid; Fatema Mernissi; Khalida Messaoudi; Shirin Ebadi; Dr. Majid Rafizadeh; Asma Jahangir & Hina Jilan.    Also go to these organizations to get even more ""Woman living under Muslim Laws"" http://www.wluml.org/  or The Henry Jackson Society http://henryjacksonsociety.org/about-the-society/; The Clarion Project would have many speakers to discuss the peaceful reformation of Islam."
"H R Clinton had a great line.  ""I take full responsibility "", then she went on to blame, and blame.  I saw how she treated a woman that had been raped by husband Bill.  The conversation and events were recorded.  She threatened the woman, and it frightened her, as the victim.   Then there is Monica Lewinsky.  Watch her ""Ted Talk"", very inspiring."
"She wanted a doctor she would feel comfortable with..one that spoke good English...she said it out loud...she sounded really rude but upset... now reporters are hounding her at her home...Kathleen Wynne says she is 'shocked'...I'm shocked at the Muslim woman who tried to kill white people at Canadian Tire with a golf club, then with a knife...I'm shocked that BLM continue to demand respect and credibility when one of their founders tweeted she want to kill 'white people'...what has been said about this woman by neighbours sounds as if she is someone who has problems with race... but she didn't threaten or behave violently...those who are racist and who raise their kids to be racist have a more difficult time in society  but it isn't news...they're allowed to be racist...so why this particular woman?

"This article shows a milestone in a special policy adopted in 80s , which recently started gaining more and more momentum. It started with TV shows, movies, books, reality shows, where men are depicted and irresponsible, selfish, childish persons. Look at pretty much every TV commercial,  how goofy husbands are, and  how balanced, smart, intelligent the wives are.  This propaganda got into people's minds. Both men and women  took these ideas as the truth about the reality.  People internalize ideas they perceive to be true. 

This article very precisely shows where we are with implementing this policy.   I would call it SUCCESS. Society is degraded. Congratulations political strategists. 

This is a good example on how people's perceptions can be manipulated and how targeted moral values be imposed on people."
I agree.  I notice that there are a lot of fat women in Anchorage and I'm one of em!
"I would agree with you, especially in regard to leaders and all Christians ""leading by spiritual example."" That's the bottom line, Shar_M. I was in three countries in Europe the last week and a half. One can't help noticing how secularism has taken over there, especially in northern Europe,  despite churches doing all they can to accommodate the population. The Anglican Church in England, for example, has bend over BACKWARDS trying to accommodate their flock -- allowing same sex civil unions among their clerics, openness to contraception, women bishops and priests, etc. -- yet still keeps crashing (hemorrhaging at more rapid rate than any other European nation -- dropping by 50% in just two decades). Even with their 26 unelected bishops sitting in their legislature/Parliament -- at the very top of the power structure -- they haven't been able to stem the drastic decline.
So what you say counts: holiness, spiritual example, simplicity, honesty. All the other changes don't seem to work."

If you think the investigations into Trump's activities are big deal,  you forget what Hillary had waiting for her after she had won.

"The Charter allows peaceful gatherings, so any attempt to restrict anti-abortion peaceful protest is unconstitutional. As the author says, though, if it isn't peaceful, it's illegal.

But I have to wonder the point of these protests. Women entering abortion clinics are undergoing a legitimate medical procedure, the moral significance of which is blown out of proportion by anti-abortion advocates.

It's also discriminatory because women going to hospital for an abortion can't be targeted because no-one can tell what they are going to hospital for."
"Take the time to look at those links and actually learn something. When Stanley Ann Dunham (the former President's mother, deceased) divorced Barak Sr., she married Lolo Soetoro and he adopted her son Barry so he could attend a Muslim public school in Indonesia.

"Thank you. Far too often, conservative pro-life folks tell us, as one prominent leader has, ""The zipper is the best contraceptive ever invented."" End of issues. When the issue is abortion, the answers too often relate to personal  condemnation of sexual activity and of a sexual culture as much as of abortion activity. And, therefore, I do think many pro-life advocates assign a distorted ""immoral equivalency"" to sexuality, feminism, contraception.....and abortion---disallowing or even pre-empting the serious ""WHY?"" talk you so correctly say is required. 

I could be wrong."

"Joan, it was obvious you sat this one out. After you said Paul Ryan exhibited leadership then said he didn't, I kept looking to these pages for yours and couldn't find it. Who cares if everyone already knew you ""were for her""? My impulse is to say ""Duh!"", but I have too much respect for you. Perhaps ""Why?"" is a more appropriate question this season.  I thought people looked to you for a prophetic voice, not a political pick. Another response to your absence has been to wonder why your column isn't followed by ""Benedictine Sr. Joan Chittister is a SOMETIME NCR contributor"".

She loudly and brashly declared to the bank teller ""Hi, I want to withdraw"" The teller, my wife related seemed stunned and disturbed by what he already knew he was about to participate in and stuttered: ""how....how much do you want?""  ""Alllit"" the woman slurred out in response.  WHY do we fight to protect the permanent fund? Let them cap it. Let those of us who work industrial and retail jobs for a living-and make an HONEST wage and live HONEST lives, reap the rewards as such and see the PFD for what it is-a simple bonus. The PFD may be a fiduciary success lauded the world over, but time changes things. No simpler than that."
"I read Clark's remarks.  She implies that in declining to take her advice, the Lieutenant Governor failed to ""prevent the dilution of our democracy.""  That is an outrageous smear.  As Clark of all people should know, it is the duty of the LG to appoint as premier the party leader she judges to be in the best position to command the confidence of the Legislature.  The LG did her duty in accordance with the conventions of our parliamentary system of government.  Clark owes the LG an apology for making such disparaging remarks and for trying to bring the office of LG into disrepute."
"People's dislike of Hanabusa does not stem from her being a woman.  In a way like Hillary

her business dealings with developer Jeff Stone which reportedly resulted in her getting a
very good deal on a condo at one of Stone's projects.  I think the feeling is that Hanabusa 
has always been about what is good for her pretty much  exclusively.  We already have a boatload

"Good for them, train often to prevent becoming a victim. 

A couple of points about the slant of the article. First, it has become cool to be racist as BLM has shown us. BLM and La Raza are far more in the public eye these days than the old guard racists like the KKK.  Being racist, specifically toward whites has become somewhat vogue. 

Secondly, training to protect yourself is fine but there is an underlying message here about protecting yourself from the police. Yes, police sometimes do make tragic mistakes, but the idea that you can somehow arm yourself to fight back is terrible. 

That aside, I applaud these women for taking necessary steps to protect themselves. I hope they know that training at least once per week is extremely important to build and maintain skills."

"Thanks again to Mr. Tammeus for a thought- provoking article. The suggestion for discernment about where the Holy Spirit is leading us is without ""circling of the ecclesial wagons"" is good.

I don't think shooting priests is the way to go. Yeah, I know that talk was in jest. Still............

"I remember a young woman killed the day after I registered by her boyfriend with a .44 mag--not a concealable weapon.  He walked onto campus, went to the registration area, she was at the first desk, he yarded her out the door and executed her.  Had her boyfriend known that carry was permitted on campus--which at the time it was not--maybe he would have backed off.  Maybe.
The point is, bad things happen when and where they happen.  You have no choice in the matter.  Carrying is being prepared against that time.  Our right, our duty, as the cops come after the fact, and the police have no obligation to protect or to provide services to anyone.
I am sick and tired of liberals creating criminal safe zones.  Why is the criminal always protected, but the law abiding are supposed to risk their lives to serve liberal policy that doesn't work?  Not one of their gun laws has prevented anything.

"Whatever, you hate women and wish them to suffer.  What other conclusion can be reached when you encourage young women to make choices that bring them pain and suffering.   It is you who supports predators by encouraging young women to drink irresponsibly and place themselves in dangerous situations.  Suppose we kill each drunk boy who has sex with a drunk woman.  Let's kill them quickly and summarily.  Do you think that will stop drunk on drunk sex.  Of course not because drinking ain't gonna stop and rational choices ain't gonna be made by those that get drunk.

Whatever hates women and wishes them to suffer.  Take Whatever's advice to disregard prudent choices and then when disaster occurs blame the boy if it makes you feel better.  Whatever seduces young women to follow his enticement to irresponsible behavior by misdirecting with ""don't blame the victim."""

"What kind of fool assumes women must make up 50% of any given field?

School teachers, nurses, child care workers, cleaners, etc are female dominated fields.  Why?  Because these fields appeal to the majority of women.  

If you want women to go to a field, make the field appeal to them.  Usually there are working conditions which turn women away from these fields (IE. lack of human interaction, poor work-life balance, dangerous).

Trying to force women to work in a field they don't like is stupid."
"She has five children, he has two. We don't know how many grandchildren they have, but I doubt they are all adults in their peak earning years.  So even if they all contributed $500 - $1000 that would't get her anywhere near the $50,000 she needs."
"It isn't.  You have allowed your prejudice to cloud your reasoning.  3% of Planned Parenthood's budget goes to abortion, and the Hyde Amendment prevents federal funds from being used for abortions except when a physician determines a pregnancy poses a risk of death or severe disability to the pregnant woman.

The fact is that in states like Texas that have repeatedly tried to defund or make illegal all Planned Parenthood clinics, poor women are left with no option for prenatal and neonatal health care, a situation that threatens the life of the mother and the life of the fetus or newborn.

Frankly, your deliberate slander is truly nasty.  Sorry to have to inform you."
"A substantive improvement to the TRO situation would entail a major overhaul of Hawaii's gun laws and I don't see that happening unless two or more high profile murders occur within the same year.  Think about it:  if a resident here had an imminent fear for his or her life and safety and didn't already own a gun, he or she is not going to be able to simply walk into a gun store and walk out with a gun and ammo.  There are numerous mandatory hoops and hurdles to negotiate before legal possession of a firearm occurs.

Personally, I'd be okay with women and anyone over the age of 60 being allowed some sort of expedited means of taking legal possession of a handgun if it can be shown that a TRO has been granted and remains in effect.  The problem, of course, involves the issues of fairness and discrimination.  Therefore, I don't see the political or popular will in Hawaii permitting that to happen."
"Correct me if I'm wrong, but when we are driving, we are obligated to obey the rules of the road. That being the case, we have every reason to believe that everyone else is obeying the rules as well. Good driving practices include being alert and anticipating the traffic around us. To what extent that is possible, I can' say. 
So, when driving down the freeway, it is reasonable to expect traffic in the traffic lanes to travel at the speed of other traffic. Maybe a deer jumps out or some other event causes someone to hit the brakes. Hopefully there is enough distance to stop, or there isn't a car in the next lane that would be hit if one swerves. We don't know why the woman stopped in a lane of traffic on the freeway, or if  Nytasha had eyes forward. I'll bet that Nytasha didn't expect the car in front of her on the freeway to stop. No one does."

"The opening line of this opinion statement is a broad based intolerant smear at Christians with no substance. Using terms like ""appears to be a lingering Nazi-salute"" is outrageous and has nothing to do with the Muslim families referenced in this article. 

Nice try, but the authors true hatred of anyone she disagrees with gives her permission in her own mind to tar them with a broad brush. 

This is no different than saying something like ""100 Christian families died when a church was set on fire in Pakistan and on the other side of the Country the local Iman encouraged everyone to join ISIS. These 2 stories are not related,  but tied together as a smear."
"The problem is most of the violence is coming from leftists at the moment.   Do you see conservatives bashing people at leftist gatherings?

Yet again, let Trump or a major conservative speaker come to town and riots break out.  Why is that?  Could it be that conservatives are actually more 'tolerant and inclusive' than liberals?"

"Yes, the things you mention are merely lip service: none of them will reduce the number of abortions. They may make it more difficult for poor women to access them, but they will also make it more likely that poor women will seek them. It's diabolical.
You object to my calling Clinton ""pro-choice""?? Would you prefer that I call her ""pro-life""? I nearly did; she far better fits that label than Trump does -- even if you reduce ""pro-life"" to ""anti-abortion"", as you and some others do.
Of course it's an abuse of language to describe Trump as ""pro-life""; even if you believe that his opposition to abortion is sincere, he nonetheless embraces a militantly anti-life agenda across a broad spectrum of issues, as I delineated in a previous post. Trump ""pro-life"": it's a preposterous notion."

These cases are indeed difficult to prosecute, however, due to the alcohol factor.   If a woman has drunken herself into an alcoholic daze, to the point where she cannot remember exactly what happened, and only has vague, unclear memories of events, that then harms any testimony that she may be able to give."

"Michael, I would love to agree with you but in this case there are numerous examples of criminals being released on laughably low bails.  Remember the recent article about the CHOP SHOP in Eagle River with possible ties to drug running?  I believe their bail was 500 & 750.  Definitely no more than 1500.  If this is how we treat organized crime you can imagine how lackadaisical we are with circumstantial criminals such as drug addicts.  Just yesterday police had to issue a bolo for a girl that had recently left prison for check forgery and various forms of theft and was already with her friends stealing vehicles again.  The bar is set SO low that criminals don't give 2 fucks.  We need to establish a system that prefers reform but also detracts from repeat offending. Alaska (and the USA in general) loves to cite all these wonderful examples from around the world but never comes up 2 the plate to fund them.

Rodrigues makes a claim-- ""when it comes to the life of children in the womb, the real question isn’t really about poverty, education""--which is patently absurd. The educational attainment and poverty level of women who intend to carry a pregnancy to term are very relevant issues. The conflation of pregnancies women intend to carry to term and those which will be medically terminated is an idiotic one which recently proposed laws requiring funerals for aborted embryos make clear. 92 % of all abortions are performed within the first 13 weeks and 66 percent of legal abortions occur within the first eight weeks of gestation. Embryos and fetuses cannot be legal citizens unless they are born. Women must consent to giving birth otherwise they are not citizens."

"The world is full of wealthy and privileged people and will always be that way. The issue is that many Liberals are masters at pretending to be average working people while living the 1% life style. Their groupies never seem to question the hypocrisy even when their guru is vacationing on a private island with another wealthy  friend and religious leader. And how about the feminist moniker? "" Doth Trudeau protest too much""?"
Ignorance and stupidity prevails with parents of the players   I find this common on girls sports teams as well particularly basketball and soccer.
"And to her credit, Sophie is trying to get the Canadian women who care about clothes, fashion, household decorating, etc. to look to Canadian producers first.  Shouldn't we applaud that she is enabling free advertising for Canadian products? She is going to be photographed and interviewed all over the world, being a showcase for Canada is the best way she can make it worthwhile.  Didn't Mila Mulroney do the same when her husband was in office - I seem to remember she was trying to the be Canadian counterpart of Nancy Regan?"

"I attended the event and was surprised hear Ms. Lukens say in her introduction that the UHM Chancellor's Thought Leader series was a partner in the event, same as when food writer Mark Bittman was on UHM last February.  When I inquired with the UHM Chancellor's office, I was told that UHM was NOT a sponsor or partner with the event, nor do they ""partner"" with CFS as indicated on their literature.  Individual faculty members may support CFS, but this does not indicate a partnership with UHM with CFS."
"You might read Matthew 23.  I'll break it down to the basics. Yes there are hypocrites. Jesus directed them to follow the word of the hypocrites but not their actions. In other words, what they are saying is correct. What they are doing isn't and they will pay an ultimate price for it one day."
"Good point! My thoughts on this do no harm comment went to how pathetically the public schools are trying to help the students learn to behave properly without use of any teaching of God and the Commandments, etc. They use techniques such as putting flags around the school with big bold words like Integrity and Respect to remind the students how to act. The ""do no harm"" idea is used by witches/wiccans. Unfortunately, the same ""do no harm"" wiccans see no harm being done when they escort women into abortion mills to help them to kill their own children. They definitely have a different perspective or ""value system""."
Get the homeless off the streets and give the parks back to people and their families. It's time to gather the homeless in a under used outdated school until a better solution is provided. If homeless gather at public places take away their pets and force them to keep their areas clean and yes provide them with bathrooms and a place to wash. Don't let this place get like San Diego with diseases being spread by homeless using the sidewalks and parks as toilets spreading serious illness forcing the city to power wash the sidewalks just so people can walk in the city without bringing the bacteria home.

Corner Gas was garbage and the only reason Canadians watched it is because its ""Canadian made""--it wasn't funny, inane and I had to turn it off each time after a few minutes of watching it. As for Bullard-he got what he deserved-for him to ""bad mouth"" CTV after they gave him a chance to have his own talk show was disgusting. Ironically the show that replaced his show on CTV (The Daily Show) pulled in far better ratings than he ever did anyway. As of April 2017 Bullard has got enough to worry about with his possible trial for harassing his ex-girlfriend (Cynthia Mulligan)"

"Truly sad that this happened anywhere, let alone a film set. What's even sadder, though, is the fact that nowhere is the dead actor mentioned by name. If it had been Reynolds, or Brolin who suffered even a minor injury while filming, the entertainment page would have given us a bold headline about it. This poor woman died horribly, and not one person associated with the film, not one journalist had the decency to honour her by giving her a name."

"I lived in an HOA community and got some nasty letters about my ""junked"" pick up that was legally licensed and insured. Another neighbor got a letter complaining about a deck she was adding. This gal hired a lawyer and did a little research. Turns out there was NO HOA!!!!! Just a bunch of busybodies that got together and decided they were the authority.One of these aholes used to walk her dog past my place on the other side of the street. My dog would go to the end of the drive and bark a friendly hello. One day the woman walked her dog on my side of the road and my dog stepped ONE paw into the street (I was watching). She called the sheriff and tried to get my dog arrested. Sheriff showed up and basically told me the woman was a b*tch and would tell her he gave me a ticket, which he didn't. Sold the place after that crap and moved to the country where I let the dogs roam free, shoot guns off my back porch and have all the junkers I want. Full redneck hillbilly."
"""The Premier said that fixing this problem will be the next major file she tackles. With the items on her agenda largely in motion – building infrastructure, bringing in a cap-and-trade system to drive down carbon emissions, increasing pension benefits and wrestling down the deficit – Ms. Wynne said two major education-related policies will form the core of her re-election bid in 2018.

The first will be creating 100,000 more child-care spaces over five years, in a move to make it easier for parents to join the work force.""

At this point, the reporter must asked the Premier if she could honestly state this with a straight face. I admire his fortitude for not breaking in uncontrolled laughter leaving him struggling for breath.

"The issue of abortion (which is what this discussion is about) is a moral issue of right or wrong, the authors point is to speak to women who want to murder their children by pointing out adopted children can and do ""thrive"", because many use the cop-out argument that babies should not be born into poverty etc. And the question about ""what if it is a woman"" I was referring the the ""women's rights"" crowd and asking them then why are they advocating killing female children ?

"Roberta B. Rinehart - in this country we don't make decisions based on personal preference, but on the Constitution and the basis of natural rights. I'm sorry you're afraid of guns, but your fear should not deprive other people of their natural right to protect themselves in the event of an attack much like what you describe. Rich people who can afford armed guards should not be the only ones who have a hope of being safe in this country.

And, no, getting rid of all the guns would not stop violence from occurring ... it would only make an uneven scenario where the bigger and stronger can overpower the smaller and weaker. Guns are an equalizer and as a woman who avoided being raped because of a gun, I refuse to allow you to make me a victim."
"If you believed Ms. Meredith, none of the  first ten Amendments to the Constitution would be applicable to anyone but the Congress.

The ""Due Process"" portion of the 14th Amendment has been  interpreted to do that.

"What we need is better cross-border law-enforcement cooperation. Ross was convicted in Canada of killing a woman AFTER he killed a woman here. If he could have been tried for both murders in a court recognized by both countries then after he'd done his 30+ years in Walla Walla we could have simply handed him over at the border to do the rest of his life in Canadian prison, which by all reports is easier time than one of ours, and then at least we'd be spared the expense of convicting him AGAIN here. He should at least be doing hard labor to symbolically repay his victims families. In all this pageantry of attempting to appear that Ross gets a ""fair"" trial there appears to be no concern for what's fair to the victims survivors, much less what would be just to do to him. All lives matter, but victims lives matter more than killers lives."

"As far as my cousin goes he wasn't a ""few"". Following the registry you can find plenty of people who have offenses over varying years.  That means reoffending.  They weren't a 1 & done type of offender.  I used the registry to avoid certain areas & to see who was in my area a few times.  Once I found out 4 lived in the same apartment bldg that kind of worried me since it was a 4plex.  2 had multiple offenses spanning years the other 2 only had 1 offense. Responsible people use the reg to decide where to raise their kiddos; but effective parenting means also keeping an eye out for friends and the creepy uncle. Growing up in AK 1 in 4 women have been raped, Sex assaulted or molested.  The rate of rape is the highest in the nation.  Obviously a low sentence wasn't deterring anyone from trying.

"I find it hilarious that Dallas is one of the sanctuary cities.  I grew up there and the blacks lived in south Dallas, the latinos lived in west Dallas, the lower middle class lived in east Dallas and the upper middle class and rich lived in north Dallas.  The freeways were narrow and obsolete so no one wanted to drive on them and this kept people living in the part of town they were from.  I, for one, stayed in an area of six square miles.  Going outside that area seemed like going from Europe to America in the 16th century.  Everyone I knew was a democrat and the only minorities we ever saw came up Thackeray St. in busses to work and steal in our homes.  Many didn't want them in their houses because these workers would pilfer kids toys, the silverware, jewels, or whatever they could get their hands on if it wasn't nailed down.  My mother lost our yardman because she paid into social security for him and he told her he had never paid income taxes and was afraid of the IRS."
Abortion is legal for a variety of constitutional reasons. Women want people like you to stay out of their lives. They do not have to justify themselves to anyone. The ultra-Republican right is passing anti-Women's rights laws with the intention of controlling our society. That is not Democratic but Theocratic.

"You are completely wrong about mercury in salmon. Pregnant women are not told to abstain entirely from fish. Long lived fish species bio accumulate mercury; salmon, being relatively short lived, collect very little. Where do you get this info? Dams are and have always been the beginning of the end for salmon. Take a little time in the evening and read up on depression era dam projects built in the Northwest on the Columbia and tributaries, follow the decline of the greatest wild salmon runs in North America in years following (here's one simplified source http://www2.kenyon.edu/projects/Dams/bbe02har.html). Reservoirs lead to warmer water, among other things, and they by nature block the ability of salmon to migrate upstream. Both of these effects are bad for salmon.

No dams on salmon streams or their tributaries!"
"Can't wait until the professional athlete and those taking a knee in a sign of solidarity of police brutally and social justice protest the cultural genocide of black abortions.

Cause the targeting of pregnant black Americans by Planned Parenthood is obviously racist.

Black abortions are five times higher than white abortions. By design?

So it's much more lethal to the overall number of African Americans...than cops.

Abortion doctors in the line of duty remove 2,500 potential African Americans for every one Black person killed by a cop in the line of duty.

So yeah, let's see all the support for a true black lives matter protest when a truly brave professional athlete and those like Pat Flynn take a knee to bring social justice attention to the abortion culture that targets the black community above all others."

Native life will go on as it has all along, but minus $53 million."
"In addition to the increase in the rate and number of abortions, if Trump and his allies succeed in stripping millions of people of health insurance, we will also see an increase in infant mortality and in the deaths of women in and after childbirth as they lack adequate pre- and post-natal care.  It's worth noting as well (because some putatively 'pro-life' people seem not to recognize it) that babies dead from lack of medical care and nutrition are just as dead as those who are dead from abortion."
"Think it through. In every country where women have reproductive choice, pretty much everything improves. Smaller families. Better fed families, better housing, better health care for them. Better education. Then the economy improves.

Clearly this will have an impact on that country's political situation.

So aside from human justice and human rights, many of you could stop whinging about the number of immigrants and refugees and whatever.

The idea that Trump is loud, outspoken, able to make a buck and doesn't cower down to the hard RIGHT makes him someone I will support - RATHER than a career criminal that has made it her life work to make herself 'rich & famous' Her lack of concern for Gays and Women in the countries she has accepted MILLIONS OF DOLLARS from should make women and Gays in America SICK!!

"I actually endured reading the whole thing.   First, I never used ISER or other UA resources nor did I use AKDOL for salary survey data as I didn't consider either sufficiently objective.   I barely even talked to AKDOL after the early '90s when their ""data"" was nothing more than union propaganda.   I'll be charitable and conclude that rather than shilling Democrat ""war on women"" propaganda, Berman just doesn't understand how State employment works.   You are extraordinarily unlikely to get a ""Widget-making Supervisor"" job from the street or even with a degree in Widget-making.   You get the mid to upper level jobs in a class by working your way up and promoting into them.   If you leave or lose your State job at that level, you're just another entry-level employee when you go to the private sector.   Frankly, unless you're a professional, the job that is legitimately worth $80 -100K with the State really doesn't qualify you for any more than a job that gets you a blue vest elsewhere."

"Can you just see yourself tying yourself up into knots, denying that Mary could be Queen of Heaven, not unless she got the position though her son the king, and not on her own merits, and not because there is historically, a 'Queen of Heaven.' Realize that 'king' means the Bridegroom in Pagan tradition, the one brutally sacrificed to fertilize the soil or whatever. Some 'kings' were even sacrificed in Yahweh's temple, presumably in front of a priestess representing the Queen of Heaven (the Bride), presumably after 'fornications' -- the sacred marriage. See (Ezechiel 43:7-9 (Catholic Douay)). Other versions might not show you 'carcasses of kings.' I'm not sure ""king"" is something you want to pin on the historical Jesus as did New Testament writers.

Jesus did not have a wife? John says the Bridegroom has a Bride (3:29)"

"Saudi Arabia's sartorial rules and customs regarding women don't apply only in religious settings but neither I suspect are they enforceable in non-religious settings for non-believers. I don't believe Mrs. Trump exhibited any degree of religious insensitivity by not covering her head when meeting Saudi Arabia's temporal leaders. Also, I suspect that as a Roman Catholic she chose to observe formal religious protocol when meeting the leader of her own faith, a decision that seems eminently and unassailably personal. My Roman Catholic mother, who was quite liberal, likely would have done the same thing. I'm not sure about customs related to visiting the Western Wall and whether its protocols are or can be applied to those who aren't Jewish, but I'm inclined to give Mrs. Trump the benefit of the doubt on this."
"Pardon my initial mistake. It is not the Central Intelligence Agency, the CIA that escorts the President and vice-President. It is as you note, the Secret Service, the SS.
I did note that ""The rally was about anti-abortion and appointing a Supreme Court justice 'who will uphold the God-given liberties enshrined in our Constitution in the tradition of the late and great Justice Antonin Scalia.'"" ""So [was] no surprise"" that ""pregnancy and motherhood were coincidental.""

"For the most part I am in agreement with the sentiment, and the establishment of a true picture of what happened in fact.  Can there be any doubt as to the prominence of women throughout.  To me though the thought out article does not go far enough.  Truth in pictorials must always be sought there and elsewhere.  What is not answered is why there is suffering, why the offering to appease a god through a killing and a few other things.  Is the passion of Jesus but a relfection of our growth in learning and discovery.  Can we ever get away from suffering and punishment.   What then is the accountability of an absolute, omniscient, immutable, omnibenevolent God.  Would such a God demand the humiliation, brutalizing, scorn and killing of a Son so that sin is forgiven and all humanity redeemed...makes no sense for eating a pomegranate...particularly since we now know Adam and Eve are non historical, no Original Sin, and no first couple."
"Donnelly College's diversity reflects the college's commitment to providing affordable education to students who might not otherwise have access.—Maria Benevento  That is not enough.  Readers deserve a smidge of how this “small Catholic school in Kansas City, Kansas, founded by the Benedictine Sisters of Mount St. Scholastica” manages to cut costs.  “God our savior, who wills everyone . . . to “come to knowledge of the truth” (1 Timothy 2:4).  Blessed be the Lord, for he has heard MY prayer” (Psalm 28:6), particularly with regard to minority students.  “Not even in Israel have I found such faith” (Luke 7:9).  The Faithful merit a better understanding of the administration that supports affordability happening."
"I have not voted for Trudeau and am not a fan of his at all; however his visit with Trump was exactly how it should have been.  One does not go in like a ""bull in a china shop"" on the first encounter.  Where this ""Trump is against women"" hatred comes from puzzles me when considering he received votes from large numbers of women according what was reported.   Plus one can say his daughter is one great example of having been raised to believe in being a woman and being absolutely successful, that must have been instilled in her at an early age.  I totally disagree with Leah McLaren."

"Your first para presumes to speak authoritatively about hylomorphism, but when you elaborate that hylomorphism (the metaphysical concept the everything consists of matter + form) equates with sexual dualism (female body has a female soul) you demonstrate that your understanding of Aristotelian hylomorphism if rather primitive. 

And when you elevate your simplistic understanding of hylomorphism to the status of Catholic doctrine, one hardly knows what to say, Purg.

While it is true that, since the seminary reforms instituted by the Council of Trent, there has been a powerful tendency to COMBINE Aristotelian philosophy as expressed by Thomas Aquinas (especially psychology and metaphysics) with theology by explaining many fundamental Christian concepts in terms of that psychology and metaphysics, one must always distinguish between a philosophy borrowed to explain theology, and doctrine itself.

Theology is not intrinsically tied to the truth/falseness of ANY philosophy."
"I had the good fortune to know a deacon, one of the first to seek ordination in our archdiocese, and who served with both holiness and humility for many years.  His wife, a convert and a poet, shared her talents as well, and the parish returned their love and devotion.  When Ray's wife died, he sought and received a dispensation to marry Joan from Pope John Paul II.  He continued his deacon ministry for many more years, and Joan shared her gifts as well - she was a founding member of our grieving ministry and inaugurated funeral luncheons as a regular part of our parish outreach.  Ray is gone now, and may he rest in peace!  The Church would do so much better if it learned how to say ""yes"" rather than ""no."""

Kip committed, in my opinion, one of, if not the most serious crime ""on the books.""  We can discuss and debate the concepts of rehabilitation and punishment indefinitely, but it won't change the enormity of Kip's crime.

"When I first entered the business world, an advertising agency in London, in the mid-fifties I could write a letter - or more precisely dictate a letter to be typed by a secretary from shorthand - in the morning which would be posted and delivered elsewhere in London by the afternoon of the same day. The recipient would respond and I'd receive his reply (it most often was his since females were confined to the secretarial pool) the next day. Most business was carried out by mail, not telephone. When that changed and the telephone became the favoured option, things began to speed up. I had less time to think about my reply ... and that one move began the remorseless increase in speed necessary to do business - through telex, then fax, then e-mail and so on until there was little time to think and business suffered.

When my siblings and I were young, there were thirty-four persons, counting our parents, in the generation just above ours.  As I entered my forties, I was aware that that generation was aging and passing; when my mother died a few years ago, they were all gone; and my siblings and cousins have taken their place: we're the older generation, and some of us are gone, too.  It's important to appreciate each other while we can, to tell the stories, to record them and pass them down.  I love the genealogies of Jesus that we find in Matthew and Luke, because they convey the importance of family and roots."

Faith-based organizations and churches have to be involved in order to contribute to the education of our children. Otherwise, when these 15 to 17 year-old teens grow-up to become adults, they have nothing to restrain them such as self-control, self-discipline, knowledge of right and wrong, knowledge of good and evil, and understanding of what is lawful and what is reckless lawlessness.Compassionate intervention is needed. *"

The Arkansas State Bar took away his license to practice his profession.  Only you, not history nor any reasonable observer,  would see Ken Starr as the chief villain here.  

Just because Bill and Hillary controlled the Democratic Party up until Hillary’s ignominious defeat doesn’t mean they controlled the truth about their corruption. Supporters like you enabled them and still do"
"What an awful and disgraceful article!

The writer is ignorant, biased and judgmental, and the content is shallow and misguided. Even worse--this garbage fails to live up to its own headline: where is the evidence the cops who pulled this woman over aren't racist??  Frankly, and clearly, the pretext of the stop wreaks of racial profiling, and any fool can surmise that.

These cops are lying about not having ever encountered a tag such as this; there are thousands of official vehicles traveling the state with similar credentials.

The worst part of this is there are people like this writer who are willing to make excuses for abhorrent, official racism such as this. 

This entire article is pure TRASH!"
"It was not zero-sum, because the woman could have enrolled elsewhere, if she was indeed qualified. In addition, while the notion that minorities are taking jobs and educational opportunities from White people (why should they deserve those opportunities more, broadly speaking?) while anyone can find anecdotal evidence to support any theory, there is no actual proof that White people are being singled out or in any real way, deprived."
"Rhodes University risks its future if it changes its name  -- you only have to look at the former UK polys who changed their names when the poly's were abolished and became universities to see what can be lost.
As for Rhodes's policies, most have been adopted by the present government (except Rhodes did not steal or fiddle the books.)
For example the ""notorious""  Glen Grey act on native policy was based on four principles: Work (a stated objective of the ANC government), segregation in native reserves to stop tribal land being sold to whites (the ANC is still trying to buy back land sold/stolen by whites who got round the act..), individual property rights (another ANC policy),  and local self government  i.e. giving self government to the chiefs (just what the ANC has implemented.)
So my vote is do not change.  And maybe push Cyril, the closest the ANC has to Rhodes, to spend his money on a university or three."

"Cd. Mueller certainly had not been silent prior to the dismissal meeting, so the pope did not need to ask him these putative questions, as the pope knew quite well the publicly-stated positions on women's ordination to the diaconate and priesthood, the repeal of celibacy, and the exhortation on the family ""Amoris Laetitia"" by Cd. Mueller. I am sure the pope had already decided to replace Cd. Mueller prior to their meeting, based on the 5-year term policy."
"""So either she plagiarized Michelle Obama, or she's a liar.""

I suspect both are true. Whether she wrote the speech or not, she's the speaker of record and the plagiarism is on her. But, for what it's worth, I also suspect the ""wrote it with as little help as possible"" line is a crock. Her English just isn't that good. Anyway, the conversation with Lauer was damage control in the wake of a highly embarrassing moment, so I take it all with a grain of salt.

Funny you should mention my Christian charity. Actually, lately I've been feeling too tempted to compromise it because of my anger about the state of our government and the world. I don't like feeling this way. I don't like feeling pulled into being uncharitable by what I see as the uncharitable behavior of others.

So maybe my sympathy for Melania is a bit of compensation for my negative feelings about her husband. Who knows? But what I do know is that she's harmless, so extending compassion to her really doesn't cost me much."
"(In two parts:  Part one)  Reflections from Liturgy of the Word, Reading 479, Monday of the Thirtieth Week in Ordinary Time II

Any pope who strives to remake this church into the image and likeness of God deserves our prayers, encouragement and undying gratitude. Too bad doing so has to be something to be identified as a difference from the actions of some other popes.—Jim McCrea
“Behave like God . . . “ (Ephesians 5:1)

What ""Francis is trying to do is make our church a more pastoral one"", meaning a church that is people-focused in liturgy - what is consistent with the meaning of the word ""liturgy"".—sylvester(pat)stefen

"No, part of the problem is the treaty with Canada which allows a certain number of fish to pass through rather than a percentage of the fish. The number of fish has no regard for smaller numbers or larger numbers, it is a set number. If it were percentages, they would get a bigger amount with larger numbers of fish and smaller with less, just like the fishermen. Finally (I saved the best for last), Lenora Hootch is not ignorant. She is a very intelligent woman and has been doing this her entire life. Lenora is executive director of one of the most intense jobs in the area. Learn to listen to the people who live there instead of judging."
"""Over the last year, every single country that I went to, without exception, where I would talk about how essential religious tolerance, religious respect, religious pluralism, religious freedom were, it was, 'What about your country and what's being said about Muslims?'

We are different.   Is the U.S. hostile to Muslim religious freedom because we forbid burkhas and female circumcision?

""Different.""  As if the U.S. could be equated with the persecutions by Muslims, going on in Africa and the Middle East, and in Asia.

"""Even as a college student, Ms. Morrissy Merick began blazing trails for women. She was the first woman to be named sports editor of The Cornell Daily Sun and the first woman admitted ..etc.""

And that's when her ""trail-blazing"" likely ended.  Vietnam makes the headline, but by the time Merick got to Saigon in the late 1960s, women reporters--as this obit suggests--were no big thing.  

What WAS a big thing were at least 3 women reporters in the country very early in the war, back around 1962 : Beverly Deepe (Newsweek); Marguerite Higgins (Vietnam was her third war); Pam Saunders--it was Saunders' unexpected appearance in front of Westmoreland on the border of Laos that prompted him to ban women from combat.

Some perspective: Merick worked for a fledgling TV network, the ""poor boy"" in comparison to CBS and NBC.  Everyone watched CBS' Cronkite.  Many watched NBC's Chet Huntley and David Brinkley.  But who was the ABC anchor? Hmm...

"How twisted can you get?
You obviously did not catch on to the spirit of liberation that prevailed in those pivotal years of the amazing 1960's.
  From women and gays to ethnic minorities, French-Canadians, workers,and the sexually repressed, everybody was transforming socially, sexually, politically, and culturally.
  Actually the blowing up of mail boxes was about over in 1967. What De Gaulle's speech did was wake up English speaking Quebecers to the need for liberating Quebecois from English domination. What followed was the ""Quiet Revolution"". Thankfully, very little violence ensued because the hippies and many other liberals, progressives, and enlightened folks woke up to the realization that Quebecois were second class citizens in their own province. The Quiet Revolution fortunately changed that."
"My, my, aren't you the presumptuous one.

My point to Dog On It was, that unless they install urinals in all women's bathrooms, nobody(gender re-assignment or otherwise) will be standing and peeing next someone's wife or daughter.

"Of course not, they are not women. If it was women being persecuted then we'd be hearing much, much more noise about this.  That being said however, I'm glad that the Canadian gov't is staying out of this.  It's none of their business and it's high times that thy focus their attention on the problems that we have here in Canada.  There are plenty by the way."
"""Most accomplished"" is a bit misleading.  Truth be told Danica Patrick is an average driver at best.  Her average finish in NASCAR's top-level series is 24th (bottom 40%).  In 180 starts she has very pedestrian stats - zero wins, zero top 5 finishes, 7 top 10s, and one pole.  She's led a grand total of 64 laps out of the 50575 laps she's completed (that's less than 1/10th of one percent of her total laps).  Her highest points finish is 24th (twice) all while driving for a team that has (not counting her stats) 21 wins, 116 Top 5s, 213 Top 10s and a NASCAR championship since she joined the series full-time.

I patiently await the day when a female driver who can contend for wins and championships comes along and makes us all forget about Danica."

"The problem is believing in Trump who is a liar that will say anything to benefit himself. Anyone that justifies voting for him based on one or two thing that he is saying ignores not only his past but also all the other thing he is saying. To elect a racist, bigot, women hating, fraudulent and corrupt person to represent this country because they ""appeal"" to oneself is part of the problem of why this country is going downhill. That is the irony of voting for Trump so he can change things when the vote itself is doing the same as before...."

"Archer,
GWB administration deleted 22 million emails with nary a media shrug.  Colin Powell advised Clinton to use a private server as he had done the same.  Were you outraged?  No, of course your weren't.

Your claim that she stole the nomination from Sanders is just bunk and Politifact and others have demonstrated that Sanders, with or without some at DNC sharing disparaging emails about Sanders, would not have even come close to winning the nomination.

The fact that you stake your Hillary views on Trump and GOP rhetoric and not on actual facts, tells me that you have other reasons for not liking Clinton.  You're not alone.  Many are uncomfortable with a woman becoming president."

"The common thread through this is that people like where they live and don't want it to change, whereas other people also recognize the positives in that location and move there, improving property values along the way.

All of that sounds positive.

Of course, the term ""gentrification"" and its racial connotations get attached to the whole process. At one time, the white folks had this part of town and minorities had that part of town. We can agree that was bad. The push to desegregate cities was on. That was good. Now that it's happened, it's suddenly bad again.

But the whole thing is very simply economics: More people want to live in certain areas than there is supply to accommodate them. The price goes up. Build where the dirt is cheaper, and now they paved paradise and put up a parking lot.

Hamilton's site and her books that defends against the RFRA's  so-called religious right Act that allows religion to cause harm to others, like women, other religions, genders and races. It is a bitter fight but I believe that women and others will win eventually. So I am not as pessimistic as you are."

"Re: “In Portland, a group of boaters actually posted a security guard at the dock…”

Martin, The initial article that was published by WW entitled “The Dock” caused the dock to turn into a party spot and was promoted as such by the WW. With people smoking and drinking and essentially blocking access for boaters who were simply trying to access the river, which is the one reason that the dock exist, river access. Do you forget the female breast cancer survivors dragonboat team who couldn’t even access their boat for an evening practice and were verbally accosted by a drunk, jack daniels bottle weilding “citizen” when they tried to move through the crowd?! This is what caused a security guard to get placed there, protection of boats and boaters trying to access the river, not keeping the public out. It amazing that you forget all of those events that were essentially the result of the publishing of that article.

Still not getting your facts straight, I’m not surprised."
"Bill 62 was not needed to address this point as veiled women already willingly unveil in a room before another woman to confirm identity and verify the passport. So, your point is irrelevant to the topic."
"What this says to me is Hillary is not a quitter. If one applied the same standards of honesty and work ethics to both candidates, Hillary looks like a winner, and Trump dishonest and lazy. Hillary stuck with it and made her imperfect marriage work, while Trump kept dumping wife's for ever cuter mistresses and trophy wives. Hillary is too battle hardened and seasoned for sainthood, but she is experienced and solid, and 99% honest with well thought out policy proposals. Is she 100% honest, no, she is after all a politician. Her dishonesty is being grossly exaggerated. Trump, is thin, hollow and inherently dishonest in comparison with numerous blatant proven lies in his stump speech and almost zero policy proposals. His principle proposal, he will do great and make America win again, says and means absolutely nothing. Set the meanness and meaningless rhetoric aside, put the lies, proposals and experience side by side, and think hard about what kind of country you want to live in."

"As an aside, it's a lazy, historical cliché, perpetrated often by the media itself, that the period of Nazism represented some kind of ""one off"", the nadir, the worst evil ever perpetrated by humans.  Horrific as it was, even in the same century more were murdered by Mao, and also by Stalin, than by Hitler.  And ever read what the Comanche did to captives?  If you survived the depredations inflicted on you when captured and made the ride back to the Comanche encampment it's likely the women would delight in slowly roasting and mutilating you to death over a period of days.  Humans all over, throughout history, are sometimes quite happy to be vicious animals - our own capacity for evil, that inconvenient truth, that's what needs to be remembered."

"Fanatical Muslims? Oh no, I am concerned about everyday Muslims, like those queried in the British survey.  The ones who, even though raised in a liberal western democracy, desire to have Islamic law applied. The ones who see nothing wrong with the subjugation of women, and who agree with medieval penalties for criticism of their religion. The ones for whom the hard won liberties that we now enjoy represent ""corruption"".

And again, you throw the ""white"" issue at me. I have said, repeatedly that the issue is Islam, not race.

Go ahead and recline back in your LaZboy. Sleep for 60, or 80, or 100 years. And when you wake up, the calls to prayer from the minarets in Canadian cities may be ringing in your ears, demanding that you report to prayers, or stay discretely quiet and out of sight.

Go to a Canadian college campus. Any public university. Check out the Islamic organizations and prayer spaces that operate there. And tell yourself that in a few years, they'll fade away."
"The report, and no doubt the conference totally ignores the fact that right across North Africa in the 1970s and to the mid 1980s, women liberated themselves, in dress, customs and economically, in an unprecedented way.  And they largely did it by themselves, without a grant, study group or expensive conference funded by well meaning ""western"" universities or UN body.
Then the majority caught religion and went, voluntarily, back to the customs of the 18th century. Women friends who have gone back to their villages in rural Morocco return shocked by the attitudes they hear in the separate women's quarters of previously open homes. Their sons and daughters are now the background of the terror movements who think they go to heaven by driving vans into crowds of men, women and children."

In my last visit to  Canterbury Cathedral I chatted with a woman priest about her acceptance within her community. She noted that with the laity there seemed to be no issue.

"Scott - I don't know why it is so hard, but then, I am not one who has to do the work.  I think John XXIII opened a door and JPII and BXVI fearfully did all they could to close it, shutting down voices that dared imagine a different understanding.  We have made an idol of the church and its teachings, thinking past and current theologians and popes can create an understanding that will last for all time.  

The Church needs the minds of people of today, especially women (as CAEL noted in her comment), but they need to listen to the lived experience of people of today.  And they need courageous minds such as Teilhard de Chardin, who dared to reimagine so much about God, creation, faith, what Jesus means in a world 2000 years away from Jewish and Roman culture and knowledge.  

The old rituals and sacraments do not keep faith fed and alive any more, do not allow the presence of Jesus to be realized in many lives and hearts today.  I think that is what is needed."

"Where do you see ""anger"" in anything I said? A deep psychological test would reveal lots of projection on your part.

Yes, there was a ""golden age"", but it did not last very long, as a more fundamentalist version of Islam took over. Is acknowledging this ""anger""?

The version of Islam dominant today in the world isn't the ""golden age"" version, it is the fundamentalist type. Do you deny that, too?

There were actually a lot more similarities between the three religions then, Judaism, Christianity and a ""golden age"" version of Islam, than there is now between the various versions of Islam, and the militant atheism and just indifference to religion dominant in the modern world.

There were not such radical differences in the way people conceived of the role of women, for one thing, and when everyone agrees religion is fundamental, there can be, and there was, lots of respectful discussions of various conceptions of what religious truth is. That won't happen today."

"In any event, women are still stoned to death or worse in Iran, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan - and this happens in 2017. The issues in Europe are a long time coming, what do we expect when we allow Saudi-funded religious schools and mosques to teach wahabi/salafi extremism under the guise of cultural relativism. There are widespread sympathies for sharia law in Europe and politicians react with political impotence - looking away and hoping for the best - we saw the impacts of political correctness with the sexual assaults of 1,400 girls in Rotherham. And we are surprised about the long term implications of doing nothing? Sweden is arguably the most leftwing progressive society in the world and they facing growing threats from extremists to the point that police are afraid of patrolling certain neighborhoods and they are fired for speaking out. What do we expect? A segregated culture that hates western values and we're surprised with what happens next?"

"""The criminal justice system is a very difficult place for sexual-assault complainants."" - Kim Stanton, Women’s Legal Education and Action Fund

That may be the case, but it is even more so in the case of someone accused of sexual assault. Guilty or innocent, the accused is under suspicion of committing a heinous crime and liable to severe penalties. Worse, as in this case, an innocent person may spend a very long time behind bars waiting for a trial and acquital.

We've reached the point now where some victim advocates decry any verdict but guilty in sexual assault cases. Even when the verdict is clearly correct, they impugn the justice system as stacked against the accuser. Should the accuser give contradictory testimony or even lie, that too is supposed to be a fault of the system.

Everyone, without regard to gender, is equal before the law."

"""limited to those who the elites of the day thought would/could exercise is wisely.""   See the word 'thought'?  

Women weren't even allowed to own property in many places in the 'civilized' world at the time, including the US.

If you don't want to be registered in Oregon under motor voter, you have to opt out.

""The law dictates that once residents interact with the state DMV – whether to get a license or ID for the first time, or renew an existing one – they’ll become registered to vote if they aren’t already. The registration will be provisional for 21 days, during which time applicants will be notified of their new status and be given a chance to become affiliated with a political party or to opt-out of the voting process altogether. In essence, Oregon will now be the first state to approach voting with an “opt-out” mindset, as opposed to “opt-in.”"

That's not small government, that's extremely intrusive big government.  I've not seen any Republican president in my lifetime (starting with Reagan) do anything to prove to my face they favor smaller government, only that they want to push around where the money in big government is allocated."

"End of Kaliphate? LOL. Dreaming in Technicolor.

Kaliphate is a state of mind in which 85% of Muslims (the Sunnis) live, and dream of.

Between 2 Abubakrs (the first Kaliph and last) Sunni Kaliphate was a drag on civilization curtailing trade and human progress for 1,400 years no less.

Socrates was done in by big business and banker Demos. 1000 years later Mohammed, allied with Christians to rout his Meccan Demos, ushering a new era of peace, justice, women's emancipation, free entreprise, and free trade.

But upon his death the neocon moneyed Demos hijacked his progressive revolution morphing it into Kaliphate of gore, glory, conquest, and colonialism, picking needless fight with Christians, imposing Tariffs (Arabic word) on East-West trade, finally blocking it altogether thus starving Christian Europe into half, and forcing them to find new routes to Asia and new lands.

Divine Hand bombed this nuri mosque; next is Mosque of Umar, the second Kaliph, god willing."
"Oddly I've not come across the phobia in question in medical or scientific journals. If you have Richard perhaps you could point me in the right direction. I suspect it has come to us via public relation pro's and, I'm just guessing, it's achieving it's goal of shutting down discussion on the ideology of Islam.

I don't think it's 'ignorant' to question, to be skeptical, to challenge an ideology. In fact it's fundamental to a healthy, free society. I think the above editorial, and indeed the pseudo word - Islamophobia, creates a divisive and polar situation that serves little purpose.

I see nothing fearful, irrational or otherwise in engaging in discussion regarding this ideology. Pull it out into the free marketplace of ideas and see if how it fairs."

Or perhaps you were practising writing some ""literary crap"" we're going to be force fed here for the next four years? Remember the old phrase, ""If you're not part of the solution, you're part of the problem""?

"""But alcohol has played a surprisingly important role in defining this nation, ""

Yet in-spite of the statement that correct claim, this article has skipped over the role alcohol and prohibition played in earning women the right to vote. 

Women's suffrage and prohibition went hand in hand. First-wave feminists pushed hard for prohibition. And those who supported prohibition supported first-wave feminism. The relationship between the two is a bit more nuanced but no historian would deny the essential connection.

It is rather shameful that this article misses this point, especially considering that it comes off as an understandable source on alcohol's ""role in defining this nation."""

"That opinion include rapists and pedophile miss ""womens Right""? Prison has 3 reasons to exist. 1, protect the public from dangerous people, and 2, which is second to 1 for a reason, Punish the offender enough so that he wont want to repeat his/her offense, and 3, rehabilitate the offender. 
The #1 goal is to defend society from those who do not wish to or are unable to abide by civilized rules. Ergo, it is counterproductive to just let them back into public without some measure of certainty that they wont repeat."
"Gary, what Trump has actually done as demagogue? He has whipped the conspiracy loonies in the Republican party into a frenzy, he has stoked the racists and inspired the misogynists but he has never participated in any kind of legislative or executive political act to the best of my knowledge. When it comes to Republican party policies that attack women, Donald Trump is blameless. As is commonly known, he was formerly a Democrat. 

If anything, the comparison is  unfair to Trump who is more obsessed with his own political fate than that of the degenerate and misogynistic party he currently is representing as a candidate. The guy is repulsive by any measure but, it must be conceded, he has only caused harm to the individual women he has forced himself on, whereas the Republican party has been very successful at attacking all American women's basic rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
The kind of values the Republican party represents has been clear for years."

And don't worry about your wife leaving you. The gov't has gender balance so you will be in contact with a lot more women -- that you can legally hit on. Many of them will have their own cottage, boats, house and luxury cars so you can fish and water ski at more than one lake.

The rape charge was vindicated and the state had to pay the victim years ago. But Armey's papers were sent to the dump.

A judge finally ruled on how that affects her case in 2015.

After a five-day hearing, Blankenship ruled Armey had no right to document the guards' activities, the prison was within its rights to punish her, and the state had no duty to retain evidence such as her papers after her conviction.

He blamed Armey for not arranging to have the papers taken somewhere else after she was told she couldn't keep them in her cell.""

"Trump acknowledged the video in which he brags of getting away with grabbing women's genitals non-consensually. You must know this proof because you claimed to have heard ""much worse.""

Many worldly individuals (including the sleazy Howard Stern) have attested that they don't hear others bragging about non-consensual sexual behaviors, in locker-rooms or anywhere. Perhaps one must be part of a sexual abusers prison unit, either for employment, incarceration, or ministry, in order to have heard ""much worse...from women.""

"If I were to wander through the southside of Chicago at dusk waving a stack of $100 bills, I'd very likely get robbed.  Not that anyone has a right to rob anyone else.  But deliberately increasing my chances of getting robbed is stupid.  And if someone told me I shouldn't have been putting myself at heightened risk, I doubt too many people would sympathize if I played the victim card.

That sexual assault is treated as so much worse than any other form of violent assault is more a reflection of society's squeamishness with sex than with any inherent degree of difference.  Why don't women report rape?  Fear of ridicule.  Fear of shame and embarrassment.  Factors not involved in other forms of assault.  And why?  Because of society's attitude toward sexual matters.  Once society grows up and changes its attitudes toward sex, sexual assault will not carry the same degree of shame, and there will be less reticence to report it."
"Hi, John - Brown does a good job on the history of attitudes toward sexuality. He doesn't address questions such as ""What does human sexuality say about God?"" -- other than the fact that most cultures have portrayed God as something of a prude and a misogynist. For example, from a female perspective, what does it say about God (and us) that female human beings have organs of pleasure as well as organs of reproduction, when female pleasure seems unrelated to either evolution or reproduction? 

These are questions asked by evolutionary biologists. In my opinion, they would have to form the basis for any theology of human sexuality."

As far as being proven right, how about a photo?  I'm curious if she was the same person I referred to in that other discussion.

"I'm not sure you understand how abortion works. There are mainly two ways women get abortions early in pregnancy: one is to take two pills. That doesn't require emergency facilities. One is a very short procedure to remove the growing cells inside the uterus. That also does not result in anything that requires emergency facilities. Those numbers are percentages, not based on total numbers. No woman who goes to a clinic gets either type of abortion with no screening. The women who do get abortions without medical screening are women who get illegal abortions, which is what women do in places abortion isn't available. These laws have nothing to do with safety. They have everything to do with controlling women's bodies and taking away their freedom. And putting women in the life-threatening situation of getting an illegal abortion."
"i don't see lewinsky as a victim.  she, of legal age, came on, played show and tell with clinton- according to monica herself being recorded by linda tripp.  made suggestive remarks regarding her underwear and eventually did show him her rear end. bill clinton aides, interviewed for a documentary (daily mail.co/UK)  are quoted that women were ""literally mesmerized"" by him and ""swarmed"" him.  i'm guessing lewinsky felt like a sweepstakes winner  - at that point.  she had big regrets afterward but nowhere is any kind of aggression used, except by her, to have sexual contact. as far as her public persona went down in esteem, then she felt bad... you can't take the effect  and make it the cause .

SO  - the  big difference being is that women want clinton, women do not want trump..not now or in the past from the sounds of it.  women he's had contact with are creeped out.

My mother, a life time Adventist, and dad, both long deceased, were devastated when I departed. Knowing in advance the effect it would have made it difficult to left. But I mentally accepted it would ""kill"" them in a certain sense because I could do no other. My mother once told me, ""You mean I did all this Adventist stuff for no reason?"" They couldn't see that I was following a higher value, integrity, honesty, and I didn't expect them to.

God and religion lives in the mind. Nothing exterior changed with the life of Christ. World conditions and people are the same as they have been for eons.

"Journalist Vanessa Beeley also says that escaped civilians were desperate to tell their stories to her.
Vanessa Beeley also says that she believes it would be impossible for anyone to be posting to Twitter from East Aleppo, because there is no 3G, no wi-fi, and no electricity. She suspects they're broadcasting from other regions, and pretending to be in East Aleppo.
Vanessa also mentions that civilians who escaped the rebels report that anyone who was suspected of supporting the Syrian government was be executed by the rebels. Also, a woman who was begging for food was shot by the rebels in the mouth, in public. It's insanity that the garbage and evil G&M care so much about their madman ideology that they're defending and supporting these actions by shielding them from public awareness, while creating fiction to demonize the Syrian army and Russia, who are putting a stop to these things.

"Aquinas was writing personal opinion, and it was not accepted by the Church.

The underlying theology of the Eucharist shared East and West is reflected in the constant, unwavering, and universal rejection of women in orders.

That provides the distinction between ""revealed truths, dogmatically defined as such, and provisional doctrines that may be amenable to further development"" in this case, which is that as Ordinatio Sacerdotalis stated, this is part of the Church's divine constitution.

Sorry, Luis, but that seems to end the conversation."
"You may prefer the repressive philosophy of many American conservatives but at least stick to facts.  ACA was a great improvement over what went before and with good will and bipartisanship we can make it better until we are sensible enough to free our businesses from having to provide health insurance at work and all have the functioning, more effective, and less expensive types of system that a number of countries have.

Obama also improved women's work place situations, stopped the insane and expensive policy from Bill Clinton known as ""don't ask, don't tell"",  added some environmental protections and helped stimulate the very lucrative jobs producing wind and solar industries, and got Iran to halt research into nuclear weapons for some years.   they were to be defensive weapons only but a lot of people want less nuclear weapons all around.   Obama did not do enough to reduce our own stockpile, however.   He warn't perfect, ya know."

There they have no go zones, and raping English women and the government wanting to placate it by telling its citizens to go along with with it? That's what Muslims are trying to do, wedge into the local governments and then change the laws to suit their interest, not ours! I don't believe a word she speaks as it is with a forked tongue, as the Indians used to say about back stabbing white peoples government who didn't honor their treaties with them!"

When I got to her, I asked whether she was looking for an address. Such a deluge of words came my way, not angry, just much faster than I am able to listen. She asked for a ride down my hill, I thought it best to take her out of my neighborhood, so I obliged her, driving to a BiMart much farther than my usual store. She wanted comfort in her dissolute and uncomfortable life, a place of safe rest where she could continue her poison. I will be very surprised if she is around in Spring 2018, I felt as though there'd been a corpse in my truck, so I went home and washed the saddle blanket I use to cover that seat. My wife sits there. 
At one time, I would have been able to pray for her. Now, I just think about her grandfather.

"Thank you, Father. I understand what the the topic was at the luncheon. But in the opening paragraphs the remarks of Archbishops Pierre and Tomasi are unbelievable.  Trump's worst is ""unpredictability""...really? Have they and Rome listened to his policies? Clinton's ideology is more threatening? In her political career she has done so much for women, children, families, 9/11 victims,  While part of the Obama administration she worked in DC with an obstructionist Congress who made it's life's work to shut down everything Obama tried to accomplish. Her policies tell of equality, accepting refugees, promoting jobs, working for climate control, strengthen gun control laws  etc. That's not  just ideology, it's life work.  I'll tell you what I think... why he's  just ""unpredictable"". After Trump said he was pro-life,  which is a stand he took only a few years ago,  they  found little else to talk about.  I'm pro-life. I believe in life from conception until death. It's NOT only abortion!"

Not that the execrable Bannons or Priebus were sexist for being angry at the trump mouthpiece but that the hosts of todays talk show are pointing out how upset her superiors at trump headquarters are with her. A team of vipers hissing and spitting venom at each other it appears. I hope the country can survive this embarrassing nightmare."

"""A women does not become pregnant when implantation happens. She is already pregnant when that happens. This means that a drug that prevents implantation is by definition an abortion inducing drug--not a contraceptive drug.""
And how does the hospital know a woman has conceived given that she was probably taken to the hospital after the rape or the next morning?  Emergency contraceptives have a very limited window to work.  Does the attending physician check the rape victim's cervical mucus and ask her intrusive questions about her cycle and only give her the contraceptive if he is satisfied she hasn't already ovulated?

"For people who believe that education is the answer, the above bit of obfuscation poses the question:  Do the people pushing SB89 really think that Planned Parenthood, or any women's reproductive health service, are marketing the abortion of fetuses as a ""product?""  Or are arguments like the above just a bit of political connivance on the part of so-called ""christian conservatives"" who've gotten a little too used pulling the strings and levers of the political machine?

Given the author's track record, I'd say the latter---But there are people out there who do believe these falsehoods, and would much rather have an ineffective program like abstinence-only education pushed in our public schools as the only sex ""education"" alternative.  

As  a father of a teen daughter, a product of Alaskan public schools, let me say this clearly:  Planned Parenthood's real ""product"" is education---By far the best anti-abortion effort out there."

"I have no knowledge of the St Patrick's Day march pro life issue.  Since I'm Polish, St Patrick's day marches were never all that important to me.

It is my understanding that pro life groups were not included in the sponsors of the March, but not denied the right to March and did have a visible presence in Washington.  The march in my State did not have this issue.  And of course the March was anti Trump because Trump was the one who implied he had a right to grab women's genitals and women would take it.  Hence the cat eared pink hats.  Do pro life women agree with Trump's take on women, because otherwise I am at a loss as to why all the angst.  At least three of my pro life friends marched on Saturday.  I never ran into them because the March was way bigger than we expected."
"The office of the US President is, or shall I say has been, one of the most well respected madam n most if the world.  The tweets are at times    pedantic, childish if not downright bullying.   Considering his wife's primary initiative was going to be cyber bullying. How sad, and not even ironic.   He may have suffered the slings and arrows of the media, but so have all that have come before him.  

Whether one agrees or disagrees with his policies or agenda, his behaviour is not commensurate with his office.  If my child had sent tweets similar to his to classmates, we would likely be sitting in the principal's office discussing this unacceptable behaviour.  Just like the many tweets you made before you were in office that were hollow regarding Obama's golf and travel bring excessive, you have far exceeded his progress to this point.  Another promise not kept.  Ivanka needs to take your phone and remote away from you before she leaves the WH from know on."
"Maybe one day technology used for quiet helicopters like the ones flying over Kahala, Hawaii Kai, etc rescuing abducted women a little over a year ago will be released. But I doubt it. Don't think we didn't make multiple attempts to get 911 to help in rescuing them. So when I hear about crime stats are lower, good. But doesn't make me feel any safer. HPD has yet to clear the scum out of our PD. Heck months later they dragged a mother out of her car at a DUI check point outside the HPD HQ, tased her and terrorized her in that police department. They said she was a prostitute. She had to stop breast feeding her two young children because they stuck her with a needle trying to figure out how to rape her. In the police department! Guess who was there trying to get a peek? We had to send people to get her out of there. I ranted & needed to. The tourism companies should find a solution. BTW ""Elizabeth"" is a Dutch woman abducted in 2014 rescued in 2016 by said helicopters. Hint hint, elbow."
"""Fear Trump, but have faith in the endurance of U.S. institutions.""

Actually, it's those US institutions, the same ones that sanctified slavery, genocide of American Indians, women, farmers and workers as second class citizens, the conquest by force of all North America,  that need change. The same institutions in the hands of elitist billionaires are what's been holding back democracy and the prosperity of working people. They were made to control people, not serve them.
  The Church, the military-industrial complex, Wall Street, the banks - these are the enemies of democracy. Now it's the dysfunctional Congress and multinational world-wide corporatocracy. Don't expect Trump to touch any of them. But folks need a dream.

  I liked Trump's way of passing power on to the people. Power to the people. That's what democracy is all about. Easy to say, difficult to do. But millions of folks will be reminding him about his declaration of democracy in the next four years."

I don’t car about Professor Barrett’s personal spirituality, individually or in groups.

"Community commitment means all members, not segregation by income.   The wealthy in are often at the forefront of community improvements, volunteer organizations and mentors to young professionals.

I don't think Brooks comments were only to the wealthy.   He talk about A wealthy person, and does not classify all wealthy people in the same way.  I have heard him kindly embrace the Gates foundation and the work of Warren Buffett.    

Brooks is making an appeal to the better angels in all of us.    As a Christian, the story of the woman with a single coin to contribute versus the more glorious tributes of the wealthy, rings a bell.   If God is used as surrogate for loving acceptance, then the size of the sacrifice matters, not the size of the contribution.

The poor are not inherently noble, the rich are not inherently greedy.   We are people, each with a unique background.  To judge by income alone is a mistake"

They want some special activity put on by local business, one contact months ago, nothing in between, then are miffed when we are surprised a few days before the event with their expectations.  Amazing.  The organizer was out of reach, one local candidate/legislator was totally rude and miffed because special long hours could not be arranged last minute for something they had months to deal with.  The activity was pulled off successfully, but, their total lack of organization leads us to believe this is why we have not successfully gained any traction on the economic abyss facing the state in our legislature.

The lady is entertaining to say the least. While one may question her motivation the reaction of the local Republican leadership is hilarious.  Perhaps they should query Reinhold Richard Priebus for guidance in accommodating candidates who are not certifiably insane.
Thanks for your thoughts Windwalker! I was reading though all of your comments and I am an abuse. I didn't get the impression you were blaming women for being raped.

"Why would they be riled up ?   Look at how much of a difference immigration has made - more rapes, molestations of women by muslim maniacs, freeloading of the welfare system, live action events like looting and protest on the streets by migrant muslim, more calls for Sharia law which apparently is superior to the Dutch legal system etc.  Maybe they should import more immigrants to really get the ball rolling and move the Neatherland back to the 7th century."

Too bad someone does not make a film about her and the 19 other independent sisters.  (I am sure there are more on other reserves.)  Now that would be worth watching.  Sigh.  I don't think they have the right soothing tone.  She doesn't believe the church will ever change.  They have a vested interest in the status quo.  Besides, you never ask the people who created the problem to change it.   They would have to admit they made a mistake.   Not going to happen.  At least according to Sister Catherine!"
"The most troubling thing here is the timeline attached.  A tier 2 CRC is for 5 years, renewable once.  A Tier 1 is for seven years, renewable indefinitely.  So if equity targets have to be met in 24 months, are universities going to 'kick out' their current chairs?  The other option is that in order to meet their equity targets, almost every single chair position that comes vacant in the next 2 years will have to go to a woman or a visible minority.

What exactly did you do prior to getting ASSAULTED? You failed to mention how exactly you were harmed?  Blood? Stitches? Broken bones? Or just bruised ego?  There is a reason the police discounted your side of their story and you have not gained anyone's sympathy here. IF you must vent, go make a formal complaint, complete with witnesses and evidence (photos) of the harm caused by the assault.  I'm sure the police took notes on what you said and what they said, and they probably have their license plate # that you so desperately wanted. Good luck."
"Back in September of 2016, Cardinal Paul-Andre Durocher proposed strongly [with the approval of other Cardinals from Quebec], that women be admitted as permanent deacons.  Where is the discussion of that going?  Wasn't there supposed to be a meeting with women theologians/scriptural &

"My 45 year old son lives on the street in Anchorage.  He is head injured and alcoholic.  He has a great heart and is often used by his ""friends"".   He has been beaten, robbed and falsely accused of violence by women who are trying to kill him; and subsequently jailed.  Because of his record he can not rent, get a job or live a normal life.  I haven't seen him in a couple years ... I call the DOC from time to time to see if he is in the system ... When he is I have mixed feelings but at least he is fed, housed and protected.  I don't hold out much hope for his survival on tha streets of Anchorage."

Thus igniting a nationwide war on groping, forcing, raping, and grabbing women's p___y because he's a so-called star and women like being manhandled, groped, and raped."

"Hersi Ali did try that and said that Islam needs to fix its own house first (end subjugation of women for example) in order to reduce the likelihood of extremism and for that criticism she had to flee Europe and take up residence in the US for her personal safety.

"Seems to me that that is a common excuse when in actuality, there are plenty of females (like me) who simply carry for self-defense.

"The MMIWG (and Girls) website states that at the request of First Nations communities, no hearings would take place during June, July and August so they wouldn't conflict with summer activities taking place then. Still, some families complained about delays. 

Now the ""accommodating"" inquiry has delayed the Thunder Bay hearing at the request of the community, and there are more complaints. (The headline of this article seems to blame the inquiry for the delay.) 

At this rate, and considering the trailer-hitch- throwing incident, when will the inquiry accomplish one of its stated goals of making Indigenous women feel ""safe, sacred, honoured and empowered""?"

"Right after it happened I was really upset because I heard that for the one second the bird was being flipped, the US suspended all predator drone assassinations in the middle east.  

A lot of people are questioning if this woman is ""really"" from Hawaii or not, and I think that's an important issue to get out there.  You know, because if she really was ""local"", she wouldn't be so selfish to want predator drone assassinations to be interrupted just so she can get all tantaran on national TV.

We need to stay focused on what's important for us as a community here in Hawaii, and that is making sure we're steady dropping fat bombs on foreign counties, remotely."
"The real question is how much ""biological reality"" is being overcome by individual achievement.    Google is hardly representative of society as a whole.    Each employee has been widely screened for desirable achievements, and attributes so what science says for the general population is no longer applicable, since Google is a pre-selected sub category of society.

This makes the entire argument kind of silly since you could very well argue ""science"" and point to ""statistics"" when in fact the statistics aren't applicable to the population sample you're talking about.

eg:  for the population as a whole, it may be true that there are gender stereotypes which favour one sex over the other.    But in a sub-population already screened for certain attributes, the exact opposite may be true.   Eg:  Women in STEM careers may actually be better at their jobs because they have overcome certain societal pressures as well as any genetic disadvantage to achieve what they have achieved."
The cardinal was speaking about female deacons that would NOT be ordained.
"For example, Lori Drew's prosecution for harassing Megan Meier via the internet was overturned.  Meier was the 13-year-old who committed suicide after Drew, a neighbor and an adult woman, created a fake persona and developed an online relationship her.   The intent was to  harm Megan and Drew succeeded.   

But . . . since that time several jurisdictions have passed laws that make Drew's actions a felony.   So, the bottom line is, while people do have an equal right to ""free speech,"" that right does not apply when the speech is a crime.  Americans don't have as much *right* to commit a crime as they do to First Amendment rights.   It's a distinction that seems to escape those who think all these things are the ""same.""   They aren't."
"When you sign-on to take an adventure trip where you acknowledge in writing that there is a possibility you could die, guess what? YOU COULD DIE. These women chose to do this and experienced the consequences. They chose it over choking on applesauce in a retirement community and good for them."

"If I am not mistaken , Alaska has the highest percentage per capita than any other state. I agree that the V A needs to work better for our Veterans. I , for one , can still vividly remember coming home to a greeting I never expected from nice little Catholic girls with a sense of indignation , and a cruel approach to welcoming home those that believed they were protecting you. We need to stop the Wars , but Korea is looking ripe for the picking. We need to lower Medical cost , instead of allowing 1000% arbitrary increases, for profit."
Trump threatens to sue everybody. When you have that much money why not.  But the truth is Trump would have to prove these women lied. In court many of those trusted employees who were around when these incidents happened  would have to testify under oath.  I doubt they all were paid so well that those employees would risk charges of lying under oath. I'd expect a few to come forward in their own defense and Donald's demise.
"""This delusional freak show is two hours of pretentious twaddle that tackles religion, paranoia, lust, rebellion, and a thirst for blood in a circus of grotesque debauchery to prove that being a woman requires emotional sacrifice and physical agony at the cost of everything else in life, including life itself. That may or may not be what Aronofsky had in mind, but it comes as close to a logical interpretation as any of the other lunk-headed ideas I’ve read or heard. The reviews, in which a group of equally pretentious critics frustratingly search for a deeper meaning, are even nuttier than the film itself. Using descriptions like “hermeneutic structure,” “phantasmagoric fantasia,” “cinematic Rorsach test” and “extended scream of existential rage,” they sure know how to leave you laughing.""

"Talk about making bogus excuses.  Hard drive memory storage is cheap.  Anyone who has security camera system will store up to a month or so of video from many cameras and when the hard drives(s) run out of space it overwrites the earliest video.  If the body camera video is routine why would you need to store it forever?  If something notable is captured on the body camera, you would immediately copy it separately and save it permanently.   All routine body camera videos should be stored up to a month and then overwritten with incoming new videos.  It wont work if the cop has the ability to turn off his camera.  Like on the mainland when a cop shot an unarmed woman from the police cruiser, the cops turned off their body camera before they arrived onto the scene.  If the cop could not have turned off his camera, it would have probably shown a panicked cop that shot first and asked questions later when the woman pounded on the car with her hands before going up to talk with the cops."

"I didn't vote for Obama.  Twice.  He for the most part didn't divert one inch from the horrifically destructive path of his predecessor, laid the groundwork for the current Da'esh (""ISIS"") nightmare and Iraq and Syria and led this nation further along the road to hell.

I refused to vote for either the Frumpy Horror Picture Show or Killary the Blood Countess because neither evil was lesser.  The former is perhaps 0.01% less dangerous than the latter, because Frumpy won't damage the world to the point where he himself is inconvenienced.  Killary would have let the missiles fly against whoever her handlers--mostly the Zionists--told her to, and shrieked with glee at the prospect.

"""The Charter and official multiculturalism were dreamt up before any one anticipated massive Islamic immigration with its radically different values.""

Ah! Now we finally get down to it. Your beef with immigration is specific to Muslims coming to Canada. Prejudicial views like that are anathema for government. The GoC can't make policy that discriminates based on religion, race, ethnicity, gender, age or mental or physical handicap. 

Your claim that the Charter preceded significant immigration from cultures that have restrictive views of the role of women is incorrect. Sikhs had already come to Canada in large numbers by 1982.

And finally, I have to wonder what it is you hold against women living in these restrictive cultures. The best hope they have to live a more free and fulfilling life is to come to Canada. Your plan will take that possibility away from them."

I would consider voting for the Conservative party but it is the racism and misogyny that seems to rear it's ugly head each election that turns me off. Last election the Conservatives tried to stir up support at the expense of the dress of Muslim women and then hired a known racist from Australia as a campaign manager. No matter how appealing the parties platform is I cannot support this type of intolerance and the idea of hurting fellow Canadians to garner political support. Since this leader has been compared to Harper I am obviously wondering how he feels about our minority groups and how tolerant he is of our rich ethnic diversity.
I wonder if they'd be as tolerant if it was a 'fearless woman' not a 'fearless girl'
"RIGHT!? Being a wife to a retired cop/dope addict/adulter is hardly a position to be proud of.

With all the fantastic inventions in science, why can't at the cellular level the alcohol be blocked before it passes through to baby.

We have had alcohol and pregnant women since the beginning of our species, why is it always a blaming game in humanity?

"I feel sorry for the left that can't understand why they lost power.  They blame the Russian, the Nazis, the KKK but the truth is the masses generally support Trumps immigration plan.

If someone from Somalia moves in next to me, refuses to learn English, wants my taxes to pay for them, has a bunch of goats and half naked kids running around, and has their women wearing a burka we are not going to be friends.  Americans are sick of people sneaking into the country for a better life, then trying to create the same crap whole they came from in our country.

"SAD - like so many on the Catholic right wing who are pro-birth, you are unable to understand the basic Roe v Wade arguments and the constitutional points that SCOTUS laid out in a 7-2 decision and now 40 years of case law on Roe v Wade.

-  Roe v. Wade grounds constitutional protections for women’s decision wheth­er to end a pregnancy in the Due Process Clauses. But in the four decades since Roe, the U.S. Supreme Court has come to recognize the abortion right as an equality right as well as a liberty right. In this Essay, we describe some distinctive features of equality arguments for abortion rights. We then show how, over time, the Court and individual Justices have begun to employ equal­ity arguments in analyzing the constitutionality of abortion restrictions. These arguments first appear inside of substantive due process case law, and then as claims on the Equal Protection Clause."

For me, being a feminist means that I am  beautiful as well as intelligent and freely pursue my own interests without restriction.  As a woman of a certain age,  I have encountered my share of closed doors.  My response has always been to keep trying until one of them opens, which they do eventually.  You don't need to act like a demented bag lady to get what you want.   Bring back civility, PLEASE!!"
"I didnt mean to suggest that they should keep him away, however if he doesnt have capacity then there are some serious issues about who is deciding for him and why he is put in those situations, it is potentially exploitative, especially where he is used to raise money etc, furthermore liability for his behaviour falls his decisionmakers so in a very d way they are responsible for his harrasing these young women.  Im sure the Former president gets treated a little differently from you and I but that actually makes him more likely to be abused in a sense.  Were one of these women to press charges, these would be the considerations if he does in fact lack capacity, however maybe he doesnt, and then he should be held responsible.  My doubt is do to the fact that by that age more than a 3rd of people suffer from dimentia and there is evidence of complicating pathology.  Only those who know him well could say whether he exhibits patholigical behaviour."
"6 year old statistics can be topped by more current research and this information proves the point about what BMI is intended for...  A population group,  not individuals.  

Does obesity lead to health problems? Yes,  we know that.  Is it that cut and dry? No,  it's not.  More and more research is showing someone can carry ""above optimal"" weight or have a ""high"" BMI and still be a fit,  healthy person.  I consider myself an example of that.  I used to carry an additional 110lb from what I do now.  I've kept it off for about 10 years.  My BMI is ""overweight"",  almost ""obese"".  My body fat percent is 22%.  For females 25-29% is considered medically acceptable while 21-24% is considered fitness level.  If I let the scale and BMI determine my fitness or health or predict my future that would be silly! It's much more complex than that. 

Your goals may be to help or educate others.  Your technique and delivery need work if you want your audience to receive what you have to say."
"Who really is against women$  Progressives (who if you look at world history are really regressive) who have made 70 % of women low-wage slaves.  This is why they try to tell us that women are paid less.  They are only paid less in reality because most have low paid jobs, (that most women hate) exactly the same as the general population worldwide.  You've come a long way baby!  You could have been a lot happier letting hubby slave while chillin' and watch 'in soaps."
"Trump is a racist sympathizer.
He single-handedly used his wealth and fame to perpetuate the lie – wholly racist in nature – that President Obama was not born in the United States.
He has declared his intention to deport millions of law-abiding Muslims, ban immigration of Muslims, and has called Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists.
He openly accepted the support of avowed white supremacists during his campaign and has done virtually nothing to distance himself from these groups and their political aims since.
The neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups that marched in Charlottesville are similarly transparent in their purpose.
They believe in the supremacy of white European Christians over, well, everyone else.
In particular, they want to eliminate Jews and Blacks, and Latinos, Muslims, LGBTQ folks, feminists (perhaps women, generally), Catholics, and many others.
There is no mystery here."
Why? Anti-Semites have a Jew fixation. It comes with their mother's milk.

Oh No !

"im glad she talked to trump. if everyone did, maybe he would see the errors of some of his appointments and statements. a no fly zone, as envisioned by clinton, was an area in syria, agreed to by syria, russia and the u.s. where syrian civilians could flee to and not be bombed by anyone. i wonder is tusli noticed that trump didnt invite any ugly, black, hispanic, muslim, or any other, congresswomen to join the discussion."
"As per usual, Elise Patkotak is completely wrong. Hillary Clinton isn't some glass ceiling shattering model for self-empowered women. Every significant achievement in her life came on the coat tails of her husband.
- She gets a job at a prestigious law firm... Right after her husband becomes AG of Arkansas
- She gets made partner of same law firm... Right after her husband becomes Governor of Arkansas
- She was chair person of the Task Force on National Healthcare... Because her husband appointed her to the position.
- She becomes Senator of NY, despite never having lived there before... Right after her husband finishes his terms as POTUS.
Donald Trump is more of a feminist than Hillary Clinton."
"By the sheer number of black-on-black murders that occur every single day in places like Oakland and Chicago , apparently some African Americans themselves didn't get the #BlackLivesMatter memo.

Every single day a person will shoot and kill another over basketball shoes, drug territory, a woman, cheating in a dice game,  wearing the "" wrong colors "", or crashing  a party,  shooting and killing even  the babies and children of a neighborhood rival, estranged spouse, relative, etc.

In so many of these incidents, a person committed a crime and then resists arrest for that crime or interferes with the investigation, and it often escalates to police having to use force when their lives AND the surrounding public's lives are in immediate danger. 

The family of Sterling still refuse to acknowledge their son brandished a firearm to intimidate and fend off a transient begging for money, who then called 9-1-1, and then Sterling resisted arrest. I'll save my sympathy on those who deserve it."
"Thank you Michael.  That is a really nice compliment.  I think you would make a good elder too.  You are right about the family and house Eucharist too.  This is already happening some in Europe with lay people having Eucharistic Celebrations, and Roman Catholic Women Priests often presiding in homes too."
"What if women LIKE to work?

???????"
"There was a statement made about re-opening old cases as one of the goals of the inquiry if there was a reset. Perhaps this is where it went wrong, people might have thought that this would happen. It is not a judiciary body and simply does not have this power. You might well wonder on what basis they would reopen cases, certainly not on anecdotal evidence, as the justice system needs more then a story with no supporting evidence. with respect to the missing women, it's hard to come up with an answer for this. People go missing all the time, and most don't want to be found. The government could provide resources to look for them , but in fairness they need to look for non-aboriginals as well. When the inquiry was first talked about and later when it was announced it never clearly articulated what the purpose or goals were. If this had been spelled out, it is unlikely it would be in the mess it is today."
"I am sure we could tear everyone down without much effort, and every person memorialized with a statue or a day has warts.  That isn't the point--we celebrate them for the amazing things they did.  Do we reject MLK because he was unfaithful to his wife?  Should we pass on Lincoln because he only freed slaves in the unoccupied south--a calculated political move?  Our collective heritage of imperfect people doing amazing things, like Columbus leading the voyage of those three tiny ships into the unknown, should be celebrated, and still is all across North and South America.  I wish we spent more time finding heroes to inspire us to greatness rather than tearing everything down."
"Well you don't get much time for a hit and run if you kill some one. If you are a young white girl anyways. So why not run off, call your rig in stolen, if caught they won't do much. This case the driver is older and only minor injuries so they will throw the book at this one? No the bar has been set low. So if you throw away your registration the cops won't know the rig is yours?"
What crime did SHE commit?  You are accusing her???  Putting HER on trial???  It's unbelievable how much some here hate women and can't understand why they are called misogynists!
"Madame? Be original.. Or was that another rape jar for a woman set up at BOG meeting that you cockroaches contributed too and had not the decency to remove? That made the news too, should I post a link?"
"Another social engineering stab into the heart of logic from the diversity obsessed party of Canada.  If they put as much effort into actual problems instead of trying to address problems that don't really exist we would be much further ahead but who cares about those silly things like jobs, the environment, taxes, housing, etc.  A patriarchy that doesn't exist and a gender wage gap that is an outright lie adds up to a great time to be a woman in Canada, ask and you shall receive. Until the next election."
"Now now motley.....   LOL.   You're suggesting a rule that we can't hold our wive's hand or kiss her public - NO showing sexual orientation in public!

I have no complaint with mothers, lesbians or environmentalist.   But I hate that we have become a society of identity politics.  We're consumed with what separates us from our neighbors, not what we may have in common.

Human's are a very diverse species and certainly are more intermingled both physically and culturally than at any time in history.   It's a clash of civilization, large and small, that can no longer live in isolation.    We have to learn to be civil or we'll live in perpetual anger.

That's a very idealistic hope, not one I expect to see in this lifetime — but it would be good to nudge it in that direction.  .

"Why do we become responsible for them, most in my experience, if not all will identify from one Arab country or another so give them and there family a ticket home at least they will be happy back in the environment they desire. I am all for them staying here but they have to remember this place is different with new values. For example, we in this country eliminated slavery 100 of years ago why it may still part of who they are. When I worked over there it surprised me how fast the Arab Canadian citizens came back to their  Arab values like enslaving their domestic help, getting a second wife, wearing the garb. I found it very unnerving to see, even after these people lived in Canada for many years. How fast they retrograded back, maybe the right thing to do for all is to leave them there, after all it is a lot cheaper to move an Arab to Saudie than to Canada and it will be a place that feels like home."
"CBS Evening News interviewed a Canadian woman with her Canadian passport in hand, who had just been released after 5 hours of questioning because she was a dual citizen with one of the countries on the list.  It is NOT true that they are not being discriminated against and held for hours in US airports."
It was legal to smoke before the vote and has been for decades. This woman driver must be a moron not stopping before you enter a street. Basic driving rules. Look both ways especially if you are wasted. 😆. Besides what about the legislative PR person who plowed into pedestrians in parking lot drunk. Didn't look both ways or behind her before backing up. She was leaving Taj-Hawker and had been working drunk. Yet her co-workers didnt see a problem with booze.
Well if she was reaching out to an ex...that makes it okay to shoot an innocent baby and the woman that gave him life...?Not! Can you believe the ppl that are trying to make this okay?

"These two educators have no place in education, but I too am appalled at the double standard and curious why so few see a parallel with D. Trump.    This is probably not the only time they have shared snide remarks about females' bodies.  Further, it is very likely they were encouraged to express their opinions of these girls by the comments and actions of our President."
"This woman has the cold, dead eyes of a serial killer. If it wasn't her poor hapless dupe of a boyfriend, it likely would've been someone else. Lock her up and throw the key into a deep river."
"Well yeah!  

In the middle of the street, just like he said.......... Trump assured us he was a straight shooter.

I wish on Saturday someone had given him the chance....... just once......that poor girl might still be alive....."
"It makes me a very happy woman--to finally have a candidate to vote for who is no passive bystander to injustice, violence against women, unequal pay, racism; freebies like subsidies, lousy profit sharing, price gouging, loopholes for corporate masters; rightly finds bullying, mysogynistic/racist brutes deplorable; rejects government-compelled, unpaid/forced child-bearing/rearing of future laborers on the backs of women; and champions affordable, accessible health care. Every Alaskan who has ever used Denali Kid Care to cover healthcare costs for their child owes Hillary and her clever expertise on government workings their vote, big time. Her CHIP bill is just one example of great things she will do."
"> The March federal budget came with the gender-based budget statement.

Well actually no. It came with a female-based budget statement, which is what passes for ""equity"" these days. 

Keep at it Justin and the next election you may find you have a whole bunch of people who have decided not to listen to you anymore."
"Agreed.  BTW, Twitler and his tRumpfkins will blame the woman, i.e. Hillary."
Bullying has gotten worse with the invention of the uber-democratic entity known as the Internet. So I don't think it has a connection to patriarchy. Some of the most vicious Internet trolls and taunters are females.
The woman's testimony is that she doesn't remember.

"He actually has several hotels overseas, including some in the middle east.   You don't mean 'conspiracy theory' sexist 'you have to vote for me because I am a woman' Hillary do you?  Also,  it is the left that has race on the brain.   I for one do not oppose Obama because of his skin color.  I would have happily voted for Ben Carson if he had lasted.  Also, another candidate I would have voted for was Carly Fiona.   So let us not say I'm sexist.  As far as Trump's competency is concerned, he had to have some to get the hotels built.   
I also agree Obama's record of disasters speaks for itself.  I believe that Obama's record is one of those subjects that we are going to  have to agree to disagree on."
"There is only one Islam - there's no such thing as moderates or extremists as such is a western concept, a western hope.

"Mother of Charlottesville victim, Heather Heyer has a message for Trump:
""You can't wash this one away by shaking my hand and saying I'm sorry.""
Ms. Bro says she received “frantic messages” from Trump’s press secretaries during her daughter’s funeral (these sick people!) and later that day; she was willing to speak to Trump at that point but simply missed his calls since she was occupied with burying her child, who was murdered by a Trump-supporting Nazi.
But after seeing a clip of Trump drawing equivalence between her daughter and other counterprotesters and the white supremacist mob, Bro is no longer willing to speak to Trump.
Good for her."
Best to get in touch with K-All for that stuff.  Girls play ball too.
"The OP said she had never broken the law. I was correcting him. She was a regular drug user at the time of the incident and until a few weeks before her testimony. Crack cocaine. 

I don't understand why you weight the trial judges hindsight more than the judge who had her in his courtroom. In any event, it doesn't support your position. The trial judge says her testimony is only reliable AFTER she was able to straighten out. This supports the decision to keep her in a safe place for a period long enough for her to resolve some of her issues. In fact, he says that her earlier testimony was unreliable and not indicative of her normal state. That was AFTER a night at a hotel. They clearly needed to take further action to help this woman.

What I don't understand is why you want a dangerous offender free on the street. That could be the only reason you would argue against what turned out to be a successful result in a very difficult situation."

"An excellent Brazilian theologian and a sociologist, Leonardo Boff,  recently wrote: ""Every year in Brazil about 800,000 illegal abortions are performed.""

Embryologists have shown us over the past 30 years that from 60% to 80% of normal blasto-cysts, in non-hormonally stimulated women, fail to implant. They pass through the woman's uterus and are simply lost in the woman’s normal menstruation period, without the woman even taking notice of the phenomenon.

Presented with a false dichotomy, Jesus points in another direction."

Mr. Trudeau needs to walk the walk. His government's proposed small business tax changes most vehemently punish female small business owners that use their retained earnings to keep their businesses afloat while they take time off for their maternity leave.
"Yes and if the family is really, really poor, there's no doubt He would agree with abortion too. For the good of the child, of course. What sort of life would ""it"" have?

"This idea of the United States as a ""proposition nation"" is a falsehood and pure propaganda. Parker even contradicts herself in one sentence and reveals that even she doesn't believe it - ""[America] was a belief made real by an implausible convention of brilliant minds and the enduring courage of generations who fought and died""

If it took generations to create America, then how can America be an idea? I am an American BECAUSE I descended from people that built this country, carved it out of the wilderness, that followed the rule of law; not because I apparently prescribe to some nebulous, always-changing set of beliefs dictated by new yorker-Israeli dual citizens.

"What do you know about any woman who works for the Church?  What do you mean about 'run of the mill woman'?  Exactly who are you referring to?  Cleaning women, sacristans?  Hmm?  The chancery and/or typical parish today has MORE women working than just the bishop's secretary or the parish secretary.

What about university/college collage professors with PH D's + or heads of social institutes, health facilities, senior health care facilities, pastoral associates, directors of religious formation, youth directors, directors of sacramental preparation, directors of bereavement, musicians, accountants, technicians for computer services [parish or diocesan], parish-life communications directors, etc.?  

I am describing women who make up 98% of the church's workers.  And the church would NOT be able to carry out much, if any of its ministry today, without them.  The women deserve health care and they deserve to have free contraception."
"Just because the west no longer burns witches doesn't mean countries governed by Islamic law are owed a 600 year grace period to civilize. Secondly, when May finally says what everyone is thinking (in terms of accommodating regressive cultural practices) - she is attacked in the press. People who are sympathetic to extremism and sharia law do not need to be accommodated, they need to be confronted head on. Cultural segregation spread through private religious schools and the radical views of transplanted Imams need to be addressed head on with a full auditing of religious donations and direct government oversight of religious schools. Sharia law is not a function of cultural relativism - it is a system of beliefs that is fundamentally incompatible with pluralism and should be called out accordingly."
"Two comments Mr. Rhyner, First, abortion is legal in this country and has been for decades. Two, there has been a watershed opinion change on the issue of abortion in this country over the last 10+ years. 60+% of Americans now support a woman's right to choose. The anti-abortion stance of Bible Thumpers is now a minority opinion in a more enlightened American society. If anti-abortion folks won't allow their pregnant teenage daughters to have an abortion, that's fine and their right. But don't cram your personal religious views down the throats of the majority who support Pro Choice. Remember the critical Constitutional notion of the separation between Church and State, however inconvenient that might be for you."

"The RCMP is in desperate need of internal reform.  It's drifted so far from it's mandate and has developed a toxic culture of systemic racism, harassment and bullying towards women, oppression of minorities and of those who reside on the lower classes.

We've seen them lie and mislead parliament about the destruction of registry data, commit indictable offenses in High River including break and enter and theft of property, commit abuses against women in Haiti, we've seen the thin blue line pop up many times when officers protect and cover-up the unlawful actions of fellow officers, we've seen countless oppressive and brutal tactics against Canadians.

Can you recall the last time you actually felt ok having RCMP around or do you just want them around when there is no other choice?

The red surge has become now become a disgrace to Canada, and this article leads me to believe they are culturally blind to just how toxic they have become as there is no mention of police reform"

I notice you brought up Orthodox Jews, I was shocked to see there were no pride events in Tehran this year - cultural relativism or are there no gays in Iran? And Catholicism, I agree the official position on birth control is inexcusable but is it any different in countries ""governed"" by Islamic law? If anything it's worse, especially for victims of sexual assault. Are we talking about politics, culture, or religion, I guess with Islamism it's the same thing, perhaps we should give a 500 year grace period because of Salem witch trials and Inquisitions etc. I mean women can drive in the Kingdom but meanwhile Erdogan is rolling back 90 years of secular progress in Turkey so it kind of cancels out. Ontario religious schools teaching boys and girls they are forbidden from physical contact with the opposite sex, #diversity?"
"Getting sick of hearing about this. Many women make false rape accusations and we can't pretend that it never happens. Read about the Edmonton cab driver who was falsely accused because some drunk women didn't want to pay their fare, lucky for him he had a security camera which exonerated him. Feminists aren't going to be satisfied until there is a guilty until proven innocent standard for sexual assault cases. We can't let it happen. Women who make false accusations should get the same punishment that a rapist would get, pay restitution to the wrongly accused and be put on a sex offender registry for life. Accused people should remain anonymous unless actually convicted with solid evidence, not he said/she said cases."
"I'm female, approaching my sixth decade, and I lift because my mother had severe osteoporosis. I do not want to be that frail old lady with the walker who breaks an ankle just standing up (yes, that really happened to her).
I've been active all my life, including lifting weights off an on, mostly in winter. It paid off with my first bone density scan at age 50, which showed that my bone density was ""normal"" - by which they mean  ""like an average 30 year old"". It has quite likely gone down a bit in the last 9 years, but I lift very heavy weights and am very, very, strong for a woman of any age. Why not? I went to an automotive store last week and bought a car battery. I didn't need any help lifting it into the shopping cart and then into my van. Strength means independence for older women."

"I have said all along that Trump could win, and some polls show him ahead today.

Your remark that polls showed Carter ahead can work both ways. If polling shows Trump to be ahead, he still could lose, even by a landslide.  I would hate to see this nation under Trump, who doesn't know jack about governance, and thinks going bankrupt is the way to get ahead, and grabs girls and women by the p@$$y as a way to get acquainted. Maybe he and his buddy Vladimir can fix everything up in the Middle East?  Frankly, I think anyone who admires Trump is a creep, imbecile, or sociopath.  But hey! that's half the whities in Amurca!"
What about the arbitrary refusal to ordain women? That is most certainly NOT about service. THAT is ego.
"Maybe a bit longer than a few decades ago (that was the 80s and fathers were spending more time with kids), but it is a fact that our society has been changing from one where fathers tended to be more distant and less likely to do things that used to be considered ""women's work"" (my grandparents and their parents, for example).  Things have changed and in a lot of families there is a work balance where family/home work is shared.  In my house we split all of the work and we help each other out when needed.  Its not rocket science....we're in this together."
All of those are women's issues which the Republican party has no platform for.

"Lisa may have accomplished a few things in the last six years, but I know with certainty that she did not lift one finger to improve the medical services model (and the provision of other earned benefits) for women veterans at the Anchorage VA Clinic. You may have noticed that her television commercial, during which she proclaims a commitment to helping veterans, does not feature any women veterans. I believe this proves my point.

Lisa Murkowski needs to be un-elected! Alaskans deserve a U.S. Senator who will respond to our inquiries, work for our collective benefit, and champion necessary change. We have seen in the last few years that she responds only to the GOP leadership in DC. Their wish is her command. 

Alaskans deserve better than Lisa."
"What does Obama's color have to do with anything ?  He has reduced our country to it's lowest level since Carter . He did that by himself , with Hillary Clinton's help of course. It had nothing to do with him being black or her being a woman. It was all about them both being poor quality leaders with everyone else's problems coming first and America's coming in a distant second . They want us to be just a country equal to everyone else---not the force for good over evil in the world."
"How is that possible ? I would think she would get skin cancer first or vagina cancer then cervix, uterus and ovaries last. This only proves how crazy we are."

"'Trump's America' insofar as sharia law is concerned is Obama's America.  The blame game won't fly on this one.  

As far as religion and Islam goes, it is the law in the U S that no person who intends to practice polygamy is admissible to this country, although the Qur'an permits four wives.

"If human nature could not be changed, we would still have slavery, women would be considered property, and open warfare between nations would be common. The world is guaranteed to change, liberals typically embrace that change, conservatives fight it. The irony of the current election, is that Trump is proposing to blowup and reinvent the world with a flood of crazy outrageous ideas, while Hillary represents continuity and the status quo, usually the conservative's ground. Trump is the radical and bomb thrower in this election."
Said and did are two different things. He was never accused by any woman of grabbing any body parts without permission. LOL
He's 85.  He'll live the rest of his life sleeping on top of a giant pile of cash.  They should have tossed him 25 years ago and saved many women the humiliation of satisfying that fat pig or being fired.
"Just wondering if it has occurred to anyone else that the woman spearheading changes to OUR country's ""democratic reform"" is an illegal alien. 

For that reason, as far as I'm concerned, any proposals regarding to changes to OUR elections is as illegitimate as the government who protects her."

"I, too, have been wondering how wasteful I am of the earth's resources and feel stuck in a bind.  
I want a warm home in winter and a cooled home in summer - I am trying to reduce power consumption by letting temperatures be cooler in winter in warmer in summer - but I can only go so far.  Or, maybe I will only go so far until something forces me.

I am trying to pay attention to how much water I waste - I never did bother for long years.  Can you imagine what it would be like to try to bathe in a few gallons of water and, especially if you are female, to also wash your hair?  Or what it would be like to have to haul the water from a well or empty a tub full of water?  Which reminds me, I have to buy a new hot water heater and the people I have talked to say there really is no recycling of old hot water heaters - they just go to the dump.

And, no, I don't think I can give up my cell phone."

"Science is either out to get you or the Church or you may be the one misunderstanding. Even the Pope bets on science. That world of moral superiority being the highest truth? It got deleted. There is no abortion law or homosexuality law, rather their are judicial decisions that precent jmaking such law and support or opposition is meaningless. There is no such thing as doctor mandated suicide. As for global warming, your penance is to write a check to Puerto Rican relief."
"I don't see any reference to ""little lady"".  Is that just a projection on your part?  The accusation of sexism seems really strained here.  I didn't catch any the first time and reading it again looking for it didn't catch any.

Is ""Saucrestress"" the extent of this charge? It's worth noting that traditionally ""mistress"" is the female equivalent of ""master"".  The feminist magazine Ms. uses an abbreviation for ""mistress"".

I get being a bit defensive.  I think the review could have gone into more detail about the differing styles of the pies and whether they were good for the styles. Certainly the review shows a modest preference for Pizza Jerk over Red Sauce. But the charge of sexism seems flimsy at best."

"This is from a collection of lies Breitbart led the way in from the news aggregator Alternate. James O'keefe plays a role in most of them with his intentionally scurrilous editing. Sad to see that such a disreputable organization could play such a huge role in the trump admin:

3. False 'sting' on Planned Parenthood. Breitbart News was the big player in disseminating the demonstrably false narrative that Planned Parenthood sells the body parts of aborted fetuses for profit. No matter that it’s not true: The story, however many times it’s been debunked, has been used as a bludgeon in Congress and state legislatures across the nation as a reason to withhold government funding of Planned Parenthood’s health-care services to poor and working-class women."
"Who knows. Washington is a cesspool of rapists and crime like most large US cities. Thanks to the panty-waist-in -chief's failure to address the problem of urban crime, America's cities have remained a festering cauldron of discontent, crime, murder, gun violence, and last but not least, sexual assault. against women. Be careful, women. You just never know."
"The business meeting with our Douglas County Commissioners last night was very informative with an overload of good will, but the tension in the air somehow reminds me of the story about Solomon and the two women claiming the baby was theirs.  Everyone knows the rest of the story and it seems only fitting now that someone should have the wisdom to declare that we cut this Justice Center Tax Fund in half.  
I would like to provide a different perspective on what I heard last night.
First, I would like to thank the woman who burned down the original Justice Center providing the inspiration to replace it with something much better.
Second, I would like to thank the retailers for their commercial success to pay for the lavish Sheriff facilities we have today.
Third, I would like to thank the voters who in 1995 reacted to fix a broken Justice Center, but I wouldn't accredit them as visionaries.  They passed a sales tax they thought to be sufficient.
But now we have a new fire in town, I-25."

  it's become almost common, they need a chess master/ pro negotiator. .if you can think 5 moves ahead, maybe you can set things up in your favor and slant them your way. a negotiator who can empathize, paraphrase what she/he thinks is being said by the stressed person, and ask questions like you really care.

It's only 50-50 where that would benefit women. In all the other areas where women occupy more than 50% of the seats there is absolutely not talk at all about gender equality/equity/balance.
"In this particular case, the trial judge was given evidence of two points in time. At one point, the woman is, while obviously drunk, coherent enough to argue with her friends and call a cab; at that point, it appears that she was able to consent to sex. Eleven minutes later she is unconscious and unable to consent to anything. Obviously, she reached the point of incapacity at some time during those eleven minutes, but there is no evidence as to when."
"Nobody had anything against a woman president, just that woman. And, why should people vote for someone to be the first woman president if that person does not have the credibility to hold that high office. I am not saying that Trump is any better so here we are. I hope that the third parties will take a leading roll in the next presidential election.

However, the nation should have a 90 day campaign before local, state, and national elections, have publicly funded campaigns, dump the electoral college, and allow only $150 per person limit on donations, excluding corporations, and finally disallow lobbyists from donating as well."
"Frankly I find this editorial to be profoundly misleading.

To credit the national March actions of 4-5 million women the day after inauguration as a ""catholic response"" to Trump is ridiculous.

To identify the efforts of members of the 6000 Indivisible groups in the last year in terms of their very varied political resistance as a catholic deal is also ridiculous.

To identify the efforts of folks who rushed to those airports or marched in all those subsequent marches nationwide in this last year as a catholic response is equally ridiculous.

I don't know what planet you guys are operating on...but for those of us involved in these matters I can definitely assure it was NOT a catholic deal....yes there were a few Catholics involved...but please remember who both supported and voted for Trump.

And one speech by McElroy, while good...in no way at all constitutes major public response.

I get very tired of the Church claiming credit when it was so palpably missing.I was there..were you?"

"ctnd

I suggest the pro-choice side accept the legitimacy of ethical concerns, but argue on two fronts: 

1. that the foetus only becomes a person at some time in the process of gestation, and that we can set a reasonable time period to that before which abortion is not murder; 

and 

2. that forced pregnancy and childbirth are extremely painful and damaging experiences both mentally, emotionally and physically, akin to torture, and therefore should be considered as akin to a situation of  self-defence which justifies abortion. Few people would expect someone to submit to torture in order to save someone else's life, so no one should expect a woman to submit to forced pregnancy and childbirth, even to save the life of someone not yet born."
This is the woman who after killing her baby was found having sex in a car. A long list of arrests for drugs and more. She was in no way able to take care of a kid. When she found out she was pregnant she should have gotten a free abortion.

"Wyatt, it's not that simple. Abuse is a very broad term, it can be verbal, psychical, or emotional. If someone calls the cops or wants to put someone in jail they can use any of the above terms to build a case against another person they reside with. Once the accusation is made, the damage is done. It is then up to the accused to prove their innocence, which is hard, because people associate someone charged with DV as a wife beater already and assume guilt like as in this Iditarod case. The mere assumption is enough to ruin someone's life.

Traditionally, we associate domestic abusers with someone that beats their wife, and we get all of these awful images associated with the thought, but we don't know the real story. We don't know how the girl treated him, if she hit him and abused him, and he stayed in the relationship until he just snapped and wanted her gone. I'm not blaming the victim, I want to know the whole story about this relationship before casting judgement on him."
"Yup, I see Christina Hoff Sommers and others like her as real feminists. She is reviled by organized feminism though."
"And I am offended by living in a society where children can be ""lawfully"" murdered in the womb on the say so of a woman and her doctor."
"I agree.  This is a major flaw in our criminal justice system -- the ""victim"" decides if a crime has been committed.  There are many unanswered questions about the definition of ""sexual assault"" or ""sexual harassment"" with which I would love to challenge the Supreme Court, but in this limited space, here's something to consider:
If my barber (female) rubs her breasts on my upper arm while she is cutting my hair, has a crime been committed?"
"This story made me sick. Eight women in a cell? From the sheriff to the cook, they all carry a moral responsibility to ensure inmate safety, sanitary cells, safe plumbing, legal access, time out of cell, and decent food. This warehousing of people like cattle without regard to accountability is the dark side of incarceration residents don't want to see or openly discuss. It becomes ""a budgetary issue"" that results in hiring HS graduates to work with the mentally ill, addictions, and anti-social behavior. Rehabilitation? Nope, it's the inmates problem.

"SD, I think you are smart and perceptive.  Of course educated woman should be less susceptible to making the choices that lead to domestic violence.  Yes, the violent stranger on the street can hurt any of us.  But, an educated woman should have learned and had access to the information necessary to make informed choices relative to appropriate and productive responses when faced with potential violence.   

If you care about women, you must grant them personal responsibility and accountability as those attributes are the only ones that can end abuse."
"The AUSCP has never taken a formal stand on women's ordination, but many (I would bet most) of their members do support it. But that's beside the point. 

The larger point is that you can't make accurate judgments about the individual members of any group based on that group's corporate stance. This isn't about the AUSCP per se. It's about the inadvisability of jumping to conclusions."
"Well, I can only tell you how I feel, John. I am pro life in All situations. I don't believe in abortion or capital punishment. As a Catholic we have to defend the most vulnerable in our societies. Women can be the most vulnerable in some situations and we have to defend them at any cost. The answer can never be death to a child. There is always a better way."
"We are not asking for permission to stay out late.  We are asking the family to stop arbitrarily discriminating against women. That is on a whole different level.

You support sexism. You claim that this sexism is ordained by God. You sound exactly like those racist creatures (err, preachers) who claim that God ordained that blacks are inferior to whites. And I mean EXACTLY. You have the same sort of bogus scriptural backing and the same bogus idea that God supports your racism/sexism, as well as the same self-righteous antagonism to those who oppose your opinion."

Ann Loades is not the author. She is the editor. She did not write the chapter with the footnote of the speech that you prefer to pretend is not real.

"Before you do that IDIOT and DISRESPECT thing, supposedly this is ALL for blacks killed by Police. THINK about the FACTS that ALL but ONE ( that officer sentenced to life in prison ), were killed while in the commission of yet ANOTHER FELONY, ALL RESISTED arrests, NONE HAD THEIR hands up, NONE NONE NONE, ONLY ONE had fewer that EIGHT prior FELONY CONVICTIONS, including the PUNK THUG in La. who was convicted of RAPING THIRTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL. Think of those FACTS."
"The expression ""cr@zy like bat shi!"" is used a lot to describe Trump but it can also be used to describe Wynne.
Just the thought of reducing the  grid’s reliance on natural-gas generation with a good possibility of forcing all new builds to be fully reliant on electricity for heating and other needs such as cooking put her in that same category as Trump.  She really has to go before any further damage is done.  
Besides getting rid of natural gas is closing all the nuclear plants in Ontario another one of her long range goals?"

"I've practiced Islam for a few years, and while I no longer follow their teachings I'd like to share my opinion on the issue.

The Quran asks only for modesty on the part of woman in Islam. I'm not even sure if the 'hijab' is even mentioned in the book. How 'modest' is modest is partly up for debate: Jordan has adopted western values, and there's a decent number of Muslim woman who don't wear hijabs.

Yes, there's some that wear hijabs by choice, and that's fine. However, we can't really see behind closed doors so whose to say she wears one because she wants to or because of the fear of being shunned by a traditional Muslim family? 

I know my mother is still seen as an outcast by other family members, the ""black sheep"", when she abandoned her headscarf a decade ago. She doesn't mind it though, and loves being complimented. She still practices Islam, but I've only ever heard her complain about western society's cold weather, parking tickets, and electricity bills."

"It has been my experience that despite the overt placing of women in the cabinet. ""this is 2016"" Canada is even more sexist as a country than the US. My experience growing up in Canada. I sat in the engineering classes where I was the only female student, McGill and Ottawa U. I listened to the comments. I had to leave Canada to even get an education. I have said this over and over. My mother said this over and over that women are denigrated to second class. My great-aunt who graduated from McGill in medicine in the '30's had to quit her job when she got married. And she worked with Wilder Penfield.I am tired of being treated like the alien from space because I am good at math. I can't get hired in this country. So Canada quit justifying the sexism and get with the program."

"You have conflated my remarks.  

I did not equate Deady and Lincoln's beliefs.  

It is hardly surprising or new information that what was required to get Oregon statehood was what was put into our constitution regarding slavery and negroes.  

The Oregon Blue Book summary on Oregon's Constitutional Convention and Oregon voters:

""Did they want slavery? They voted 7,727 no and 2,645 yes. Did they want freed African-Americans to live in Oregon? They voted eight to one against permitting their residency""

""The question of driving free African-Americans from the new state revealed resoundingly racist attitudes. They did not see freed slaves, Indians, or women standing equally before the law. In this Oregonians differed little from Thomas Jefferson.""

""Oregon would be a free state, yet its newly elected senators--Joseph Lane and Delazon Smith--were proslavery Democrats."""
"The problem with that argument is that there is no law regarding abortion.  Therefore, the Liberals are just as opposed to the ""law of the land"" as she is, as both sides' views in relation to nothing are equally opposite.

Now, if there was actually a law that stated ""all women may get an abortion at any time during a pregnancy without restriction"", then yes, she would be opposite to that.

Because there isn't, the Liberals are imposing their specific narrow viewpoint on a perfectly legal and rational position to hold in the current state of the ACTUAL law.  They are the ones completely in the wrong here."

At this point in time, the preponderance of evidence is that there are biological differences. That doesn't deny that there is a lot of overlap, and it doesn't deny that in the individual, those differences are the only factors to take into consideration.

The author of the ""manifesto"" clearly points this out, but much of the reporting on it has incorrectly portrayed the document as saying ""women can't be software engineers"", as opposed to what it was actually saying, which was ""not all biases are social constructs, and in it's diversity program, Google has been ignoring science, and numbers"" (20% of Google's engineers are women. 18% of graduates in the field are women).

Demore also goes out of his way to point out that there IS sexism in tech workplaces (including Google)."

some as an ex girl friend did not want me working in any formats unless it was Christian.  her right

The fact that the virtue part of the ' virtue signalling' part of the package is picked up on only by the 15% to 18% of people who identify with the listed progressive views, suggests that we are going to end up with a self-reinforcing cabal of folks catapulting themselves onto a political island that is only tenuously connected with mainstream society.  

Maybe some of them should be given a real island to try out their ideas?   Cuba may be open for that.."
"LOL...I was there until there was a discussion about violence (might've been one of the players hitting his girlfriend or wife).  I said Americans take less issue with violence than they do with sex.  A lot jumped on me saying that wasn't true, so I posted a pic of a Broncos cheerleader who was doing a high kick, and you could see her panties.  I got tossed for it.  Point made!  :-D

Again, good to hear from you again.  Ever invest in that NFL Game Pass?  It's a deal, especially if you want to dissect the plays and get a more informed opinion on some of the comments about the players and the plays.

...golfing with an old lady...not even gonna ask....lol..."

"Personally, Women are to emotionally controlled to properly do jobs which require logic and rational thinking. To just put women into positions to satisfy a Women's rights agenda is plain stupid.  As someone already mentioned give the job to the most qualified candidate not the most politically correct candidate."
"This woman wakes up every morning with a blood alcohol level in excess of the .08% which is 'presumed' to be under the influence.

And then she starts drinking."
"Are you confused because you assume the ""moral core"" refers to the morality of adultery vs Trump's comments about ""grabbing a woman in the p***y""?? It isn't.  That used to be a Conservative issue, until it no longer was. Progressives and liberals don't care about adultery,""perversion"", ""lewdness"", etc.,  just about respect and consent.

It is the morality of sexual aggression (grabbing) and general indifference to women's issues, vs a feminist agenda."
You mean like women getting cattle future options that magically turn into million$...while hubby is a governor?
"Good for her, she was brought up well."
"Nobody but you brought up conservative moralty. Which to all non conservatives are better known as 'what pure evil looks like'. It's not conservative morality that prevents rape of women - if anything it enables it. Liberal morality built on affirmative consent, medically accurate sex ed, and the principle of body ownership does reduce it."
"Perhaps...because there was really nothing to tell?

See Nora's comment that she was told the women were treated well...that the stoles were taken only before Mass (and we can understand that, in light of other disruptions at other Masses).  Yes.  Perhaps there really was nothing to tell."
"Nick - I disagree with your premise that republicans are the only ones that are trying to eliminate the vote for women and minorities. There are unethical people on both sides of the aisle. Many elected republicans have worked with democrats to get things done and that is why there is such anger at the ""establishment"" on both sides. I agree that there are some republicans who are in office to further their own agenda, but the same can be said for some democrats as well. 
I do not think that saying that republican/conservative voters are dumb and blind adds anything worthwhile to the debate."
"Actually what Trump has done is give those who read leftist journalism a reason to question the validity of said journalists.  The most recent few weeks has shown the amount of ""spin"" the liberal media takes on anything Trump.  From blasting his preference of golf courses to the first lady's feigned 'hand slap', MSM has shown contempt for even the most inconsequential, unimportant occurrences seeking to 'throw shade' on everything Trump, true or not.  As I indicated to another commenter the MSM has admitted to Trump stories being 89-91% negative.  Knowing this I think the media has more responsibility for reactionary outbursts than the individuals.  It is liberal media that has created the monster not Trump.  Trump has merely exposed it."
"Muslims excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of  Christianity, Europe and America, destructive  iconoclasm, and even Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars of extermination between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects such as  ISIS , Taliban and Al Quada are the root  causes of most of the wars in the world today.  It is worse than anything expressed in the west, even by Trump. When will she examine Islam and make recommendations about how to over come its failures."

"Motley, you are so quick to find contrary evidence on the internet, can you do the same diligence on this piece? For one thing, most people are unaware they are sick with zika. For another thing, the woman in El Salvador would have to get an ultrasound of the fetus near the third trimester to confirm microcephaly. Then she would have to find a way to the US. This story is fake news. Prove otherwise. This story is a total piece of **** for gullible people."
"LW2: Mom and sis violated your trust in a big way.  Not sure you can resume what you had with them.  The others sound like cowards who don't want to side against Mom.  Who knows what your mother told them.  I would report the breech so you can be sure your husband's privacy is protected; chances are this was not the only time they snooped.  Perhaps you are better off without them, until you receive an apology."
Sarah Palin resigned after seeing the bright lights of fame and decided dreary Alaska was beneath her. She also saw the opportunity to cash in while her brand was still hot in rube-ville. Ethics never crossed her mind.
"Instead of fining, punishing and imprisoning millions of people for exercising their right of free speech, couldn't we just put Ann Ravel in jail where she belongs and save a ton of money and effort?

I mean the woman is obviously mentally deficient to the point where she poses a danger to herself and others.  And I am just as qualified to determine such deficiencies as she is to determine what is fake news so it isn't like she can argue the point.  Admittedly, Berkeley is a pretty good place to institutionalize such people, but lately they have been letting too many inmates escape causing rioting in the streets.  Better just to lock her up to be on the safe side."
"I looked at the fake news sites just to see if there was any information on the shooter or his ""partner"" and the fake news was incredible. There were two people from Hawaii (or who claimed to be) in the comment sections of those sites-- seem focused on the filipino woman who was a suspect at the time-- one seemed to know her based on information he provided-- but how can you tell? The sites are well done with professional layout and graphics with photos and video and even fake video news interviews (some identified later as fake, and others identified as mistake based on the person being interviewed giving fake news). I think part of it is people putting their view of reality onto what is happening and drawing conclusions that are not merited. One person who admitted her claims were false was making them so the mainstream media would have to describe this as muslim or antifa and not hide it."
"More women voted for Trump than expected, and now the Left is angry and confused."
"you obviously don't know any women clergy or religious.   I was taught in the university by Sisters of Charity of Leavenworth and most of those women would run rings around 90% of the priest and bishops I've come across over the years.   they are well trained in theology, the arts, pastoral (REAL PASTORAL CARE, not the crap the ""JPII"" priests are dishing out) care, liturgy, you name it.  I also have friends who are ministers in other churches that would do the same.  And guess what, not a single ""Church is Nice"" homily or the ""Jesus is my Boyfriend"" music.   instead they preach the gospel... you know that stuff about feeding the hungry, visiting the sick and imprisoned, healing the sick and suffering, all of those things that Jesus says we will be asked about on the last day."

"Employee religious freedom is constitutional. Employer religious power over employees, not really, no and certainly not on contraception. Sadly, the Little Sisters suit negotiations have not been undertaken in good faith, so we will be seeing if this is reheard and what Gorsuch thinks. Of all eight justices want the case decided by negotiation as to how the insurer can grant coverage without the Nuns saying anything. This is a case where the Nuns need a philosophy lesson on what cooperating with evil really means (letting employees have birth control is not material cooperation if it is the default option. The Nun's stubborness may get their case dismissed if the company comes up with an alternative and seeks summary judgment."
"Wonderful story on a wonderful girl!  Best wishes, Shaye!  And yes, her family is terrific!"

4) Juanita Broaddrick - rape 5 - 12) In a Capitol Hill Blue investigative article, it came out that state troopers in Arkansas knew of at least 7 complaints from women who said Bill Clinton sexually assaulted them 
13)  Carolyn Moffet - sexual assault

19)  Sandra Allen James  rape
20) Christy Zercher, Assaulted"

"I'm trying to think of how to phrase this delicately ...
It is not unknown, to see, in Halifax a person whose evening out is over with some sense of a goal unachieved.  It is not unknown for such persons to be inebriated, and it is not really rare for such a person to be female.  It is not unheard of for persons in that situation to seek to redress their missed goal with whoever presents themselves."

"I was charged last week running on the Coastal Trail I think pretty near this incident by a female moose. Didn't see a calf. The moose just burst out of the thick brush and was right on me, luckily it didn't seem to want to expend too much energy and I sprinted away. It chased me for what felt like 10 seconds. Totally terrifying. I warned people I saw on the trail after that, and completed the loop back to my place via Raspberry rather than return past the agitated moose."
I'll let you break the news to his wife and kids.
"Whew!  You're certainly right about one thing, Monica: sex sells!  I had to scroll forever on this comments section to find our exchange!  Along the way, I passed this gem: ""A theology of human sexuality written by a married person (especially a married woman) would begin with an exploration of human beings as we have evolved to our present status, with special attention to the physiological processes that drive us to seek intimacy and pleasure, as well as the sociological forces that shape the ways in which we are permitted to do so.""  

I agree that scripture and tradition offer no sure solution to questions of sexuality; such concepts were beyond their ken in those long ago days.  I'll have to reread Amoris Laetitia to see if Pope Francis has made any progress in his exposition.  

At the turn of the first millennium, there is myth that a Pope Joan succeeded to the papacy.  At the turn of this millennium would be an ideal time for a second Pope Joan to return."

No one can say the women where inexperienced and didn't know what they were getting into, I am sure they knew the risks.  Alaska takes pro-athletes and very experienced outdoors people all the time (unfortunately) BTW, there was a natural event to blame, if you read the article it rained and the little creek went to a raging river."

"Quite true, utilitas. Also true, however, is that Catholic lay women at Catholic institutions (founded by nuns) are benefiting from the drastic downward swing of religious vocations for women's religious communities. Women religious who were ""pioneers"" are now being replaced by new ""pioneers,"" lay female presidents."
"I love going to the library, and I actually own a book store.  Libraries are a refuge from the blaring catastrophic headlines that we awaken to every morning. 
I once saw a family of new Canadians, my guess Somalian,  applying for library cards, and the mother looked around in amazement and asked '""All these books can be taken home to read?"" and the librarian said,"" Yes, and there are four more floors of books too"", and tears came to the woman's eyes, and I actually teared up too and I'm not that sentimental. 
A pilgrimage to libraries may have more significance  than it seems at first glance , although in Winnipeg  I could do much of it on foot. 
Peace."
I have a daughter and her family who have lived in Kuwait for ten years. They work in a school where all academic classes are taught in English and most of the students are Muslims. There is a very good relationship between the staff and the Muslim majority. I mentioned to my son-in-law that the news we get from the Middle east is mostly negative. He responded by saying that most news they get from the west is also negative. We have to change this so we all understand the other's world better.

And because it's being pointed out to the ""Traditonal SDAs"", sotospeak, they're the ones kicking against the goads; they've been in their comfort zone too long and don't want their zone borders expanded/enlarged/changed. Scared people put up a fight, even when there's absolutely nothing to fight against."
Needle exchange programs. Welfare for moms with unlimited babies.  People applying for benefits driving Escalades parked in human services office parking lots. (Illegal) immigrant legal defense fund. Cleaning up after homeless people downtown.  You mean those lifestyle choices?
"Before I get started there is a lot wrong with HPD. Lets hope they clean out their ranks quickly and keep it that way. Rape is a very serious and long lasting crime upon the victims. A person we rescued more than a year ago is still terrified that she doesn't want to testify even though we know who the people involved are and some of them are employed by hint hint. Granted we snagged about 5 people but there are more on this island that need to go.

Death penalty I believe in it. But there is nothing worse than putting an innocent person to death. I think these people who do these rapes should at least have their *things* removed not sure what to do about females who are involved though. Those who are serial rapists put to death. I've killed a lot of people it doesn't bother me putting scum down. Only one really bothers me but that is because I could see the fear in his eyes. He deserved it. But it left a scar on my soul as a human being."
Its where women want to be taken.....not anymore.
"your reply to @SHB is interesting. I am not far from retiring. Unlike this lady I could retire. I am very careful with my investing. However the resentment of many in the public of hard working MD's is nauseating. I worked till 4am after operating all day yesterday. I started getting calls at 8am today. I do not know what I am worth but I feel I should be paid well . I do not complain about my earnings, but I truly do not believe I am paid enough for the 60-70 hr work weeks. I get more by the hour doing insurance cases, medical legal reports instead of saving lives. Funny.
I never have driven a fancy car or taken really extravagant vacations. I did pay a whack for my childrens education though."
"Yes, mc, current social mores say that holding women responsible for actions is unacceptable (even though a more even handed evaluation would likely prevent some misadventures similar to the situation of  choosing to walk down a safe street to avoid robbery).  This is fine.  This is a choice of society which is justified in various ways.  The point is that we pick and choose when we hold people responsible for their actions.  In the school case, it absolutely is discrimination to differentiate between two equally qualified students solely on the basis of race.  We chose to commit this discrimination because we believe that the greater good is served.  So discrimination can be good as well as bad.  Who knows what is right?  Its a beautiful day out today.  The world turns regardless of the pressing issues of mere humans."
Seventeen intelligence agencies colluded and lied according to the FOX narrative?  At what point does disinformation and slant become aiding a abetting enemies of the USA?  I think we have crossed that line.  Does the FCC do anything other than fine girls for boobs?

Go get 'em GOV girl!!!!"
"While I do not wish to see abortion made illegal, I do wish to see abortions become rare, through support of women who make the choice to keep the child. This means more support for adoption, a living wage, social programs to help the young woman get on her feet and able to support her child, CONTRACEPTION, etc. Unfortunately, I think our bishops have loudly supported only one thing--abortion made illegal so they can go home to their mansions (mine lives in one) and summon their servants with a bell."
"Yes, that stat made me do a double-take as well. (More than 1 in 4 are women.)

It's time we stopped selectively caring about the demographics and just started helping our fellow humans."
"The most salient  fact is that 501c3 Church funds were used to support his child out of wedlock. This is criminal.
More to the point there is a deep hypocrisy. The message of equality by both MLK, and by Malcolm X excluded women and both of their predatory behavior toward woman show this."
"""Such condescension targets women in the global south regularly""


There is a major error and bias in the interpretation of the English language in reports here. The author is literally interpreting the criticism of the number of babies born to families or couples to mean a criticism specifically of women. Obviously more work is needed in the areas of reading comprehension and the meaning of words. I'd put this drastic error in the interpretation of ideas and words at the same level as 10-11 year old children."
I'm a female scientist and I would never want people thinking that I received a prestigious position simply because I am a woman and not because I had worked hard for it.  Awarding someone a research chair simply because they fill a quota will undermine their reputation and that of the Canada Research Chair program.  These decisions must be made based on merit and nothing else.
"You have to admit that the Bible likes women's breasts!

Apparently ""God"" doesn't find them ""dirty"".  

Proverbs 5:19 - [Let her be as] the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always with her love.

Proverbs 5:19  A lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love. 

Song of Solomon 8:10 - I [am] a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.

Song of Solomon 7:1-13  How beautiful are your feet in sandals, O noble daughter! Your rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of a master hand. Your navel is a rounded bowl that never lacks mixed wine. Your belly is a heap of wheat, encircled with lilies. Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle. 

Song of Solomon 4:5 - Thy two breasts [are] like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies.

You might want to read the Bible!"

"IRT Laura Bolles, don’t believe everything you read in this newspaper. Congresswoman Wilson overheard the telephone conversation between President Trump and Mrs. Johnson and put her anti-Trump spin on it by claiming the president was insensitive and handled it badly.  That is her side to the story.  Trump says otherwise, so who do you believe?   It is true that two other people in the vehicle support Ms. Wilson’s version, but I find it strange that their statements about what Trump said were word for word what Congresswoman Wilson said.  I believe it is called “collaborative effort” in a court of law when witnesses get together to agree on what to say rather than to say exactly what they heard.   It discredits their testimony."
"""Except they can't. They can't give total self-gift. They can't say in honesty to God..""I am giving all that you - My God, My Creator - gave me to this other!""

That is what your feelings say. Clearly, you do not know any gays in long-term relationships. I know three such couples, two of whom have been together for over forty years, and the third for over twenty.They are just like heterosexual long-married couples. No, your ignorant prejudiced feelings about gays count for nothing.

""Children are precisely the purpose of marriage.""

That is what your feelings say. Other people disagree. My wife and I did not get married to have children. Oh, children came, and we both love all three of our sons, but they were not why we got married.

No, RD, once again, you are taking your personal feelings and beliefs and insisting that they must apply to everyone else. One size, especially your size, does not fit all. And all you have given us is your own feelings. You have not given us reasons."
Crackdown? What Crackdown? The word spreads more everyday among dog owners about this great dodge. We once overheard a woman telling another how to go about it and how easy it was.

"Thank you Ms.  Ziegler for your letter to Mr. David Smith, Deputy Inspector General of the Department of the Interior.  This is an absolute blessing to many long time observers of Ms. Kitty Simmon's conduct.  You have done a service for the citizen, native Hawaiians, environmentalist and all of those that have been plagued by this woman's conduct for decades.  Kitty Simmons is corrupt, underhanded and an a pawn of the Hawaii Long Line Association, Mr. Jim Cook and Sean Martin.  Ms. Simmons has conducted herself in ways that bring disrespect and humiliation to Wespac and to the employees that have been forced to lie and misrepresent facts in order to support her diabolical schemes.  Kitty Simmons is currently aiding and abetting  the slave trading on the 140 long line boats that are under her jurisdiction.  She receives free fish from the auction and is a despicable person.  Finally, you have arrived.... now you must help free the crews on these slave ships.  Peace be with you."
"Curious as to the regions and reasons why it would be easier to receive native status.  Applications are a federal matter with Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada.

"There are numerous programs which the Guaranteed Annual Income could replace at less cost. Two are mentioned, namely Child benefit,  Ontario Works or the Ontario Disability. The child benefit goes to people with money. Stop that. And so with the Ontario Works if the family has money. Taxpayer money should go only to the poor. Some poor may cheat the same way that many other people cheat but best to pay a few cheaters that miss some poor. 

Now a lot of people are poor  because they cannot find employment. This is not surprising since there has been a tremendous increase in the number of two income families. In 1950 21% of women were in the work force. In 2015 82% of women in the work force.  

I believe this large increase in the workforce was due to a deliberate advertising campaign consisting of articles upon articles about women in the workforce. Few about women at home. The result  -  counterproductive - more workers, smaller salaries and fewer jobs available . Good for business."
"This is kind of off-topic. Animal cruelty is an issue that is not diminished by other issues...and that includes a ""woman's right to choose."" Animal abuse stands on its own as an issue.

"I think that people in the Rust Belt have legitimate concerns.  I read and found JD Vance's Hillbilly Elegy very good.  Another good book about this is The Unwinding.  I also think that many don't have a very expansive worldview and are casually racist.  People keep forgetting I am not some liberal snob.  Some people I grew up with don't have the most enlightened views on women and minorities.  Trump tapped into and appealed to these people's unfounded fears and prejudices.  He didn't give them detailed policy procedures to bring jobs to the Midwest. 

And I am not a fan of the GOP's policies; it annoys me that the GOP keeps pretending this is the 1980s.  However, I think that Trump's election actually sets back reform conservatism.  Trumpism is basically Heritage economics mixed with racial demagoguery and him being an indispensible demigod."
"What makes bishops 'ontologically different' is the laying-on-of-hands of other bishops, successors to the apostles and sacramental agents of the institutional church.  It's somewhat akin to transubstantiation in the context of 'sacred personnel' -- their humanity is but an 'accident,' according to scholastic philosophy,  the 'substance' is the bishops' reconfiguration as 'alter Christus'  through the mandate of the Holy See and the authorized ministry of other bishops.

they could probably do without expensive military grade equipment and high cost overtime for their senior patrolmen and women who are trying to bank out at the highest possible retirement strata but I digress.  Experienced trauma professionals are a better fit for the scenario than paying for vehicles and access for people who may not be a good fit for a traumatic situation; who may be a liability to the department and the city.

"""""Once again, President Trump has shown his conduct is driven not by honor, decency, or national security, but by raw prejudice. This is a dark day for thousands of heroes in our military and for our entire country,"" Pelosi said.

Dear, the military live in a life and death world, in which bad decisions get people killed. Trump's decision is made on the idea that helping people get their heads on straight is not as important as winning without getting killed yourself. For comparison, consider your loyalty to the Catholic church, and how you are OK with hundreds of thousands of lives being lost before they are even born. Who is the heartless one here, Nancy? Have you no shame? The unborn cannot fight back, so you're OK with their deaths? Unnatural woman, you are shameless."
"WASHINGTON (CBSMiami/AP) — Throngs of women from around the nation will converge on Washington for a march the day after Donald Trump’s inauguration.

They’ll arrive driven by a multitude of motivations.

Gay rights, gun control, immigrant rights, equal pay, reproductive freedom, racial justice, worker rights, climate change, support for vaccinations: They all make the list of progressive causes that are attracting people to the Women’s March on Washington and its sister marches across the country and the world this coming Saturday."

"Just as democrats are stuck with the most dishonest and untrustworthy candidate in their history .  I don't recall even one of their high and mighty members  calling for Clinton to quit after it was shown she lied and destroyed evidence over her emails . She broke the law and her inner circle had to take the fifth to protect her and themselves . The FBI , AG and Obama  worked to protect her from being indicted from the crimes she clearly committed . Bill Clinton did more than trash talk---he's done stuff to women from when he was governor , yet the same people screaming outrage now over look that and consider him some sort of God like hero. Talk about a double standard."
Modern Hawaii was built from the hard work and sacrifices of these women.

"The many versions of this bill all have changes to Medicaid funding that would be disastrous for Alaska. Also, Republicans have shown an inability to find consensus between moderates and the very conservative  so if this ""skinny"" repeal moves forward, it is likely to become law, rather than act as a stepping stone to something better (as promised).  This would blow up the individual market place and lead to at least 19 million people losing their insurance.  McCain is correct, we need a return to regular order. As far as Murkowski is concerned, I'm happy she's putting Alaska's concerns ahead of DC's.  Alaskan women are tough as nails, and don't cave to bullying."
"It is notable that the decadent, sensationalist, depraved ""Hollywood"" so much the antithesis of our godly church has taken notice of sexual abuse, harassment and even the lack of access to prominent women roles as ""persons"", producers and directors. Even more ""curiouser"" they seem to be doing something about it. 
Is this evidence of further deterioration of morality and depravity ascribed to them? Or, is even ""Hollywood"", at least somewhat, repentant for its misogyny, sexual utilitarianism and moving towards inclusion and ""peership"" of women and thus centuries ahead of the ""one, holy, catholic and apostolic church""?"

"First of all Trump is not saying anything different from the GOP beginning with the Koch bros in 1973, then Pope John Paul II and his pal Ronald Reagan and the GOP have also been saying ever since JPII got elected. Their litany of long collected grievances is no different. 
Actually, the Catholic church has been manipulating and killing people ever since Fatima, 1917. 
So NO different.
Trump also bought the USCCB by proclaiming punishment for women who get abortions -- their favorite topic. 
Trump made a lot of promises to a lot of different groups. Those groups voted for him based on 'expectations'. Now Trump must live up to all of those promises. Along with his living-up will come much destruction, very likely including another economic crises. Therein will be our economic downfall. 
The Wall St crowd will promulgate/perpetrate another family destroying ( and again against the born and the unborn) Trickle-down mess. So people had better put their money into the best banking system"

"How is having sexual intercourse during a non-fertile part of woman's cycle a ""frustration""? If you want to call a portion of a woman's cycle a ""frustration"" go ahead but it doesn't hold up to reality. Chances are extremely low of procreating but not impossible. No matter how not-open to life a couple might be their intentions cannot alter the fact that they are doing nothing which deliberately stops a sperm from reaching an egg and creating new life.

I'll admit that on the surface the differences are subtle but the differences are also quite real. Again, personal intention while important does NOT determine what a moral act is. What actually happens determines what a moral act is. Dropping atomic bombs on cities is morally repugnant no matter our pure intentions to ""end the war"". Using artificial contraception is an act against an end of sexual intercourse. Having sex during low fertility portions of a woman's cycle is simply having sex. Full stop."

"PS: I just listened to a clip of hillary suggesting that 'the russians' could have hacked in to state elections. get off the funny stuff, will you? you owe it to everyone to educate yourself. maybe you support her because of her sex? then you should revisit her claim to 'running under fire in bosnia'. the woman lies. sigh."
"What's her nationality? What State or state is she from? She really hiking ALONE? Selfie? A girl just died falling off California's highest bridge which is somewhere just north of Lake Tahoe. Now there's a rule NO SELFIE. Why not no bungie jumping, parachuting, etc.? Nobody's gonna listen. These folks are adventurous."
"A very brave Lady, to whom much respect is owed."
"With his words, Trump described acts of felonious sexual assault and bragged about getting away with those acts because he's a ""star.""  Among his other accusers is his first wife, who accused him of raping her; she walked that back to say only that she felt violated by him. Trump is a bully who takes what he wants, especially from women.

However, this all seems moot: Dirty Donald Trump (I've been calling him that since he began prefixing descriptive names to his GOP opponents.  I almost went with Lindsay Graham's suggestion, ""Crazy Donald"", but I liked the alliteration.  I think I chose well, don't you?) will not be president of the United States."
"Yes, it is why I struggle at the moment of casting my ballot in the last Presidential election. I so wanted to see a woman in the White House, but putting another Clinton there just didn't seem to be so wonderful. Next to Trump Hillary was great...but talk about low bars.
I finally voted for Bernie, after waiting until the last minute to make sure my vote wouldn't mess things up. First time I ever wrote anyone in.
I think the elitism is genetic in the system, in that to succeed one (often) needs an expensive education and Democrats are just as likely as Republicans to profit from being part of the investor class. So many of the Dems at the top just don't have much in common with the rest of America. 
One of the first things Clinton did was ""reform"" welfare, and then make sure jobs went away with NAFTA. 
But all in all, the Dems are fighting for poor people. They really are all we have when it comes to fighting Trump and his ""health care"".

"Consuming Marijuana During Pregnancy Does Not Make A Mother Unfit

_At one month, the children of the marijuana users actually had better scores, which the researchers attributed to “the cultural positioning and social and economic characteristics of mothers using marijuana that select for the use of marijuana but also promote neonatal development.”_

I've lived and travelled there, and everything is racialized, women are hidden away, there's no religious or intellectual diversity allowed.

"Every Voter Counts Alliance (it includes groups like Fair Vote Canada) should not scold anyone about ""misleading"". They are very good at it themselves

They claim ranked ballots create false majorities. That is blatantly untrue. The whole point of a ranked ballot is to create a consensus amongst voters such that a majority is not false. Trudeau's 2015 majority would not have been reduced because it was legitimate. Whereas Harper's 2011 majority would have been reduced to minority status because it was not legitimate. The likely result would have been a NDP led majority coalition with the Liberals

And to make claims that studies show that Prop Rep can mean more women will be elected or that voter turnout can be higher is purely hypothetical hype at this point. The Citizens' Assembly in BC used the ""Every vote will count"" and ""more women"" sales pitch for STV in 2005/2009 which of course were absolutely false when looking at Ireland's results where they also use STV."

In the end, Cubans are still poor and downtrodden.  Yes they can read, but what is the point of learning how to read and write when all you can read is government approved propaganda and you can only write things that the government approves.  In the meantime, Castro lived a very nice life - reports have him stashing away millions (kind of like Arafat), enjoying over 22 luxury houses, high speed motorboats and the company of many young and beautiful women.  

Trudeau may have seen him as an kind uncle, but the Trudeau family never really interacted with real Cuban - the fact the Justin is blind to the disgust that many Canadians have towards Castro demonstrates that he lives in a very, very thick bubble.  And that will not work well for him in the future."

This is the legislative learning environment Ms. Gabbard has come from.  I don't know this woman and can't speak to what is going on inside her head.

She did, however, say she would allow abortions where the mother’s life was at stake. (CLC had tipped its hand and said it wouldn’t consider that “abortion.”)

Most popular comedy is offensive and crosses lines of propriety. So the Junos have a choice - make their awards entertaining enough that a genuine audience will tune in, or make it an earnest, bland affairs that will offend nobody but will make the audience turn the channel."
"It s not about how well she can govern the province. Its only about how many gullible, needy, sycophantic  or desperate people she can buy, bribe and lure to vote for her."

"The very name, ""Lepanto Institute,"" lets one know that these self-annoited guardians against ""heretics"" and ""traitors"" believe they are the only thing standing between the RCC and the apocalypse.  Why do I get the image of a bunch of Catholic Dana Carvey's Church Lady?"

"No fear of foreigners, just fear of ""no laws"". Woman have a right to abortions, but my right not to pay for it should be equally protected. The afforable care act is unaffordable. Too many people simply expect things for free now. Steve Bannon is a conservative activist who clearly understands what most Americans are feeling.  Tax returns, sure, but who's going to really understand them? Russian ties? Really? I'm a bit more sympathetic to the thousands of Syrian dead and dislocated for one simple reason: Obama's singular policy obsession of thwarting Russian help to solve the crisis--which Russia ended up doing anyway.  Global warming....just follow the money. A laundering machine for the left. Why is education never about results. And by the way, do the authors have any idea how many Alaskan mothers home-school their kids becuase they can't rely on our teachers? Arts are great. No issue there, unless again I'm taxed to pay for them. FInally, the more talk about Democracy the better!"
"Today, this rape victim has choice to end the unwanted rape  pregnancy.    Alleged rapist & sexual assaulter Donald J. Trump said women who have abortions should be punished.   Mike Pence said that Trump would appoint Supreme Court justices that would likely overturn the abortion law case, Roe v. Wade.  Anyone interested in funding a van to haul rape victims to Canada next year?"
"Denial of abortion to save a woman's life means you will have a dead woman as well as a dead fetus, rather than a dead fetus alone. I keep asking how two deaths is morally superior to one. To date, I have yet to get a coherent answer. Yet if you are going to push the idea that abortion to save a woman's life is immoral, it's one you must answer."
"Support for an abstract ""right"" such as abortion on demand is irrelevant unless one supports the exercise of that ""right"".  The logical extension of supporting a right is that one also supports the exercise of that right.  To say that one is against abortion, while at the same time supporting the ""right"" of a woman to procure an abortion is disingenuous at best."
"So, she is intimidated because her adversary stood behind her. So, to sell a book, she is whipping out the fairer sex card. Big, bully Trump... Yep, sounds she has the strength of character to sit across from Putin, and face ISIS  head on, and fight Congress... yep.. virtually ANYTHING Trump does or does not do.. is far better than if that whiny woman was elected. The World and America dodged a very grave bullet."
"Remember when France appointed a gay ambassador to the Vatican, and how it had to be withdrawn because the Vatican would not accept him?  Any takers for the Vatican expressing as much moral ""conviction"" with Mrs. Gingrich?"
"""So what exactly did he tell Oregon Right To Life in that secret meeting?"" Chelsea doesnt know, so she makes up three scenarios, none of which may be true. A couple of the scenarios don't even accurately reflect the position of Oregon Right to Life.

Meeting with ORTL is hardly a ""shady action."" as ORTL and similar groups nationwide enjoy widespread support. Since when is it wrong or a ""shady action"" to meet with a group representing a significant number of your constituents?

So Buehlet is not doing anything to work on access to abortion. Oregon has more access to abortion than any other state, so maybe Buehlet simply realizes his time is better spent on other issues, rather than come up with laws to give Oregon women what they already have.

Chelsea ultimately is just upset that Buehler is not as radical as Kate Brown, the sexual free spirit who believes every woman should be encouraged to have an abortion, and that the abortion should be fully subsidized by the state."
"Wouldn't if be great if the next time Trump disrespected a woman, we the owners of this republic could say,""you're fired""!

"I'm wondering how they could recognize such sick desires in each other through that site.  Been on that site, and can't imagine one could post something that hints about behavior like this.  Maybe there are some covert phrases that could be used, unrecognizable by the average person.  

Whatever the case, all sites need to police their activities.  Heck, maybe they could use 'Civil'.  LOL.  Those are two sick people.  The lady who acted on this is indeed a ""hero"".  The two who engaged in this are sick and need to be kept out of our civilian society."
If immigrants come in here and don't make enough money to pay income taxes they sure aren't going to be paying for our pensions and health care - or theirs. Currently 1/3 of Canadian income earners do not pay income tax because of our progressive system. An immigrant from the middle east with a non-working wife and four kids who works as a taxi driver is definitely not paying income taxes. To say nothing of a refugee who doesn't speak the language and lives on welfare.

"'Bannon is unlikely to want Trump to force American Catholics to choose between their president and their pope.'  

Dionne is myopic in the extreme.  Yes, Bannon will force this decision while he hides behind Trump. He considers Trump the Grey Ghost.   This is precisely why I think they will use bio/viral attacks to close the borders.  How many of us would say 'yes' to Ebola or some other derivative. I truly can't say I would disagree with closing the borders with a plague overseas. I sure hope the NSA folks are putting some dots together."
"At her core she's a woman who has done her best to work hard for women and families and has succeeded in making life better for them and for people around the world. She's a woman whose college graduation speech was so important she landed in Life magazine at that tender age. And she's a woman strong enough to take on this inevitable revolting blowback from the endemic misogyny and toxic patriarchy that plagues our nation (which Trump very much personifies). It was inevitable that the first female candidate would have to endure this relentless harassment and ridiculous scrutiny and attacks and absolutely ridiculous allegations. I'm glad it's Hillary because she has a spine of titanium. Her detractors are running a campaign based on innuendo and people are so malleable that it actually works (""There are just too many questions surrounding Hillary"" is a common refrain. That's how baseless accusations get results). 

Trump is nothing but a silver spoon recipient; a rapist, a charlatan."
"It isn't ""they"" who are coming for you.  It is global warming, I mean climate change that is going to take out the socialists and the communists, and then the feminists and BLM.  Everyone needs to be panicking right now because no one is safe!  We are all doomed!"
"“The heliocentric model says that we’re spinning at 1,038 mph. They say you won’t notice it because it’s a continual motion. But you should be able to feel it. You shouldn’t be able to function allegedly spinning that fast.”

Most of the EWEB river front property is a contaminated brown field. The clean up must happen before any new construction. That is why it is still undeveloped. Now the City is on the hook for the clean up. That means us tax payers are on the hook too.
"The probability is that most older divorced and remarried couples know that their union is adulterous and would not presume to come up for Holy Communion.
 Since Vatican II almost everyone goes to receive Communion regardless of whether they are in a state of grace or not. Such a situation prompted a bishop or cardinal to marvel (sarcastically, of course) that it was good to see so many members of the congregation in a 'state of grace'.
I imagine that it it could be quite galling to discover that one's EEM  who is distributing  communion or the deacon's wife is actually on the pill and yet you, as a divorced and remarried, cannot receive the Sacrament. This situation is by no means hypothetical, believe me. I did know an EEM who let it slip that she was on the pill.
One can tell from the comments here that younger Catholics, and, sadly some older ones too, have absolutely no understanding of the Catholic doctrine of Eucharist."
"I cannot believe the stupidity of modern education!

My wife studied agriculture in high school in the early 1960's. The course was dropped for what was apparently a more valuable and relevant course of study.

Later the same woman taught Family Studies in an Ontario high school.  The Neanderthals out there will know it as Home Economics. As part of her curriculum she taught budgeting and the in's and out's of  getting a mortgage.  She went so far as to have a local lawyer address her classes on the subject of mortgages.  Amid the present day cry to reach such things as part of the Ontario curriculum, her former class room is today used as a storage space and the Family Studies programme is defunct.

So much for progress."

"OK, let's take your translation: """"First, congratulations that you keep the priest's house in order, freeing him from the material tasks that would absorb a part of his time so necessary to the apostolic tasks, and which are more suitable to you as a charism of women.""

"So proud of our daughter! Her hard work, diligent planning, and teamwork paid off. Such a badass!"
"My unease about most interpretations of Revelation is that they approach the text as a coded discourse, which then makes their task the decoding of the text. But once one starts there, the possibilities multiply. Frequently, the beast is Rome and the number 666 is Nero, etc. The Anchor Bible commentary thinks the work was by John the Baptist. There seem to be no end to solutions, each rather tenuous. Pagels reads the text from her gnostic perspective, which dismisses both John the Evangelist and Paul as presenting a naive faith and champions the Gospel of Thomas as first century. In effect she is trying to rewrite the entire history of the early church by excising the majority of the NT (Paul 12 texts; John 4). With nostalgia she left the church and joined a Gnostic Community in New York, if memory serves. I like Malina because he can read the text as written without trying to decode it. Rather, he sees the Seer actually seeing his visions in the night sky, reading in the tradition."
"Your citation is not an article about people being fired for being gay.

It is about people facing consequences for doing things which publicly contradict the Church’s teachings spun by Michael Sean Winters into something else.

The communion at the funeral was particularly sad because the woman being buried was a devout Catholic and her daughter, and her son, are avowed enemies of the Church who specifically set up the confrontation to make the news.

The issue is one of scandal. Obviously if people - and their orientation is irrelevant - engage in public behavior which makes their employment problematic from the standpoint of teaching Catholic students or being in some other position, they are going to have a problem."

"Ms. Moore's weekly uncivilized tirade is an embarrassment to this paper. It's sad that there are even 20 people that think her name calling is worthy of being considered political discourse.

"It has been a bee in my bonnet since I found out about it in articles in the Post Outlook section and America Magazine just after the turn of the Millennium.  It has been in my book and on my blog post on morality ever since.

So, on the subject, what is your justification for priests avoiding procreative sex with their wives (which we have in the Catholic Church) besides the fact that in ancient times, they could not shower beforehand?  Was it or was it not the fact that congress with a woman rendered a priest impure for the sacrifice?  Be honest.  How can that not be the key question regarding whether sex itself in an impurity aside from procreation?  How is it not the whole tap root for the perversion of morality that comes out of Rome on these issues?

I must have misread the America on anathema, it was Rome that anathemized  non-continence.  Not a point in your favor.  

Pius condemned secret societies in QC, especially the Masons, who were the backbone of Italian nationalism."

"On a weekend.. the Senate committee hearing a tax bill had a public commenting phone-in period.  I watched it on Gavel to Gavel.   There were about 125 callers. 62% of them supported either a progressive income tax or a sales tax to fil the budget gap along with using a portion of the earnings.  But many of those were only supportive if we stopped paying cash and subsidies to the oil companies middle-men thanks to SB21.  It was the end of the regular session I think.   Senator Micciche and Giessel were on the committee. she was the Chair.  I think it was senate finance committee hearing HB115, the tax bill offered up by the administration last session.  I think a majority, though a slim one, of voters, would agree we cannot depend on oil money to pay it all anymore and we need to step up like every other state but one. And I hear they have pretty high property taxes. Sound familiar?  Therefore I disagree that your statement speaks for the ""vast majority"" of voters."
"You're a better Christian than I am right now, Sister, and I thank you for your witness. Perhaps tomorrow I can aspire to your degree of holiness. Right now I'm just an ordinary sinner in need of God's grace."

"Some of these Teamsters may be part of Hillary's ""basket of deplorables"" or Lynn's 'forgotten' Democrats.  

Some of these Teamsters are women; some of them may be part of that 42% of women who voted for Trump that our liberal ivory-tower folks here in university town can't understand.

Many of them drive fossil-fueled diesel trucks in order to support their families which deliver food and other commodities to those of us here in ivory-tower land and throughout the rest of the country.  

Many of them do not have the college degrees that many of our ivory-tower people think are mandatory for intelligent voting.  

What 'technology' do you see replacing all these truck drivers in the next 10-20 years?  The railroads aren't going to do that.  They are stacked and packed already.  

""If you bought it, a truck brought it.""  

They aren't all Teamsters, but ignoring them is a bad idea politically.  

The few I know personally listen to talk radio driving down the freeways and vote!

"The article mentions that Mallory is only paid a $15,000/yr salary as a professional women's soccer player, but she also signed a long term contract with Nike.  How much does that pay?

In the same sports section, I read ""barriers for women are rapidly being torn down.""  I suggest that barriers aren't as big a problem as ratings, which aren't very good for soccer.  Women in tennis and beach volleyball, and of course professional golf, are, for reasons other than the sport, getting more ratings and make more money."
"Ahh yes, Steve Bannon, who runs Beitbart News, with its insightful headlines such as ""Would you rather your child had feminism or cancer?” and “Birth control makes women unattractive and crazy” and the best, ""Suck it Up Buttercups: Dangerous faggot tour teturns to colleges in September.""  If Trump really wanted those people who are fearful of a Trump presidency a chance, shouldn't he give us something to be hopeful for?"
"The pro life movement has no vision and never has had one (I was actually involved in my youth). Its leadership never understood its own era. All movements need inspiration to carry the difficult work forward. In societies that are evolving socially, like ours has been since the '60s, this comes in the form of expansive ideas like ""brown people are just like me,"" or ""gay couples are loving, just like us."" With the abortion issue, no one was able to craft an idea like that. The outrage on behalf of unborn life had no audience. Sympathy, rightly so, lay solely with women because people could picture her and other women understood the experience. This doesn't mean human life has no value, only that the message failed. The best the movement could do right now would be to reduce abortions. Imprisonment of women who got abortions will only result in a backlash. Contraception is as much everyone's right as antibiotics. The clerics don't understand pregnancy."
"NFL, NBA, and NCAA are filled with snowflakes who abuse women, yet they insist on retreating into their own safe spaces.

"Blomberg fails to see the irony of his statement: ""If we have a society that doesn't respect people's individual and community relationships with their God,"" he told CNS, ""then we're not going to have a society that is going to respect their free speech rights, or their freedom of assembly rights, or the rights to equal protection.""
The churches restriction of free speech, assembly, etc is what led to a separation of church and state.  When and where the church had the upper hand, no freedom of speech, etc.  Often pratictioners of such murdered by the a state in collusion and at the behest of the church.
Best for common good of all if religious institution follow the Amish & concentrate on their own practice without forcing it on others as historically.

You like the American Values of 1776 because they still permitted slavery and denied women the right to vote.
The homeless kanakas should take a cue from this fine lady.
"You agree that they used the argument of the inferiority of women. The fact is that they are STILL using that argument, only they aren't honest enough to admit it.

The Fathers most certainly were using the inferiority argument to establish the tradition of not ordaining women. The Didache, a very early document, states in as many words that women cannot be ordained because they are not worthy of it. I can give you all sorts of quotes by various Fathers saying the same thing."
"You're right that people shouldn't judge you by your name, but life's not always fair. For example, a woman who claims to have been sexually assaulted should not be told it was a result of what she was wearing - very true. But, I would tell my daughter to be careful about what she wears because some will think that's a licence to assault. It's just 'playing safe'. Is it fair? Of course not.
You should be willing to change your name in order to appeal to those who have been traumatized. It's not fair, but that's life."
Well she IS pregnant with Track Jr. or Track the II due in October.....lot of things for her to consider I suppose.
i know this girl have for about 15 years now i cant confirm she was sober because she does have a drug history.

"Really high quality of life? Before or after rec weed became legal? Or are you taking credit as so many do in Eugene for the great outdoors as if you somehow discovered or invented it?

All five states you listed have higher high school graduation rates than Oregon. All five have a much lower cost of living. All five have larger black populations than Oregon. Because you mentioned immigrants but didn't stipulate legal or otherwise, we'll assume that law-abiding is fluid in your quality-of-life metric and therefore invalid.

The stumper is fewer ""rights"" for women. Please elaborate."
"I'm pro choice and if there's a health issue with a pregnancy and an abortion is required, that should be covered but after that abortion is really a life choice rather about health.  We don't have enough health care funding in Canada and there are lots of real unfunded health problems.  This would not be at the top of my list.
What's sad about your statement is I can't think of any woman that would prefer a free surgical abortion to the pill, even if they had to pay for it.  I'm not saying they don't exist but I suspect that for them the abortion is the least of their problems."

Well, your publication  of an ignorant comment without knowledge of the type of priest or his actual marital status comes to mind.

Your further theological ignorance regarding celibacy in any priesthood is instructive.

The automatic censorship by Civil Comments of the term used in your post when referring to the woman who cut his hair says something about your general sexist attitude toward women.

"Sounds like the daughter has not grown up. Sounds like she is clinging to the past when she was a stupid teenager, always in conflict with her parents.

"The ""Food Babe"" is controversial for one reason, and one reason only - she's a moron who will say anything, regardless of how ridiculously wrong it is - to sell her products.  For example, this is a woman who once said that air on commercial planes is bad for you to breathe because airlines ""pump in"" 50% nitrogen (which she implied was too much) in the air, which she claimed caused all sorts of bad effects.  Nevermind that the air we breathe at sea level is made up mostly of nitrogen.  She's a scientific moron.  That's why she's controversial.  She's an idiot and a liar.  Her name would more accurately be ""Food Idiot."""

Another commenter is correct, your nobody in radio until you've been fired at least twice.this article and in particular the headline is the definition of click-bait"
"It is even worse than described. Obamacare was designed to successfully self destruct with the proviso that it would be rescued via a European styled single payer national health care program. Liberals think that women should have reproductive choices when it comes to terminating their own offspring and that the use of opioid drugs represents a human right comparable to assisted suicide yet vote to hypocritically prevent an employer or individual from purchasing the health insurance coverage they deem best suitable to maintain the health of their family members, their employees and themselves. This was the reason as to why Donald Trump and republicans were given the DC trifecta they now enjoy. Americans who once enjoyed the plethora of insurance options they previously had, unlike Europeans, are still living and remember what it was like before the premium increases and when they were able to choose their own doctors and surgeons. They will not allow republicans to forget this in 2018."

"Bill Clinton is not running for president. Since when do women get blamed for their husband's infidelity? I am sick to death of this false equivalency between DT bragging about sexually assaulting women and Bill Clintons' affair. What you are doing is perpetuating the rape culture in this country by defending DT. You are also calling all of these women who have been assaulted by DT liars. These women came out on their own, not as part of an agenda. For you to suggest otherwise is to re-victimize them. This has nothing to do with liberal or conservative; it's about common decency, something DT does not possess."

I agree! We should never have had Lingle as governor and she was a woman.  Mazie was a terrible Leutenatn Governeor too. Kim Pine is also a terrible councilman.  She doesn't get anything done for her district cause she's too emotional i think.  Every time on olelo she likes to go on and on about some sob story about her childhoold or her life problems. enough already. she gives good reasons not to ever have her as a leader in government.
"I looked at their Facebook page and what stands out most to me is a couple of harpies harassing them. They gave an answer to explain how their advertising is secured, but that wasn't enough, the harpies had to keep pecking away. I think the woman at Royal Business Systems was probably correct in her perception that your wife was harassing her, if the comments on their Facebook page are an example of how she conducted herself on the phone."
"The sensible centre? The left deserves each other, Canada's growth industries are perpetually offended career activists and public sector unions and both sectors are booming. $30 billion blown every year on Liberal special interests and Trudeau goes after $250 million from small businesses and doctors.  The real job creators responsible for wealth creation are quietly pulling out in favor of jurisdictions that aren't hostile to resource investment. Shell, Total, Petronas, even TransCanada is looking at anywhere but Canada for opportunity because Canada is closed for business and Denis Coderre couldn't be happier. France's Total SA would rather invest in Iran, a country where women must cover their hair under threat of beatings from morality police. 
Trudeau is a champion of short-sighted symbolic puffery void of substance and his base wouldn't have it any other way. Higher taxes and red tape are paralyzing investment and the Liberals call it an ""opportunity"" - for Tides?"

"Marilyn: I believe you are totally right on target when you assert that victims of clergy/sex abuse will suffer all their lives. As someone who was molested by a Catholic priest some fifty five years ago[I am currently sixty seven], I honestly believe that the effects will be with me until the day I die. That does not mean that I have not made plenty of progress over the years. After I was abused , I  attempted to take my own life. I have lived with the thoughts of suicide most of my adult life. For the most part, those thoughts are no longer with me. But I also know that they could return. There are so many effects of what childhood sexual abuse does to a child and then to the adult that child becomes. The way we coped as children become blockades as we grow into adulthood. I withdrew socially as a child and have never been able to make up for that loss .I drank alcoholically for some 17 years.I am convinced that if I had not stopped drinking, I would be dead by now. Therapy helps."
"You are right D. I know that I do not know what the problem is, I really don't have the whole picture and it's just really upsetting all the untapped potential of all these lives lost and the lives not fully fulfilled all throughout our home of Anchorage and our country and the world over. I obviously am overly upset with the news of another death on our streets. I did not intend to hurt anyone, I guess I was feeling I wanted to point out some of the obvious to me that normalizes some of the behaviours that keep our society in this rut of death and pain. Because I singled out Obama Jay z and Hillary doesn't make me racist anti woman or any other thing. It's my freedom of speech. I feel all sides are responsible and I agree each day is an opportunity for all of us to work as if it's a new day. Today was a shitty start to a day to hear this news first thing. I wish we had only good news reported to us, we all know this crap happens every day. Sign me up for the good news edition!"
"oh NO! I'm so sorry to have put you into this situation and make you post that. Forgive her Allah for she does not know what she do. Yikes!
I never thought a devout Christian, especially from a Christian woman that knows how it feels to be persecuted. I've never in the life of me heard of a Christian who talk like that of another Religious sect."
Thanks for this. I hold the continent of Africa in my heart. The story of these female survivors gives much needed hope.
"""And Trump's popularity in Canada?
84% disapproval:""

To be fair, 84% of Canadians probably *actually* believe that Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women.  They'll believe whatever narrative spin is put in front of them."
"Here's the problem with that advocacy. It's against the labeling on the canister and supposedly a federal crime to use it in a manner inconsistent with it's labeling. However, imagine a 7 foot gorilla is bearing down upon a petite woman-a judge could care less if bear spray was used to defend her. Personally, I carry bear spray in my vehicle for varmints of all varieties. If I were in a life threatening scenario-I would NOT wait for APD to come save my life-and that's where I will leave it. Bad dudes abound in the world, and the best medicine for them is the healthy fear of immediate consequences rendered for their felonious and indifferent treatment of their fellow man."

"White people were surprised because they thought black people would go vote against Trump.

Turns out (pun!) they just couldn't be bothered to turn out for Hillary. Cool by me. I did kind of want a woman President, but Trump's going to give me a pretty good tax cut, my employer-provided health insurance is first-rate, everybody in my family is a citizen and the police are always polite and respectful to me. 

So they can laugh if they want. My family and I are going to be fine."
"Let me get this straight; Giessel wants to continue giving millions to the oil companies, is against an income tax because it would affect the riches Alaskans, but would gladly raise the cost of a set of studded snow tires by $75? And this addresses the budget deficit how? Is the woman delusional or isn't that she just has no sense of shame?"
why does this old hag of a writer hate visible minorities? Her columns are reliable for taking cheap shots at marginalised groups. Try attacking the Jews in the same fashion and see what happens.

B) Female = plus minus 52%
C) Working class = who knows? maybe 50% 

A x B x C = 21%, not 50%!"
"LOL

Sure. You know women."
Harper did do this but it was cancelled in the first Liberal budget.   Some people feel that single income households should be financially punished as it might encourage women to leave the workforce.
"I guess the dead woman had a pregnancy that conservatives didn't think needed saving at any cost. I'm sure they will not complain about the cops conducting an abortion by gun shot. Off course, black lives don't matter to the folks that support the police, right or wrong. Don't take my word for it. Read their posts here. they can always rationalize killing black folks, even in the womb. So much for the morality of pro life movement. Most of them support police shootings of unarmed black people. I guess some unborn lives are more or less equal than other lives, in their sense of morality."
"With respect Ms Dlomo, the sudden appointment of a black woman as CEO, after months of silence on their awareness of the fraud, shows their absolute disrespect for ordinary south africans. Oakbay made a representation that R30 million spend on a Sun City wedding was a legitemate business expence. That was a fraudulent misrepresentation. Who in Oakbay made this presentation as it is criminal offence and he/she should have been before the court already. Who in KPMG signed of that these wedding expenses as legitimate business expenses, openly fraudulently? No need for an external investigation to prepare the case. There are more angles to this toffee. KPMG to continue business must save clients and the main object is too demonstrate to these clients that whilst KPMG will take some steps, the important factor is that KPMG will continue to cover client secrets. Also KPMG is making a power show of their flop. Returning R23million fees is nonsense. It was never earned. R40 million is nothing."
This woman must be bipolar. Nothing can explain anything she says or does. Please take your meds go sit in a corner and shut up!
"per past reports,in the 1990's the park targeted females particularly so the young were left alone to die of starvation. The % of animals surviving transport was very low and survivors were moved to just a few areas. The park increased the impacts in those areas. If they had not congregated them in popular places so easily accessed by humans, they would not be thriving in peoples urine. The park totally ignored the impacts of grazing in the alpines that occurred before the park was formed in the late mid thirties and as I remember it was stopped because of it. It takes a long time to grow anything in the alpine regions and I believe we are still seeing the impacts of stock grazing and blaming it all on the goats.Piss on rocks and the ................"
"Icon66, you said that all Christians are responsible for this permissive attitude concerning violence towards women.  Which woman?  The woman in the womb of her mother whom the mother is aborting in a violent way, whom a Christian would speak up for in order to stop the violence against her as the unborn?"
Don't kid yourself. Women are the same everywhere.
"The Bernie or Bust people...the purity patrol riding their high horse on the low road. And just what is it that they hope to accomplish at this point? I'm a lifelong liberal who supported Sanders but I live in the real world...the world in which a Trump presidency would be an extinction level event for American Democracy.  

I couldn't care less about their holier than thou protest. The only thing it accomplishes is it helps Trump. At this point, the Busters don't give a rat's patoody about anything but themselves...ie that woman in the picture with the button...that picture screams ""look at me, look how pure I am"". Each of them are part of a personal identity cult, not a political movement. 

Enter the real world, people. If you think there's no difference between Trump and Clinton then you're not qualified to vote anyway...so go ahead and stay home on election day. Or...vote for Trump...that'll  really show 'em...NOT!"
"I'm sorry for the pain you felt from the abortion, but I disagree with your stance. Women today already go through a lot to get an abortion--travel hundreds of miles, run a gantlet of protesters shouting at them, get invasively probed for imaging, have dangerous anesthesia given, etc. You may think it is an honor to name a zygote, but someone seeking an abortion may think otherwise, and also feel threatened to put the name, and fact of abortion, in the public record, when that may put them in direct harm from radicalized pro-lifers."
I am sure covered women would choose a female dentist.
"""A willfully entertained fantasy"" IS often a daydream, indeed, it could be an accurate definition of such. And in today's pragmatic, bottom-line, metrics-based world, daydreams should be valued, not chased away. 

Do you not day dream intensely and, at times, incessantly about some one or some thing?  

""A willfully entertained fantasy"" is not to be averted or discarded; it is to be cherished. Heck, isn't that LITERALLY what a poem is? Or a love song? Or a love story? Or science fiction?  Or...a day dream? 

Just as its wrong to objectify a woman, it is wrong to objectify a daydream. 

You say I sound new to Catholicism. You sound new to love and romance. (Just as you are wrong, I might be also).  In any case, this might be a great discussion for you and your significant other to have. Without a rule book! And ask her/him what they daydream about you!"
"So when the courage of Justin's convictions gets put to the test, beyond the virtue-signalling and outside of the campaign cycle, the true Justin is revealed and we discover that he is not quite the feminist he purports to be and he is not actually all that outraged as we were led to believe when he was playing his divisive style of identity politics during the election flap about citizenship ceremonies and face coverings.

Now we get the weasel words.

""The Prime Minister was responding in the House of Commons to Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau, who has sharply criticized the Tories for seeking to ban the covering of women's faces when they are swearing a citizenship oath and has accused Mr. Harper of Islamophobia.""

That does not mean “normal” to you and me. It just means here condition now is about the sand as it was before the stroke. The question now becomes, what is her mental condition. 

Worth was receiving $700,000 in salary. Pretty good for a caregiver. She sounds extremely greedy and does have a blotched past in regards to fraud. That leads me to question this marriage. Did the princess show lesbian tendencies before? If not, then I would look at this “marriage” very suspecially."
"When did being a Republican become synonymous with being ""pro life""?   I wish the religious extremists would go start their own political party!  If they left the GOP, it would be better for those in favor of limited government and 2nd Amendment rights.  I'm a female voter, and I shouldn't have to choose between my right to carry and my right to keep politicians out of my Ob-Gyn stuff."
"""Displaced"" as your choice of words, is a nicer way of saying eradicated. Yes some of the 'displaced', mostly women of rape-able age, were integrated into the swarm. Point is, there are no more Bushman to speak of, and the only reason there is a Basotho people, is because they attained the plateau high-ground above the Drakensberg as an impenetrable  defensive position."
Both women mentioned are registered Republicans.
"There is a major outpoint in the stats, supported by the front line police not wanting to expose their lack of successful results. It does take a determined policeman/woman who monitors and records all the events and the success achieved - rare but superb when we see it. One major impact we can all make is participating in community efforts to observe and report events, such as community watch groups. It is our community we care about, so we do need to see this and care for our neighbours and friends.

In terms of crime stats, I expect MAVERICK et al to report more on this subject. The article above is a good view of obfuscation in place. Keep doing the great job you are!"

"Wow Outsider77. Just...wow. So...were you rejected by a specific woman once or have you been unlucky with women your entire life? Your knee-jerk, barely cogent comments about how this is probably the woman's fault lead me to believe you're carrying a pretty big chip on your shoulder. 

Over 90 percent of female homicide victims are killed by someone they know, and 76 percent of these victims were stalked before their deaths. Guns are the most common weapon used in these murders. (http://bit.ly/2bngEqk) Your personal grudge and misogynistic views are a big part of why laws do so little to keep women (and all victims of violence and harassment) safe. 

Why don't you take that chip off your shoulder, tie it to your feet and go jump in the Willamette."

You could be accused of being anti woman or of being Mormonphobic.  I doubt either is true and what is left just sounds a little bitter.  Maybe a kitten for Christmas?"
Almost all abortions are done during the first trimester and in cases of rape as soon as possible such as a few hours or days after. Third trimester abortions are mostly done to save the mother's life in cases where the unborn is fatally deformed and could die in utero poisoning the mother with toxins of decomposition. Late abortions are too risky to the mother's life to be done as a contraceptive measure. Thank goodness OBGYN physicians are expert at making those decisions. This is in response to Concerned Citizen. Please do not place elsewhere as was done with my similar comment to xswzaq.
It's a turned upside down world.  Women used to love being shown extra attention . It was considered by them to be flattering and they liked being told how well they looked and smelled .  Now if you do it you can be sued . What's next---opening a door for a woman will be considered a sexual invitation and grounds for a lawsuit  ?

"Let me offer a bit of anecdotal evidence from my personal network of contacts.

I know a very talented young woman who holds two Masters degrees and one Doctorate, from Western universities.  She recently returned to her home country, where the top SDA leaders are vociferous opponents of WO.  Some of the younger elders have invited her to preach in their churches.  Meanwhile, some of the older elders in those same churches have been openly hostile to her.

The younger elders are quietly encouraging her to persevere.  What nobody is saying openly, is that those older elders cannot last forever.

More than once I have told Adventists from less-educated countries, where educational opportunities are opening-up for the younger generation, that if they want to see what their church will be like in 50 years they should look at the Western church of today."
""" I cannot and will not support Hillary Clinton. She and her husband have their own sorid history of abuse of women.""

"You would do quite well to drop the ""pro-abortion"" term, as I have never met anyone who is ""pro-abortion"", even some women who have undergone the procedure.  So, if you are to ask people to read things in context, first make certain that you place things in their proper context as well, beginning with doing away with the words and terms you use, and as to whether they are made up (by you or others), and whether they represent truth, or whether they are the product of ""overheated"" mind."

"Harry,
Calm down.  From 1865 to the 1950's, the Jim Crow Deep South voted Democrat. Blacks couldn't even vote.  Then Richard Nixon came along with his ""Southern Strategy"" to gain the white vote in the South.  Southern whites were upset over LBJ giving blacks the right to vote and even Truman for integrating the military.  Remember Strom Thurman and the Dixiecrats?
Much like Trump, Nixon appealed to white supremacists and white racists.
So now the base of the Republican Party is mostly Southerners and the base of the Democratic Party is young people (think Bernie supporters), suburban women, and minorities.
Moderate Republicans like Senator Corker are quitting.  Corker is the one who called Trump ""unstable"".

look at maybe 20% of the Newfoundland workforce.  These nomadic people (out of necessity) go to where the work is.  And they make it work.  A compromise for sure but work is very important, as is culture.  Going from Quebec to Alberta can not be easy for
someone middle aged either.  Your life with your wife is not going to end well if her
move and success in her new life will be the reason for your unhappiness.  So either
way, there are decisions to be made.  I think you have made it.  You are already heading back in your heart."
"Except Jay, christian bakers aren't asking if you're divorced. Jesus said a bit about that. There were only two reasons to get a divorce. Incompatibility wasn't one of them.

"Good article, but it makes one think that the the reaction to these events from politicians and the media is a major contributor to the  recurrence of similar events. The goal of the perpetrators is to make worldwide news, and they achieve that, every time.  Would there be any point in killing  innocent people they don't even know and facing almost certain death themselves except for the attention they expect to receive as a result of what they have done? 

And what is Theresa May talking about? What value is there in anything she said?  She is a political opportunist. 

The news reports say the perpetrator in this case was a loner but that 8 people have been arrested. What is the explanation for the apparent contradiction?  

It is also news today that the perpetrator of the threats against Jewish institutions in America and elsewhere is a teenager, a person with no ability or intention to carry through on anything, no doubt just another nut case."

"I hope not.  She's one of those anti-woman women and consistently lies about her voting record, saying she ""didn't realize that was in there"" on just about every issue affecting women.

If Trump caves on amnesty for dreamers he will lose his base.  He used the Angel Moms during the campaign and promised no amnesty and now he wants to talk amnesty?  That's a slap in the face to the Angel Moms and to his base who supported him because of his immigration stand.  Remember that speech in AZ the day he met with the Mexican president.  Is Trump going to turn out to be just like all the other politicians and lie????

"Thanks for calling my paranoia stylish. My lawyer brother Georgetown educated was initially only alarmed when he learned about wireless SM due to home privacy invasion Didja know that a wireless water meter in AR showed up in a police affidavit?

Fiber optics do not use wireless SM that can emit up to 190,000 beacon signals a day coming from electric meters (water too). Natural gas SM not the same type of radio mesh net but did cause serious health issues for a EU woman.

CA PUC found out emission #s that digital meter manufacturers attempted to avoid revealing until court ordered! 10,000 complaints to the CPUC, but damage already done. Do your homework about health hazards. Ive been on conference calls for 4 years, read 1000s of pages, attended lectures, talked to numerous women, and you?

BTW, 100s of others educated themselves to issues involved including but not limited to health, fires, explosions, over billing, surveillance, grid INsecurity as an Israel white paper termed it."
"We don't attend Mass to feel good, hear cool music or relevant sermons. We go to worship God - not one another. If the Church gave the go-ahead on contraception, abortion, homosexuality, divorce, and women's ordination, do you really suppose attendance would increase? And, if it did, so what? 

People are losing faith in Christ and His Church. Ultimately, our salvation is in God's Hands. There are reprobates in every generation. God's grace and the gift of faith in Christ, is freely offered. Not everyone accepts these gifts, or is granted the gift of perseverance in the face of the Church's human failures."

"First, I have an issue with way that Pope Francis chooses to discuss whole swaths of people.  His words are offensive and hurtful.  I doubt that many gay people are lining up to be ""accompanied"" by the Catholic Church after hearing that they are apparently waging a war against marriage.  He could take a traditional stance on marriage and discuss the situation in measured tones rather than hyperbole.  

Second, with ""gender theory,"" we are discussing programs for women's rights.  What is causing Pope Francis vapors are attempts to decrease the wage gap and tell girls that they don't have to be housewives.  I didn't know that this is at all controversial.  Being opposed to professional women is so far out of the mainstream that any conservative backlash should be ignored."
"The diminution of parishes - on the part of the laity - is the evolving sense of community. One can opine that it is in decline or that current realizations no longer meet the need.
On the part of the institution, it is the realization in practice that the Church uses the word ""community"" but either does not understands it; doesn't believe in its own rhetoric, ie is hypocritical; or both. 
Closing churches; consolidating, amalgamating parishes is the ""earthly"" response to an economic model of institution. It is only conceivable in ""the companionship of the followers of Jesus"", if it is moving into a conscious, elevated and more contemporary relevance of the meaning. 
The sense of Pope Francis and of our communities of religious women of our essential interelatedness with each other and with creation is a microscopic beginning...."
"The real questions are as follows: 1. Can a country's assets be won back? Answer: Yes. 2. Can a woman be unraped? Answer: No. None of this country's 57-odd million people are going to be left with a permanent psychological scar once Zuma and his cronies have vacated their seats. Given time and proper leadership, the money stolen can be recovered, or at least the economy can be fixed. How long does it take a real rape victim to get over that very intimate agony? A lifetime? I think it is too easy for some people to create analogies between things that are, at best, incomparable. To compare rape with the state capture thing is, to my mind, sick. Call it what it is - it is enough of a crime on its own. But it certainly cannot ever be equal to robbing a person of his or her most private, intimate property. Once that has been taken, it can never be returned."
You'll be throwing your money away. She has zero chance of winning.
"My question for you ""progressive"" people that believe a woman has the right to do anything she wants with her own body.

Is there any point in development that you would draw the line and say that the fetus is now a baby? A living being that also has the right to make a choice when they are allowed to live long enough to learn what that choice is. Or, because they are helpless and need others to survive, do they not matter?  I guess when you get old and depend on someone else to survive, the same will apply to you?"
"Dear Sister, you speak from imagination or from rumors. SDA ARE NOT ”members of the ecumenical organization”. And to meet and discuss things with any people does not mean ”looking or acting as if we agree with what is being said”. I cannot agree with the isolationist vision that many SDA seem to idealize. We must mix with any people. And Yes, tell the message, but this is not an automatic or obsessive-compulsive action. It is inappropriate and rude for me to overhelm someone with my religious message, before being assured of his or her interest, or before being friends somehow. Do you image yourself shouting apocalyptic warnings in the ears of „poor” Francis? Let such concern with the persons who have been appointed by the Church. Do not worry in vain!"
"Muslims and liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America. Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures across the ME: in just one year Notre Dame in Paris has had three close call bomb threats. They even have Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. It is worse than anything expressed in the west"
"You seem to believe that if you ""quote"" numbers loudly and boldly no one will question you. Please prove your statements on the following: 1- most Whites are murdered by Whites and if you are going to quote  the biased Africa Check numbers don't bother.  2- most white women are murdered by their husbands/boyfriends ditto if you are going to use AC numbers. 3- more black farmworkers are killed in farm attacks than white  farmers (not talking about murders due to spats/ quarrels among workers)."
"you are correct sir, in that I did call it ""kiddie"" porn when it is clearly soft porn.  not my area of expertise I must admit.,  I do know what kiddie porn is because it is always in the story of another caught ped.  I did misspeak. however the pictures are just salacious and this maybe not the best place to display them.  trumps views on women are pretty clear to those who oppose him.  to those who support him - they apparently done't care - even the women he hates so much...+++I believe I owe you an apology for coming to the thought that you were a jerk. your last sentence after the pics were not very clear as to why they got posted.  so MY APOLOGIES TO YOU...and look forward to future conversations..."
"Comment 2 

[continued] how to respond to the Royal Commission’s final report and how to restore trust in the Church.  

The Royal Commission was very critical of the clericalism of the Catholic Church, of the efforts by bishops everywhere to protect the reputation of priests and of the Church with (an utter) disregard for the need to protect children and deal with sexual abusers.  Among many issues raised, there was discussion of the lack of females in decision making/governance roles.   There was also pointed discussion regarding mandatory reporting of information received regarding child sex abuse, including what was/is learned in the confessional.  

The Australian Bishops Conference has also called for a national Plenary Council to be held in 2020:  “It’s clear then that the Church here is passing through a time of deep, painful and permanent change – which is why the bishops have decided for a Plenary Council, [continued]"
"skias3779>  Ige got no say at all!!!!  Federal property so POTUS has every right to visit the Memorial.  I don't ever recalling any women dying on the USS Arizona,  are you lying, misquoting or whatever it is, that's not a true statement, right????"
"I'm afraid it's a chicken or egg situation for most women sports, especially soccer, but also basketball (both college and pro).    There's not enough interest to get ratings, so it doesn't sell advertising, and if it doesn't sell advertising, it doesn't get print media or TV coverage, and without those, there's not enough interest.  In this country, soccer doesn't stand up to the American version of football.  I have a daughter who played soccer from about 8 through high school and is a certified official.  But she's never considered it to be anything more than fun and exercise, because there's no future in it.

I have a mortgage client who is an all time record holder for the University of Kansas Women's basketball (don't recall if it was rebounding or scoring), but she went to Europe to play pro ball for 9 years because the money was better than here."
"cannot believe conway, she will tell lies with a straight face.  don't know why the media wants to interview her, she only tell lies and stupid things.  they should leave her along so she can only talk to herself and lie like hell."
"Harmless may be a wrong term.   A black person will be 'noticed' by some but may not lead to negetive treatment, sometime over over accommodating.   Skin color may trigger all sorts of responses.   As I mentioned before bias affects all ou decisions and bias is not always negative.   Ex. When is the last you were on a Eugene crowd and thought 'there's a white woman' .

Charles knows evey day that he is a racial minority and assumptions are made because of his skin color.  If you and I lived in a community of 80% blacks we'd feel the same thing.  

That doesn't mean every reaction is harmful to either group.   It's goofy to believe that people are color blind."
"Women have to cover their heads in Saudi Arabia?

"""are filled with jealousy because you're gradually falling behind women""

"I agree, this was the equivalent of stacking 220 on a flat bench to a kid who can only do 165.  Forcing the body to do something one time by force is not gaining anything.  That coach is lucky he didn't rip the groin muscles out of some of those girls.  I can see mild force to cause a mild stretch, that was forcing someone flat who had no ability to do so.  Pathetic."
"You crack me up with your clever deflections that anyone can see through. ""Very few black women are impregnated by whites."" What are you, an effing ignoramus?  And furthermore, are you saying that overall, white people don't murder? Think that one over. Don't lay anymore turds on this site, please! I'm beginning to think you're not too bright my friend!"

"I do like it when you have the bells to give an honest answer, even if you feign irritation.  But the Presidents sobriety isn't the only thing I like.  At the top of the list, he isn't Hillary.  He is resolute, he does not want to fundamentally change America, he doesn't bow to his equals, he is working to undo things that hurt our economy, he wants to keep us safe, he chose Gorsuch for supreme court, he wants us to say Merry Christmas.  He is not a racist or a bigot or someone who want to feel women or a Nazi.  Those junk is the narrative of losers who are frustrated that their agenda has been halted."
"The paragraph 

“To me it’s a prayer,” said Lara Neri, an artist and Byzantine Catholic from Dallas. “It’s probably the most intense prayer that I do.” But experts in the U.S. say the broad interest is often welcomed.

Occurs twice in the story. Editor, fix this."
"I am grateful that Dr. Schill is taking racism, in all it's mutations, seriously. I got my degree from the UO despite the daily racism I experienced there. After 150 years, it is about time. The folks complaining about PC just want their white privilege. They are proud in their ignorance of American history. They don't want to know how they benefit from white racism daily. I would pity them if they didn't think killing black folks will make their lives better. All I want is equal protection under the law. White racism makes that goal impossible. It is more than a little ironic that the lady in black face is a law professor. You can't make this stuff up."
It's completely unethical but I could overlook it just this once so this woman doesn't ever bring another child into the world.
"The overwhelming reason women seek abortion is unplanned pregnancy.  The way to effectively reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancy is through the provision of effective contraceptives.  And that doesn't include condoms, which don't do much to reduce the incidence of unplanned pregnancy.

Back in the 1970's there was almost unanimous agreement between Republicans and Democrats that the provision of contraceptives to poor women was a matter of public health.  We also went through decades of states slowly mandating contraceptives in health insurance - a real recognition of the importance of contraceptives to women being better able to plan their lives so the family can better thrive.

There is also the matter of contraceptives and sterilization being life saving for woman who are told either to delay a pregnancy or not to have another pregnancy  in order to protect her own life or health.  

Yes.  Not including contraceptives in health insurance blocks access to them and even kills."
"I don't think that children can understand their parents until they are in the same position as their parents were at any given time.  There are adults whom I know who have never tried to understand their parents (either one of them), preferring to either keep them, untouchable, on a pedestal, or kicking them to the curb, in scorn.  
I think that those who oppose equality for women do their best to portray women as two-dimensional entities.  They see no contradiction in requiring women to stay home with their children full-time, but at the same time to blame women for all and any shortcomings or harm that befall their children.  Women are supposed to be perpetually perfectly turned-out, smiling, and grateful for everything -- even abuse."
"Just a couple of questions:

1. Why does Wonder Woman put her arm out to deflect a bullet that is obviously going to miss her?

2. If the island of Themyscira is all-female, how did they reproduce?

BTW, ""filmmaker"" is missplelled."
"Low fat during pregnancy is not a good idea. Fat is great for brain development because the brain is mostly fat. Studies have shown that a low fat diet during pregnancy can lead to post partum depression because of the body taking it from the mothe's brain to give to the baby. I eat only wild game and grass fed sources of fat. Luckily, I was able to keep down food like this thanks to pot and I believe that helped keep me from getting post partum depression. A lot of women end up on harsh anti depressants while nursing because of ppd and that's legal, socially acceptable because the pharmaceutical companies and doctors make money. I couldn't hold down fish oil until late pregnancy but once I could I took krill oil. I recommend you read a little about ppd and hg. You'll find you have no idea how impossible eating right can be for some women with hg and how hard hitting ppd can be. There are horror stories about ppd and pharmaceuticals driving women out of their minds. It's no joke."
because as she pointed out: women that are prostitutes are not quite right.
"The Catholic life isn't about race in these terms.

God gave us ""race"".

Our job is to sanctify it, not mute it, not use it to frame our thinking about everything, not use it as part of our ""editorial pattern"", but to sanctify it, with Him Who created it.  The PC crowd, clearly NCR, simply thinks about race in mere 2D. 

God wants us to think of things like race in 3D, seeing the supernatural element in it."
"There is nothing in any of the ""gay wedding cake"" cases that indicate that the gay couple ever wanted anything on it other than what the baker did for straight couples.  There was no discussion on how the cake was to be decorated in either the Masterpiece Cakeshop, or the Sweet Cakes by Melissa cases.  It was simply them finding out that the cake was for a gay wedding, and refusing them right then and there.  Let me put it this way, by asking you this question: if this couple has said, ""Fine, we'll take a straight wedding cake, and just use that for our gay wedding"" do you think that Jack Phillips would have said, ""Fine, I'll bake you one of those.""?  Or do you think that the very fact that one of his cakes was being used for a gay wedding is what he objected to?

The baker is free, for instance, to not stock same-sex wedding toppers.  Not all wedding cakes have cake toppers.  There is no indication that the couple even wanted their cake decorated with a wedding topper."
"It's amusing to me that an intellectual coward such as yourself, *actually* believes that his irrelevant opinion would weigh heavily on my mind.  The difference between you and I is that I can share my opinion wherever I go without fear.  Nobody is ever going to confront me, nobody is ever going to silence me, and I never have to bite my tongue.  

You don't have that luxury.  The cowards are confined to the dark spaces of the internet where they belong.   Where it's safe, with the women and children lol.   Whereas I'm free to travel in and out of this world at will, you are forever stuck in this safe space, utterly terrified that your secret might get out.  When you exit this place, you are forced to put on your mask so as not to reveal your secretly pathetic true identity.   I couldn't live like that.  I'd rather be dead than afraid to speak the truth to people.  I can assure you that whatever you think of me, I definitely pity your life lol."
"In a sane society, or perhaps with a more enlightened parent, this would not have become a criminal case.

The father would have stood in the doorway and had a talk with the boy and the young woman, probably telling her to have no further contact with the boy, and that if she did, this incident would be reported.

The sex was obviously consensual, and not only that, they used condoms. No need to traumatize either of them."
""". . . I think most people who think about it believe there's no relevant difference between those little creatures.""

Then why has infanticide never had any serious traction? They are regarded as ""different"" because the fetus is still attached to its mother. Logic would dictate that if they are the same and a woman is undergoing a late abortion, she may as well deliver and relinquish. And yet late-term abortion candidates don't do this. Why? I can think of lots of reasons and certain ones are straightforward and logical and others are not. 

""Finally, I agree that ""I should think . . . more about why women get abortions in order to figure out how to save human lives."" . . . But this doesn't mean abandoning an appeal to reason.""

My point is, maybe it does. Human motivation is not logical. In order to understand, you need to get inside her head. This is something the pro life movement never does."
"I've had red cattle dogs. I have no use for the woman in the story, but I love the dog in the picture. She, the heeler, deserved better from the humans she encountered. But thirteen years is about tops for a cattle dog.

"Carthusian nuns have for centuries been ordained as deaconesses.  They mainly read the Gospel at Mass and have a few other liturgical duties.  At their ceremony when they become consecrated virgins, they get the deacons' stole and are ordained as deaconesses.  This is an ancient privilege, dating back to the 6th century."

"Since when is telling people to go to the back based on their skin colour not racist? This woman is racist, and the Halifax Pop Explosion is racist for acquiescing. I will not be attending such an event until they publicly apologize for creating a 2-tier citizenship. Getting preferential treatment because of your skin colour is the very definition of racism. It's not ""reverse racism"" to do it to white people; it just regular racism.

Equality is treating every individual as an equal, regardless of race. That's basic human rights, whether Canadian Human Rights Act or Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This woman has violated human rights and basic dignity of humans. Shame on the Halifax Pop Explosion for supporting her."
Yes!  Remember the story about the chimp that mauled a woman's face?  She recently had to get a face transplant surgery.
"Since she and her group of Satanists believe in Satan and the power of Satan/Lucifer and ended their plea with Hail Satan,  their group presumably must believe in God since God put Lucifer in the very place this group of misfits are calling for Satan to rise from.    The fallen Angel Lucifer already lost the coup, the battle, the civil war.   Satan does exist.  Satan exists in Iris Fontana's heart, mind, and soul.  Ironic that protestors who demanded Free Speech for themselves protested against the Catholic's right to express their beliefs."
A Canadian Prime Minister would never physically challenge a women in the parliament because he respects decorum and women.  Many years of hard experience has blunted the impulsiveness of immaturity.

"Nate, you might want to study the case of Brian Banks.  You say that the rape was not alleged.  You are wrong.  The sexual contact was not alleged - all parties admitted to it.  The woman said it was rape, the three players said it wasn't.   I read the police reports as published in the RG in their entirety.  There was no case to file charges.  There was no way the DA could have obtained a conviction.  I have no idea if she was raped.  And neither do you, unless you are her posting under an assumed name.

One suggestion - if you are trying to make a cognizant argument, beginning and ending your post with insults is not helping you achieve that goal."
She has learned that almost every time she opens her mouth she makes things worse or creates another scandal.
"The pretense that the all new concept of independent senators is valid is more than a moot point for discussion. It is blatantly obvious that you do not have to be a card carrying Liberal to be named a so-called independent senator by the Prime Minister but without a doubt you have a much better chance of becoming an alleged independent by being of liberal persuasion. The list of fifteen senators appointed in the past few weeks just happen to be sprinkled ""liberally"" with human rights activists, women's issues experts and social workers. No one is saying that these are not people of integrity and honesty, but their affiliations are most decidedly liberal and not diverse political opinions. Trudeau has found a convenient vehicle to drive the focus of a Senate based on strictly political appointments to one that maintains the Liberal bias. Let the public be reminded that some 2500 or more applicants were screened before the Liberal PM made his ""independent choice""."
It was a bipartisan vote woman...
"It is no longer GAY Pride. We are merely hosts to a festival to which we are just spectators.  The whole affair could now be moved to Exhibition grounds if ""pride"" is all there is. Will they ban drag if it offends feminists . Will they ban black leather if it offends vegans?   I can't imagine BLM will give up domination of Pride without a fight, and certainly not to any group they do not approve of.  They have stolen it and are not going to let it go.  Next Year ought to  be Police Pride to make up for the shame of this year's debacle."
"Ok, what does that have to do with an idiot assaulting a woman and a cop? Is your question relevant to the circumstances and would it change the outcome? It appears that maybe your plainclothes detective mentioned in the article may in fact have been his FTO."

"1. Only from what they write. My gripe with the Pope is that he has allowed a situation to develop over AL whereby it is being interpreted differently by bishops and bishops' conferences throughout the world.
When Pope St John II spoke on the doctrinal matter of women's ordination he did it 'to confirm the brethren in order that no doubt might remain'. Pope Francis has studiously ignored pleas from scholars, priests and even cardinals to remove all doubt about the Exhortation.
2. Of course those posts had everything to do with religion, they were centred mainly on abortion and religious freedom. Hillary's manifesto I concluded was downright anti-Catholic and that the Catholic Church would find him a more sympathetic President than her. I am naturally delighted at this but if you wish to interpret that as gloating and jeering, so be it.
I gave you my answer, if you don't accept it there is not much more I can do about it."

"The Electoral College in the U.S.A. elected Donald J. Trump as president of the U.S.A. despite his flaws. Trump has just been inaugurated as the 45th president of the U.S.A. 

Nevertheless, people are marching against Trump in Washington, DC and in many cities around the world. 

The marchers and protesters won't get Trump removed. What do they think they will accomplish with their marches and protests?

Does anyone think Trump cares or will listen? The protesters might as well beat their heads against the Trump wall.

And where were the one million women marchers and protesters when U.S. Democratic president Bill Clinton was in office exploiting and taking advantage of women? Or how about when the Democrat John F. Kennedy was president cheating on Jackie?

And as one person said, why don't those 1 million women march to protest the treatment of women in the Middle East, in other parts of Africa and  in many Islamic countries around the world?"
"This paper's headlines constantly abuse the word 'indigenous'.

"This is going to be be a precedence setting case. I see no reason why she's being denied an abortion if she's paying for it herself. I think it's a bit communistic and chauvenistic for the justice department to believe they can make reproductive decisions for anyone whether they're citizens or not. If justice prevails, she should be allowed to have the procedure and then be immediately deported."
"Only the artist knows for sure. Since the Eucharistic Prayer I (opposite) encompasses Last Supper, Calvary, and Resurrection, ""dying you destroyed our death, rising you restored our life . . .  eat this bread and drink this cup . . . . until you come in glory"" maybe the illustration reflects all that, including the glory. As for the bread, there is a round bread-colored object between her wrists, below and adjacent to the cup-like object. Maybe next time you are in church take a magnifying glass and peek at it (with permission of course), and let me know? The scene is compatible with the history of Christian art where a Mary is not passive, but rather raising her hand or hands in some way next to the cross (in a few examples I found). Recall that the Magdalene was also at the cross, although of course officially, the illustration would have to be a portrayal of the mother. The illustration is very sophisticated art and I wish I had access to a clear copy of it online and an explanation"
"Feminism branding itself vaguely but changing none of its actual fallacies or female-centric stances. Nothing changes except the new exclamation ""so you're saying you're against humans, too!!?"" 

There are important things that were brought up by feminism, but like anything it has turned into a political railroad to run over any criticism and excuse any hypocrisy.
In many ways feminism has been a hammer that has ""redone"" the room, sure it got some nails in, but it trashed everything else, and with no care of the result. 

It is a large contributor to where we are now."
"What you 'personally' think is indeed a joke.  Reason being, you think that the law as it now stands in Canada, that a woman can abort right up to the day before delivery  protects reproductive 'rights' whereas to kill a baby that has been born for 1 hour is murder.  What a joke.  The lack of logic and shallowness of intellect is appalling.  By the way, Canada is the ONLY Western country without ANY restriction on abortion.  To find another country with such lawlessness on this area of law one would have to go to the Middle East.  Go ahead Globe censors, remove my post."
"Can't speak for the OP but here are some of my issues: 
-it is one of the only credits that is remotely universal / isn't really boutique as EVERYONE who rides transit can benefit.  But we can't have fair... they're taking this money back and giving it to TRULY BOUTIQUE credits elsewhere (daycare; as of yet undefined ""woman-centric"" freebies...)

-it is of real assistance to middle class people but also (and maybe I'm being selfish, feel free to explain how) people who are LESS than middle class.  Again, shuffling it from somewhat universal to more vote-buying.

-it DOES help push people towards transit.  This excuse of a government likes to cite ""evidence"" but cherry picks the one study out of many which supports them.  How about evidence from the oft-loved Europe where better subsidies drive ridership.  As opposed to -for example- the TTC which is the least per capita funded transit in North America and pretending to not understand why ridership is low and dropping..."

"I'm disappointed with both our choices this year, but I do have to wonder why people continue to look at Hillary as some kind of champion for women and children who has made great changes in this world, and who would do great things for our country. Are you referring to the Clinton Foundation and their work? Believe me, as someone who has worked in international development for many years, the Clinton foundation has a horrific reputation on the ground, and I don't know anyone (most of whom are super liberal so this is not a partisan concern) who would work for them. And her corruption is so out in the open now - you really can't deny it. I get the concern over Trump, but for myself the concern is equally there as relates to Clinton. I'm flabbergasted when people believe the allegations against her are because she is a woman. There is way too much proof to view this as some sort of misogynistic conspiracy."
"Let me get this straight - you propose an in-your-face name (which has no particular connection with Oregon) to provoke feminists, whom you call ""rape culture feminist"" (!!) and ""sensitivity cupcakes"" (!!) as an experiment to determine whether they would be offended?

"No date discrepancy that I can see. For the article to cite the 1995 and 2015 minutes to support a position that the 1990 minutes refutes is misleading.

Pardon my lack of precision. When I said that there was no higher authority than a GC Session, I meant no higher authority under God. God is a higher authority, and therefore the Bible trumps a GC Session.

Yes, I would like to see whatever quotes you have, if they are dated after the reorganization of 1901 and/or 1903. Quotes from between 1891 and 1901 don't work.

The WO debate has sounded like the national election process for quite some time given the level of spin on the pro-WO side. For example, Dave Gemmel's article before the 2015 GC Session said that by the 1920's or so we had a certain ratio of women pastors, a level never equaled since. I called the fellow his article was relying upon and asked him if we can identify any churches to which women pastors were assigned, and he confirmed my suspicion that there were none."
"I am woman, went to college, and made it through adulthood so far without being a victim. How? I knew not to create the opportunity, it's that simple. People say don't blame the victim, I get that, but I'm willing to bet $100 that in the majority of these cases of sexual violence, a window of opportunity was left open. ""Alcohol doesn't cause sexual assault, it creates opportunity"" is a perfect example, add weed to that as well. People let their guard down when substances are used to have fun. Whether the victim themselves are using it or not is not the singular factor -- but the environment of where the victim and perpetrator are can influence that so much, and to a degree, makes it so much easier for predator to find and assault his or her victim(s). Seems that Alaskans take more thought in protecting themselves from bears, moose, etc. than they do from sexual crimes. Prevention can be a help to this epidemic. It won't fix the problem, but it will definitely help mitigate it."

Maybe they want to steal our space program info.  oops, they lead us in that and have the only manned space program going.   We pay them to launch and return our astronauts, not the other way around.   Or maybe they relished the thought of having a president who was practical and not morally superior and condescending like Hillary.   And as to their interference, when, what, where, & how, haven't been answered either.  If all they did was expose Hillary to be the crook she and the DNC are they actually deserve a medal, not your contempt.

She called Monica Lewinski a narcissistic loony toon? Oh how traumatic! Lol!! 

That's it? That's the sum of your argument? That's what you're backing up your ridiculous claim with?

Typical Trump fanatic! Lol!! 
Long winded, all blow, and no show."
"Trump bragged about doing the very things of which he has now been accused by nearly a dozen women.

He has promised to sue them all (which of course he will not). But the point is that he has called them all liars and is threatening to civilly sue them in order to punish, if not ruin, them financially; which is tantamount to 'going after them.'

Whether Trump actually 'did' anything is immaterial to the fact that that he believed that doing what he claimed to have done was a cool thing to do.

So, he is going after his accusers; and thought--at age 59--that that which he was then claiming to have done was an impressive thing to do.

Trump's wife naturally believes her husband's denials and therefore believes that all of these women are liars who are out to ruin her husband and his reputation.

Trump's defenders here criticize Hillary Clinton for apparently believing her husband's denials and for going after her husband's accusers; whom she believed to be lying and trying to ruin him."

"It's imperative that all Canadians both Muslim and non-Muslim read this book concerning Islamic reform:

""Heretic  Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now by Ayaan Hirsi Ali""

Go to your local library and borrow it.   It's not a book about bigotry, its a book that dissects Islam explaining why its the way it is and how it must go through a reformation. 

Ayaan Hirsi Ali makes a powerful case that a religious Reformation is the only way to end the terrorism, sectarian warfare, and repression of women and minorities that each year claim thousands of lives throughout the Muslim world. With bracing candor, the brilliant, charismatic, and uncompromising author of the bestselling Infidel and Nomad argues that it is foolish to insist, as our leaders habitually do, that the violent acts of Islamic extremists can be divorced from the religious doctrine that inspires them. Instead we must confront the fact that they are driven by a political ideology embedded in Islam itself.

Fed. MP's must read it."

As well, this women resided in the home, how could she not help and why is she making it sounds like it is all the landladies fault. She is a vile human being and maybe the landlady was scared or bullied by her too. If she knew of the issues and never offered help or to get help she is an  equal part. She has not resided in the trailer in some years and was living in the filth in the house as well.  By her own admission many times over years on social media. Always will be those who believe her lies and then the smart ones who know better."

"Seems if they follwed the rules & notified legislatures that Gorak would be the interim PUC commissioner instead of sneaking him in when the leg. was on break, legislatures would have confirmed Gorak.  The same problem occured in the DOE when they put retired principal & supposedly highly regarded Darrel Galera in charge to hire a new DOE superintendent then Gallera at the last minute resigns from BOE to apply for the superintendent position & later has to withdraw his name?  The final two superintendent candidates are women from the mainland  who have no real connection/experience in Hawaii?  Not one person from Hawaii has teaching, administrative experience & is a strong leader from the DOE who can handle the job?  Someone in the governors office is skroowing up big time. Others mentioned handling the TMT & the Maui hospital transition have also turned into major fiascos that could have been avoided.  What major skroow up will happen next?

I know that people respond differently to trauma & neglect during their childhood & I tend to feel compassion for individuals that find themselves in serious trouble, but honestly, this one I can't feel compassion for. I am of course assuming that he was incarcerated at some point in his life & was given the opportunity to turn his life around. There are people that have had terrible lives & committed serious crimes, but in prison found a new way of life, got sober, & some got God. I'm sorry Benjamin Wilkins that you had a hard life, but it doesn't excuse you from paying the maximum sentence for this crime. I hope you do pay the maximum. Also, I'm not going to brush off as not important what was done to this woman just because she was a junkie and prostitute. It's sad all around. Just so unnecessary."

"Matt, you really don't understand that Alaska's oil industry is ready to collapse.

Are you really against saving the oil workers ?
 
You are shutting down TAPS and using the Permanent fund all up, taxing Alaska to death!  

I love all American Soldiers and have the highest respect for them and those good Americans that support them! 

Most people don't want anymore soilders to die fighting in the middle east! 

If Saudi shuts down our oil companies with this glut and we lose our American oil production then Saudi can later turn off the oil production and charge America what they want and we will go broke, since we will be shut down!

This war! This is what they do to support they way they treat women and others in Saudi Arabia!

Let's drill Alaska so we don't need Saudi oil, I hate any woman mistreatment, don't you Matt! 
 
I am proud of our Soldiers and Alaskan Oil workers, they are both brave, courageous!  Let's drill more now to double the Permanent Fund and make Alaskans wealthy!"

Perhaps SHE is subconsciously exposing or prolonging  her own self-hate, or INtolerance for any differing or opposing views? Ms. Dhingra is a perfect example of perpetuating the sad fact of women putting down other women due to their own insecurities. Someone like Manka Dhingra can never and should not represent our State!"

"Regarding the possibility of the death penalty if convicted of First Degree Murder, special circumstances would be the Federal law, Violence Against Women Act.
Under the Federal Death Penalty, since 1927, a total of 37 people put to death. Of the 37, 3 of the cases were occurred in Alaska, one prisoner was Indian (Native American/Alaska Native for killing his mother in-law. 2 of the cases both prisoners were Black and convicted of murdering a merchant. All 3 were hung. Since 1999, all federal executions have taken place at the federal prison at Terre Haute, Indiana. 
According to the Death Penalty Information Center, ""the defendants in the cases chosen to be prosecuted under the death penalty, have had a racial bias. 
3/4 of the defendants who committed Death Penalty crimes were white, but 78% of those prosecuted under the death penalty were black and 11% were white. 
The federal prosecutor must obtain,in personal writing, permission, from the AGUS before seeking the death penalty."

"I would like to see more females in these positions, but affirmative action is not the solution.  All affirmative action does is focus on meeting quotas instead of hiring the best possible.  A better solution would be to find out why more women are not applying and finding ways to encourage more to apply so if you have more women applying things should move towards a more equal outcome.  Affirmative action has good intentions and is sometimes needed, but should be done as a last resort and there are better ways to increase female participation."

If he was such a good teacher, it's a shame that he did not stick to that task.  His interaction with much of those of the laity who did not accept his pronouncements without question was less than ideal.  
I am glad that you enjoyed the food.  We will be having much of that on Christmas Eve, when we have our traditional supper. :-)"

If it wasn't one thing it would have been another. You were just waiting for someone to knock the chip off. Admit it. You were determined to be offended -- and what a surprise: you were! If people didn't notice Peters' entry line for several hours (likely spent by social media misandrists comparing notes), I wonder if anyone would ever have noticed it without being egged on by vocal, ""interested"" watchers who had at last found something to plain about.  As for your allegation that ""Peters ... had definitely crossed a line,"" since when has a woman been *sincerely* offended by being described as ""hot""? Officially offended, sure. But not deeply and genuinely offended. As for your description of the entrance joke as ""hoary,"" you have a tin ear too."
"Alceste, 

I'm horrified, saddened and angry that Weinstein was able to assault and abuse so many women over the years, with the full complicity of his Hollywood colleagues.  

Have you read the New Yorker story? Ugly and appalling.

The fact is Weinstein is a prominent Hollywood liberal. Questions have to be asked about why his behaviour wasn't exposed earlier, why Clinton and Obama associated with Weinstein (its hard to believe they didn't know anything) and why the Manhattan DA refused to prosecute.  A big part of the story is the conspiracy of silence."

"Interesting, isn't it, how when a dialogue with an anti-feminist proceeds long enough, the chauvinist's argument boils down to wanting to re-make all women into his image of his sainted mother?
We women know that our children, well into their young adult years, still lack the maturity to see their mothers as three dimensional human beings, some psychologically immature folks never arrive there, no matter how old.  As a primary educator of my children, now out of the infant and toddler stage, it is crucial for me to model for them that I am a fallible human being who has relationships and interests outside of being a mother, and that I was not put on earth to meet their every whim.  A curious byproduct of patriarchy is this collective tendency to both demonize and idealize motherhood.  Psychological maturity is to resist this tendency."
"Thank you.  We were hiking in the Olympic National Forest and chatting with a young lady who had a white cane.  Her mom and niece had driven her to the park, but were further back on the trail.

"Y'know, this manifestation of the incessant ""poor, poor, pitiful Christian"" argument overlooks that if a Muslim were questioned during the course of political appointment, questions concerning Row v. Wade would CERTAINLY be emphasized.  The vast majority of us are opposed to abortion-on-demand. This is firmly grounded in Qur'anic doctrine, far more explicitly stated than anything in the bible:

""And kill not your children in fear of poverty--truly Allah will provide for them and for you; indeed their killing is an horrific sin.""--Qur'an 17:3

""And when the girl-baby, buried alive, is asked for what crime she was killed, when the (hidden) records are revealed, and when the sky is stripped away, and when hell is ignited and Paradise brought nigh, a soul will then realize what works it has sent (before).""--Qur'an 81:8-14

The childish complaint ""you liberals aren't as mean to Muslims as you are to us"" doesn't really hold water.  The ""liberal media"" demonizes us far more than Christians."

"Actually Tom, for the record, the church's teaching is officially not to support abortion or all Catholics must agree abortion is immoral and wrong.  I actually do believe it is both immoral and wrong and sin regardless of why a women gets one as certainly it can never be considered a faithful act and so must be a faithless act and therefor sin.  However, our church's teachings do not outright demand we agree on the best way or method to seek abortions end in our world.  Our laws do not outright state that me must believe illegalization of Abortion is the best or even a good way to fight abortion.  Given the facts, this method increases rather than decreases the immorality so I am choosing a different method of fighting against abortion which I have stated previously.  As for our teachings on homosexuality, we do not state to condemn homosexuals themselves or anyone else, including women who have had an abortion.  We are all supposed to forgive each other -that is Christianity 101."

751 Heresy is the obstinate denial or obstinate doubt after the reception of baptism of some truth which is to be believed by divine and Catholic faith; apostasy is the total repudiation of the Christian faith; schism is the refusal of submission to the Supreme Pontiff or of communion with the members of the Church subject to him.

Can you imagine sending over 20 million to help women thru the Clinton Foundation. That's like sending Bonny and Clyde 100.00 for gas money for the getaway car. 20 million to a guy who mugged women and whose wife then blamed the women for her husbands criminal activity. Charles Ortel has spent the last 2 years of his life laying out all the crimes by the Clintons in their charities. Educated at Harvard and not a political bone in his body. 10 years ago laid out the mess General Electric was doing in their bookkeeping practices.

Yes, that is likely true.  But intelligence is not the same has being sensitive to others and possessing good (political) common sense.

""She will learn from her gaffe and will move on.""
Perhaps.  But that is a large assumption.  I made the same assumption repeatedly through the first year or so of the current PM's tenure.  ""Oh, he will learn..."" (on the FN file; on thinking before speaking; on making appropriate choices for cabinet and other positions. Perhaps like the GG.) I'm still waiting. 

Her subsequent speech extolling “tolerance” and “freedom of religion” shows that she is trying to do that.
Not necessarily. All she's trying to do is the ol' back-and-fill, probably in response to a tip from the PM through the PMO, perhaps. That's all."
"Acquit her, then commit her. This womens cheese has slid so far off the cracker she's a danger to herself and to others.

"To clarify my earlier post, my opinion of Tulsi Gabbard should not have gone to Syria and worry about the new administration, is my opinion, rather right or wrong. I do want to say that I applaud and respect Tulsi as an intelligent and courageous woman who works hard for the people of Hawaii. If people want to judge my opinion that's fine, this opinion does not take away the good character of Tulsi. Peace!"
"That is incorrect.

Even at schools who have athletic programs in the red, football brings in the most money out of any of the sports....with the exception of some of the schools that have basketball juggernauts with lousy football (Kansas, Duke, etc.....although FB at Duke has been much better recently).

How can that be?  Well, do the math.  Even in their bad Hawkins/Embree/early MacIntyre years, CU still had over 30,000 a game (even if they didn't stay for the entire game....money was paid for tickets).  No other sport at CU draws 30,000 a game.

CSU, up until recently, had a women's water polo team.  Here was their schedule from 2006.  Don't tell me that they paid for their travel without athletic funds that were largely acquired from football:

"The question of the name Junia/Junias is still a question of scholarly debate.  Much is made of the way the Greeks write the name - whether with an accent or not - but, of course, it is relied upon as a cornerstone for the argument for female ordination.

What is also questioned and NOT resolved is the translation ""of note among the apostles"" or ""esteemed by the apostles"" - again, those arguing for female ordination prefer the former to the latter.

There appears to be no conclusive resolution - just an ongoing discussion."
"In the not-so-long-ago old days, the grownups would have handled this differently. The woman on the bike would have stopped, ripped the foul-mouthed lout a new one in front of his peers and then told him she was headed to the school to report his behavior. The principal would have repeated the message as soon as possible in front of his parents with the warning that if it happened again, he'd be gone from school for a week. In the meantime, he's going to apologize to the younger kids and their parents, and his running buddies are, too. If anyone complains, the suspension begins immediately. Zero tolerance, instant accountability.

Instead, an immature, wise-cracking brat picking on the weakest prey in the middle-school herd -- hey, mom and dad, nice job -- gets an object lesson in modern-day butt-covering from every adult around him. The language he used wasn't the issue until the real cowards got involved."
"Rev. Julia Seymour sounds like a nice person. I thought the same about how Jesus Christ was described in Sunday school. This idealized behavior keeps the people agonizing over morality…and in line! Meanwhile, the rulers, businessmen, politicians and priests who actually control things figured out long ago…if they ignore religious teachings and screw over the people…that “God” (or circumstance) would make them wealthy, powerful and “successful.” With beautiful trophy wives and fine, healthy children (except for inbreeding). And behold: The people will not only work for but die for the rich in their wars for profit, plunder and power. The people will envy the rich and powerful…worship them…elect them to high office without regard to their morality or aptitude…simply for being rich and powerful. And the religions will be right there with the rich and powerful…as they have always been since they learned where the power really lies. It takes an apostate to be moral."
"I don't think you realize how close ISIS came to winning in the ME. If they had overtaken Baghdad and Damascus it would have been game over.
They were completely ruthless and ruled by total terror. This was a war every bit as important as WWII. They simply could not be allowed to take over. Assad is ruthless too, but mostly with those who try to overthrow him. In Damascus women walk around unveiled, they go to school and university. All religions are tolerated. All the Christians in Damascus support Assad. There was no freedom of religion in the part of Aleppo ruled for 4 years by our ""moderate rebels"".
For democracy to work, over 90% of people must agree to follow the rules. It will not work in Arab countries in the foreseeable future because of widespread sectarianism and tribalism.  The best Syria can hope for is a benign dictatorship."
"I saw this movie and it was awesome!  The actress is both a model and a fighter in realty so she looked authentic as goddess and superhero.  I like that she was conflicted once she had to basically pick a side.  She seemed very human and funny at times.  

If she were a superhero who used no violence, unlike every other superhero, we would be hearing, see boys and girls want different things from their role models.  Not this woman - she kicked butt & I am very glad she did.  That doesn't mean that I will try to go out and change the world with violence or magic bracelets & truth lassos.  It means that I know what a superhero movie is about and why people go to them.

I tried to get more of the wonder woman postage stamps and was bummed out to find out you can't get them at all now.  She is so popular she is sold out.  

My husband and 13 year old son both loved this movie as much as me & my 12 year old daughter who takes Karate.  Thank God times are changing especially with the young."
"Mainstream Muslims should be denouncing and distancing themselves from the extremists among them who claim Allah demands that women hide their faces in public, instead of defending them, just as mainstream Christians denounce the white supremacists among them.

"Women bloggers and evangelical 'crisis of authority'
What is Trimorphic Protennoia: Conditioned Consciousness vs Intuitional Consciousness
Unmasking truth is a life-long challenge.
The challenge of consciousness/conscience is necessarily personal to everyone. I'm halfway through the eighties, and only recently i've come to an 'intuitional', deep-self
awakening that speaks to me more strongly than prayers of my culturally 'conditioned' self.

In cultural upbringing, we are clothed in religious persuasions of others
that qualify the public person we are, a multi-color cloth more or less
authentic, which also qualifies our prayer life. The challenge is 'what
prayer truly speaks to our authentic self?' A prayer i learned in
Second-Year Novitiate (1952) has recently returned to me with an inner,
personal meaning it never had before, with respect to processing the
three-step resonant soulfulness of Word/Communication,  Light/Consciousness and Love/Conscience, being, becoming Godlike.

"These attacks on Archbishop Chaput are disgusting and disturbing.
Chaput has alsways had a strong pro immigration and anti death penalty stand. Just because Sean Winters gets his check from the Hiltons does not justify these attacks. Like I said many times before abortion is the modern day eugenics in places like NY, where black infants in the womb of their mother  have less chances to survive to age five than children in Sub Saharan Africa. This is praying that the developing world church, in particular from Africa saves us from NRC Hilton Catholicism."
"Equally repugnant to white Supremacists, Nazis, etc. are BLM and antifa commies. This violent confrontation was a false flag op set up by leftist factions in VA.

It's the same paid rioters (leftists) that have been around for a long time now. These are not protesters with a beef. These are paid anarchists financed generally by George Soros & associates to disrupt society. Soros is a monster and why he is not removed from the stage, I cannot fathom. Emily Jashinsky, the writer of this article sounds like a useful idiot, a self hating white woman who's been poisoned by PC. There is no balance to the content at all. The writer loses credibility when the bias is obvious."
"Hmm. I confess I had to study this for a moment to understand your point. The words in quotes -- are they yours? Or supposed to be mine?

The bit about ""the largest provider of women's healthcare [sic]"" is an obvious red herring. The total amount of services PP provides pales in comparison to the entire rest of the healthcare industry. If you are arguing that we need to make healthcare more available to all, or even just to women, be my guest -- I agree with you. But this fixation with //one particular provider// doesn't help your point.

As for your final note (""Conservatives don't give a fig about their fellow human beings""), it is trivial to find evidence to refute this. To name just a single tiny example, my church donates tons of food and money to the poor every single year, without asking a single thing in return.

In fact, it is SO trivial to refute that maybe it should spur some self-reflection -- i.e., ""why exactly have I convinced myself of this easily disprovable idea?"""
"It's interesting that the two domestic violence-related charges would be dismissed by the state as ""a condition"" of his entry into the Anchorage Veterans Court.  Since entering the Veterans Court seems to be to the defendant's advantage vs. appearing in regular District Court, why would a ""condition"" of entry be dismissal of charges instead of some more stringent requirement?  When the DA says ""I'm not treating his case any different than I would anyone under the same charges or circumstances,"" does that mean-  as a ""condition"" of entry into the Veterans Court- he always dismisses domestic violence charges against drunk veterans who beat women?

According to the Alaska Court System, an eligible veteran must be a resident of Anchorage, Was the defendant a resident of Anchorage when the DA made the deal? Is he now?"
"It is great to hear that there is a special place, pre-maternal home, to provide a safe, healthy place for rural mothers to go to while awaiting birth. In Southeast, lower Southeast, years ago, IHS would provide for transportation from the home village into Ketchikan where IHS had a contract with the local women's shelter to provide for rural women in the last month of pregnancy or who were at high risk. Being in Ketchikan was preferred over being sent to Sitka or Anchorage. All the rural women came from isolated, rural villages located on islands. By having this program the women were able to be close to the hospital and medical services. It helped to prevent from having babies mid-air in air taxis and reduced the need for emergency medivac by helicopter, which endangered all during night time and inclement weather. 
This program is no longer operating, women are sent to Sitka or Anchorage to await the births unless they have family or friends (or can afford a hotel) in Ketchikan."
"This is a matter for lawyers. These girls will have nice fat college funds paid for by the Creswell school district thanks to these two girl-hating administrators.

Some people wouldn't be satisfied with them losing their jobs and the district being sued for big money. I know I wouldn't."
"Most of the time people married to each other (or not have sex,) it is recreational.  What do you call it when your priest masturbates or when your pastor has an affair with a married or single woman.  Yes they are braking their own vows.  However, recreational sex is a profound need for most all adult humans.   It is a source of a bonding for people in love, it is simply relief if they are not in love.  The ideas that the catholic ""positions of dogma"" on sexuality, love, reproduction and family has any validity is what is in real question.  Long standing Deprivation does not lead people closer to God.  It leads to people that are ill!  Certainly this is true of the schizoid personality traits celibacy causes in the truly celebrate clerics. In the non celibate cleric it causes false guilt.  Those that really are celibate and are good people, are good not because of celibacy but inspite of the fact that they are abusing their own needs."

"What an unfortunate ad hominem attack by Nicole Grant. We all have blemishes. If Nicole is dragging this race into the mud then here are some factual, background questions:

1. Teresa and Nicole are very close personal friends. Is it likely Teresa's campaign knew nothing about this post? If not, why hasn't she condemned it, after the fact/this article?

2. Has Teresa ever done the very hard work of signing up unorganized workers from a non-union workplace into a union? Represented union members' grievances under a collective bargaining agreement? Negotiated a collective bargaining agreement? Organized a strike? Done anything other than elite, high-level, top-down lobbying of corporate Dems? How much of this non-lobbying work has Nicole done, and for how many years?

3. Why is Teresa's campaign paying Christian Sinderman, a politico synonymous with the establishment?

At least Jon Grant worked for a housing justice non-profit, dependent on grassroots organizing and a shoestring budget."

"""Luther was right!"" in so many ways.  The corrupt practices of his day, such as the sale of indulgences, simony and more, evoked a conscientious response, as do current legalisms.  Restriction of Eucharist to those who acknowledge the Pope, barring others who love the Lord and believe in His presence in Holy Communion; mandatory celibacy for economic reasons that can issue in tragedy for those who have given their lives to God's service; denial of the reality of diversity in sexual orientation and gender identity as well as of women's equal call to discipleship; setting barriers to sacraments for those whose marriages have failed but are now blessed with real love in new unions, come to mind. As we pray for Christian unity we might do well to notice that Anglicans, Episcopalians, Methodists, Lutherans et al share liturgy and ministry and communion, thus creating unity, while Romans continue to exclude 'others' due to humanly devised law, contrary to the teaching and witness of Jesus."

It was a party in her OWN HOME, on Halloween.    What happens if someone dresses up as Vladimir Putin next Halloween?  or the KKK?

"Thank you for introducing me to Tina Beattie. An NCR article about her (https://www.ncronline.org/news/faith-parish/theologian-gender-insights-challenge-priesthood-theology) said: 

""She traced Catholic theological dualism on sexuality to the emergence of Aristotelianism in the medieval universities 'in which the copulative relationship between paternal form and maternal matter is the basic building block of creation.'

 “'Inseminating forms acts upon receptive matter in order to bring the world of differentiated bodies into being. This gendered account of the nature of being encompasses all that is, and it has profoundly shaped the western understanding of gender.'

 “'Form is associated with fatherhood, perfection, order, beauty, rationality and therefore with spirit and the divine, while matter is associated with lack, chaos, passivity, materiality and therefore with nature and motherhood.'”

The Aristotle here is from ""De generatione animalis,"" and I have long felt this is crucial."

"A rather confusing and pointless article. Lost somewhere in the diatribe is the fact that global overpopulation is a key contributor to marginalized ecosystems, equatorial desertification and  global warming. A phenomenon not evident in our western world but of critical importance in the developing and third world. Unfortunately foreign aid and NGO intervention has focussed on ""saving lives"" to the neglect of the far deeper issue of managing birth rates. Culturally embedded family sizes used to be restricted by disease or famine - but no more. Thus the result. Never mind religious ( e.g. Catholic ) dogma against birth control. Never mind population growth in isolation - include lifestyle creep whereby the Third World tries to achieve our energy consumption levels and related CO2 emissions. In many cultures treating women as equals is a non-starter but that is perhaps a secondary issue. Instead of our singular focus on fossil fuels we need to include population management as a priority."
And I'm sure when Trudeau went to the women in business meeting at the White House with Ivanka Trump and female CEOs he wasn't trying to influence her father to be more favourable to Canada.

Mancini is parroting Paul Ryan. The WaPo gave Ryan two Pinnochios for the claim that ""community health centers that offer comprehensive women's care, and already outnumber Planned Parenthood clinics by 20 to 1.""

About a third of federally qualified health centers (""community health centers'') in the Rural Health Clinic program aren't required to provide family planning services, or even to accept uninsured or low-income patients. Federally qualified health centers provide fewer family planning services than Planned Parenthood, which mainly serves low-income patients."

"From the tone of the above opinion, it is clear that the civility and such proposed is of the liberal kind.  Teaching civility, tolerance, and respect is fine if it is universal, but the one-sided examples given demonstrate that true civility, tolerance, and respect is not what they have in mind.  Instead of citing anecdotal incidents from the SPLC, the speakers could have used the example of how a UO law professor was crucified for wearing black make up in her own home with no intention of hurting anyone.  But no, the UO-related authors cite Trump and Trump things.  They are hypocrites in my view.  Anyone serious about tolerance, civility, and respect looks to their own failures before focusing on those of others.  Tolerance is not a one-way street.  Tolerance does not only apply to things one agrees with.  When pleas for civility call for universal tolerance, they will have meaning.  Until then, fake news."
"Something easily overlooked is the role of widows in the early Church--they were accorded a high status.

Also, remember that the Eastern Church has its own saints, but they are actually the saints of both East and West for the first thousand years. Hmm, how about Thecla? Tertullian, true to form, didn't like her but she was big with the Byzantines. Virgin, yes, but engaged to be married.

The debate started with me saying the Left does not praise right-wing commentators for their courage in saying things they disagree with, why is that?

I said the Left was defending extreme notions of women's need for modesty as something that had to be ""respected"" when it came from Muslims, and those who followed that requirement were to be ""admired"", while ridiculing and condemning similar concepts in Christianity.

You replied that they did not, they just admired their courage, and then came this exchange, asking ""don't you admire women's courage for wearing the headscarf""?

"Might not need a amendment to the Constitution.  Only for a face covering to be considered indecent - which it clearly is, especially since only women are compelled to wear them (a point you never address).   Or for courts to find the ban reasonable.

Hopefully the many face covering bans we see in European countries will soon find themselves in Canada.  That will be a happy day for everyone, Muslims included.  But for now, this is a good start."

"I think it is important that priests speak up on this issue and other issues that show how much our understanding has changed of rules and concepts of sexuality and of the roles people play, including the roles of women, of laity, and of hierarchies of power.  The world of today is not the same as the world of 500 years ago.  Bishops need to learn - to listen and learn.  The bishop needs to hear what the experience of his priests has told them.  And, we need to hear what is going on on these issues."
"Well then, you and the Black Riders have something in common, hatred of Obama and belief that Obama is a racist. Absurd.

I haven't heard anything about Black Riders, probably because they haven't killed anyone or done anything else to get in the news.

Anyone that survived violence's misery knows that few souls overcome the need for retribution. Neither side survives unscathed. That is why we must isolate leaders that ideolice violence and deny power with our vote.  It is a success factor for continuity of our Republic.

Astute politicians ""joke"" about violence to souls with abused social conditions.  They promote themselves while scavenging social calamity.  

Charles Maurras steered Action Française towards fascism thanks to poor monetary policy. Fascism found fertil economic conditions.

"An interesting proposal, Doc.  Still, money finds loopholes.  I can imagine international university students set up in arranged, ""part-time"" Canadian jobs that pay $10K per year in order to qualify for the ""low"" property tax rate.

The federal and provincial governments need to step up and co-ordinate income tax reporting.  Real estate shouldn't be available to anyone who can't show income and/or ""gift"" money commensurate with purchase prices, and that income taxed in Canada.  Show that Canadian tax is paid on the income required for purchase or pay 20% of the value of the property per year until such evidence is produced.  And, until Canadian income tax evidence is produced, no capital gains exemptions on any sale of the property."
"Being a mother is the hardest job in the world, bar none. New mothers should have every possible support available to them at all times. 
Sadly, we have a government that says the words ""families first"" but when it comes to decision making, all they are interested in is whether the action they take will win them votes, and whether it will cost them money they'd rather funnel to their supporters through tax breaks.
Bottom line, when a mother comes forward saying she's depressed or having a difficult time, she should be met with open arms and undivided attention, despite the cost. Then and only then will we have ""families first"" in this province."

An observant Jewess who lost her faith when she moved to Israel claims that Israel today is not a democracy.  Yet the American media constantly claims Israel to be the only democracy in the Middle East.  She presents a strong case to question this.

Even a sympathetic Israeli"" quoted in article, I would be happy if the Palestinians were prepared to make similar painful compromises"" contends Palestinians need to make more compromise.  The Arab-Israeli War of 1948 needs to be part of the context of the '67 war.

The world's oldest unresolved conflict has been the fratricide between the descendants of Ishmael & Issac, acerbated by religious tribalism.  Humanity is doomed as long as this remains unresolved. Maybe with global warming, it won't be an issue eventually. Keep up the heat!"

So the conclusion is: If you know what's going on and understand the law you'll support this; if you've stored up a decade of hate for ISIS and Muslims and you want to take it all out on Khadr, then you're an irrational, emotional, dangerous hater.

"Great suggestion, Mary. In 2013, Common Ground was described by the Washington Post as ""a loose coalition of religious leaders who defined themselves as pro-life were standing shoulder-to-shoulder with abortion rights advocates. By 'setting aside efforts to outlaw abortion' and instead turning the focus to reducing abortions—through limiting unintended pregnancies and supporting pregnant women—participants hoped to jumpstart a less rancorous discussion that could unite unlikely allies.""

The Common Ground coalition faltered for two reasons: 1. The National Right to Life Committee (which should get an award for driving its own cause into the ground) because they would not accept the compromise of abortion reduction; 2. the failure to include contraception as a cornerstone of abortion reduction—although there were a few isolated victories in that front; and 3. the perception that Obama took the cause on and then walked away. 

Lots to ponder."

Further,  the rapidity with which the Holy See was able to act in extricating him from Washington stands in stark contrast to its ability to act in so many other areas currently under study (married clergy and women deacons, for starters)."

Liberals truly have NO shame. I hope they get crushed in the dinner conversations around Thanksgiving tables this weekend.

"Once again we get the impression that the ONLY ""Catholic value"" that matters is to be anti-abortion.

""I don’t see an equally well-organized commitment to take care of children born into poverty, children of color or children of undocumented parents.""

"The same people that still think it's okay to use other species as commodities are the same that would have acquiesced to slavery, racism and denying women equal rights.

"It is nice to read an article finally that has no overtly political overtones or agenda - and yes, faith certainly involves life in God through Jesus....

Hebrews 11 is something that I have been taught since I was a little girl - we are a people of hope - ""Faith is the realization of what is hoped for and evidence of things not seen.""  The entirety of that chapter binds us to those who came before us - of course, the following two chapters are wonderful, too.  

Yes, ""faith is not just reading off a list of doctrines and giving ascent to those doctrines saying, ""I believe this. I believe, I believe. …"" - but those doctrines and core beliefs certainly give us the foundation to build our relationship and uphold our hope."

"Not everything is about politics.   

It does not seem to me that the women intended any mocking of black persons.   She did not wear the 'mask.' 0f black face we see in film.  I think she's being falsely accused of racism.   

Not denying racism remains a problem and I understand why a race accustomed to being mocked and assaulted would be overtly defensive.   I just think this became a mistake of 'friendly fire' that hit the wrong person."

In terms of Town Halls, meeting with their constituents is part of a legislator's job.  Please continue to contact them and ask for our opportunity to be heard in person!"
"@SykesCharlie on Twitter:

"(Cont).
This assumption is made purely by desire, and definitively not because of facts, education, or historical accuracy.  The Gospel accounts of the Last Supper make no mention of anyone other than Jesus and the 12 Apostles.  While it's true that the Gospels don't specify that only the 12 Apostles were present, the fact that no others are specified for so sacred and auspicious an occasion certainly indicates exactly that.  Read the Gospel accounts again.  ""He sat down with his twelve disciples"" makes it pretty clear.  To assume that there were others, including women, goes against the biblical accounts entirely.  Such an assumption does not draw upon biblical accuracy, historical evidence, nor Sacred Tradition; it is based purely on the desire to promote an agenda which contradicts the Bible, history, and Sacred Tradition."

Had a mentor been alongside me from Day 1, my practice could have improved more quickly.  The anti-educator, anti-native, anti-University tone of these comments is disheartening.  Teachers are committed professionals doing a job they love; it would be nice now and again to have folks give a positive shout-out to the work of a classroom teacher, instead of the usual ill-informed negative comments by the few.  Thank you Cathe' Rhodes.  Thank you mentors--rural and urban--for the work you do.  Alaska's students will perform better because of your work, and teachers will stay.

"Muslims and Liberals excoriate us about Islamophobia, but we should bear in mind Islam's entrenched racism, xenophobia, homophobia, misogyny, anti-Semitism, hatred of Christianity, Europe. Israel, and America. Islam's destructive iconoclasm is destroying historic treasures across the ME: in just one year Notre Dame in Paris has had three close call bomb threats. They even have Islamophobia against each other. Ancient tribal wars between Kurds, Shiite, Sunni, Wahhabi, Druze and other Islamic sects, ISIS , Taliban and Al Qaeda are the root causes of most of the wars and social chaos happening around the world today. So few Muslims have ever come forward to denounce the sins committed by Muslims for islam."

"So was slavery a widely accepted practice - it is in the Bible, probably in the written word of other religions.  The powerlessness of women until the modern era is also present in almost every culture and has been amply written about in religious texts.  More, women are still powerless in many cultures of today.  Nations were ruled by ""divine right"" kings for most of human history until the last few hundred years.

None of this change to new ways of viewing these issues came about without huge protest from the ""status quo"" crowd, those who elevate ""tradition"" over reason. It took the ""badgering"" of those who saw a new way to view these issues, ""badgering"" to overcome the ""wisdom over the ages.""  The Catholic church still battles democracy, the liberation of women, and modern medicine.

I think it is time for us to recognize that God created humans with different ways of experiencing and expressing their sexuality.  We know more today about nature and ourselves that cannot be ignored."
"I do NOT know any of the people involved in this tragic loss of life, nor do I know any of the facts. That will be left to the court of law if there is justice.
However, I do know that in domestic violence relationships, threats of suicide are on the continuum of violence. At the end of the continuum is death by homicide/suicide.  
The perpetrator often uses the threat of killing themselves as a means of power and control.  Think of how many times (too many) that whole families die at the hands of a ""loved one"". 
This young man certainly needs help and needs to be held accountable for his actions. It's too late to help the young woman who lost her life trying to stop him. 
Too many times there are murder/suicides, in this case one person died and one person is still alive. The person who pulled the trigger caused the death of a human being. 
Will there be any justice for the victim ?

"I have a slightly different take. The homeless need their dogs, and these dogs need people, because numerically speaking, they would probably end up dying in a shelter otherwise. However, we need to accept that, just as the homeless are living substandard lives with little care, their dogs are living substandard lives with little care, and so will die earlier and possibly in more tragic ways. This is an example of that. The woman was unable to take adequate care of the dog, couldn't stay out of jail, couldn't articulate a plan to save the dog. Hence, the dog suffers."

How about due process for migrants before you cast them as terrorists? There're good reasons these guys are on the watch list. Every heard of Interpol? These guys are watched worldwide. Sorry, no due to process. Not under these circumstances. Go read the constitution. It is called national security and the government has the right and obligation to keep us safe before tragedy strikes."

"""National Catholic Reporter uses Civil Comments. Please keep your comments on-topic, focus on the issue and avoid personal insults, harassment and abuse.""

Wow, do a lot of the comments in this thread fail this test. Simply mentioning Cardinal Burke works on some people like a Pavlovian bell:

""The danger is that Burke could still use this to push his agenda somehow. For example he could blame the abuse in this case on the feminization of the church and the the lavender mafia. His trad buddies would eat that up.""

""Is this Burke's projection? - ""priests who were feminized..."" as he prances about as a haute couture drag queen! And he is clear about his sexual identity?""

""Burke is neither gentle nor holy. He is, among other things, a blatant homophobe.""

""An important question for ecclesiastical fashionistas is; 'what will ArchBurke were in the tropics of Guam? A cappa magna woven from palm leaves?"""
"This guy is 93. I bet he can't remember what he did 2 min ago then cause a sexual assult. Does he look like he's all there??? I think this women is making it more then it really is.

why do you read an article about ""Girls"" anyway? Probably, you can't deal with a young woman, in this case, Lena Dunham being successfull while you have nothing and being an arrogant homophobic misogynist loser nobody wants to talk to?

as to john doyle, i think you didn't get anything even after having watched all the 5 previous seasons. you are not proving any of your points or opinions, you just claim Dunham or Hannah being ""clueless"" and the show being ""frustrating"" while being clueless yourself. you must know, and you seem not to know it: your opinion and the absolute truth are not the same thing. should probably go study argumentation together with philipjames.

"The Church has been outspoken in its condemnation of the intrinsic evils of abortion and euthanasia.

The Church constantly reminds Catholics that while capital punishment is moral, its use should be rare and carefully weighed.

The Church teaches that defense of self and family is a right and at times a duty.

As long as the means are legal and do not invariably cause death the Church is silent about how that self-defense is accomplished. The Church provides the moral principles, the faithful make prudential judgements.

There is no one in the Catholic Church who is an expert on firearms, which is the province of the faithful."
"Very interesting, though sometimes the history...and the Americanism of that history, can be as beside the point as abstraction or identity categories. In my experience as a white, educated woman aging in place, power and privilege are much more narrowly defined.

If a person subscribes to hierarchies of any kind, they seem to form unconscious assumptions about all the Others who don't quite qualify to have power...and therefore Voice or Agency.  I have no doubt these pecking orders serve capitalsim.  It seems obvious that capitalist values, and sometimes religious ones, keep the hierarchies in place. But the results of categories or race, religion, gender, class, skin colour, educational achievement etc. etc. are that organizing across categories becomes very difficult.
And what about climate change?  It seems to me the Great Mother cares about as much about our endless divisions as radicals should.  Who is speaking for her today? Because she's likely not a Marxist; she is Material."
"The Republican nominee appeared before a rich, mostly white, mostly Republican, mostly Catholic audience  -- and managed to get booed.  On the one hand, this unlikely (in any other year) scenario exposes once again (as MSW rightly says) the boorishness of Donald Trump, his remarkably poor judgment, temperament and timing; on the other hand, the reaction of the audience to his boorishness is reassuring: most people, regardless of politics, religion, or social status, are fundamentally decent and still capable of righteous indignation when face-to-face with someone who isn't.  One would hope -- but unfortunately not expect -- that Catholic clerics, especially bishops, who have been explicitly or implicitly supporting the candidacy of the fascist, racist, xenophobic, misogynistic know-nothing Republican nominee will apologize and stand down."
"Not positive on this but if you built post 1991 then you are not subject to rent controls and can jack up the rent as you see fit....in this case the ladies went up $950 a month....  if this is the case your argument does not hold water and would only apply if you bought an investment/rental property pre-1991, not if you were building anything in the last 26 years."
"There's a certain defiance in this judge's deplorable actions. No woman or any minority could possibly have any faith in a system that excuses this behaviour.  This judge showed exceptionally poor judgment (at best).

"If she is similar to Trudeau New Zealanders can expect a long line of failures:
- reconciliation with First Nations.
- inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women
- new voting system before the next elections
- a budget that balances itself
- support for NAFTA (the position of Justin is NOT free trade but government managed trade - god help the little guy)
- an open and transparent government (rated less open than Harper)
- a fair and open competition to replace the CF 18s, combined with the promise not to buy the F35s, to do one or the other will be a lie since they are contradictory
- the increase in the tax rate on high income earners will pay for the tax cut to the middle class (even the Liberals now admit it won't)
-  the ""tax cut"" for the middle class has been taken away, and more, by increases in payroll taxes i.e CPP a plus the new carbon tax.
All I have to say is ""Good Luck our southern friends""."
"Oregon: Of course it's a defunct justice system. For one, you  vote Liberal, invest millions in social services and have little hippy communities that only serve as cesspools for creeps like this. Funny I hear time and time again about Red States supposed anti-woman policies while something this ""anti-woman"" is happening in one of the most Liberal states in the country. For two, when something like this actually happens you cry foul and struggle to take action but the real problem is the hypocrisy in it all.  The truth is when all that fake idealism is replaced with a healthy realism, you will vote republican and guys like this will be off the street. Stop contributing to the problem and be a part of the solution."

"Why would you assume that she was to reproduce from her current eggs?  She could have easily have frozen eggs or fertilized embryos at a younger age to either be surrogated or carried herself.

"I think you're right, Monte, in your conclusion that this issue won't easily go away. But IMHO, the reason is that the  battle is being fought primarily on ideological grounds, and is driven by the. need to be right. W.O. will only cease to be an issue as the Holy Spirit is seen working in remarkable ways through women as leaders to transform lives and faith communities. It was stories of Holy Spirit power witnessing through the lives of uncircumcised gentiles that made the issue of circumcision go away for the early Christian church. 

The evidence that anti-W.O. sentiment bears significant responsibility for membership attrition is not persuasive to me for many reasons. Nor is it particularly relevant. I am aware of no data supporting the idea that ordained women are more effective in bringing folks to Christ than are ""commissioned/ordained"" women. 

I completely support W.O. But it is sad that the issue won't go away. As Jim observes, not all conflicts need resolution."
"Ruben Reyes said:  ""There is no cause for anyone to speak up for Muslims, Latinos, women and so-called ""healthcare cutbacks"" simply because all of that are nothing more than based on anti-Trump media propaganda.""

"You may be right but I heard an employment lawyer (who typically represents employees not companies) speak today on that very topic and there are some problems with him claiming that. Unfortunately I didn't catch all the issues with his claim other than simply being fired after doing something the company doesn't like isn't enough to prove it's retaliatory and the fact he stated in a company email that the class of workers that is female is inferior because of their sex violated some company diversity policy. In any event, this will never get to a trial, Google will give him some money to shut up and go away."

At your age, or at least in my teens and early twenties, before 1992/4, I may not have been as poetic or as expressive as you, but I felt emotions similar to those I read in your article. I did not have the same motivations as you, I was not oppressed and I'm not sure I can convince you that I had the interest of your people at heart, nor that it was a pure emotion rather that the condescension of what today would be called the ""colonist"".

"Three of the four (all but Trump) are putatively Catholic. 
When Giuliani was launching into a tirade about Bill Clinton's sexual misconduct on Meet the Press, echoing Trump's suggestion (with no evidence) that Hillary was not a faithful wife, Chuck Todd challenged Giuliani. The exchange went like this:
<<But, Todd responded, ""You have your own infidelity charge."" 
""Well, everybody does,"" Giuliani said. ""And I'm a Roman Catholic, and I confess those things to my priest."">>
So ... infidelity is ok for Catholics, by Giuliani's lights, as long as they confess. This is an anti-Catholic canard I remember from my youth: You Catholics can do anything you want as long as you tell the priest on Saturday.

That was destroyed in the 90's with enforced diversity and educated immigrants. Suddenly you had Chinese, Indian and Arab cultures invade work environments and bringing their own way of doing things. 

Everything only half works and the real Canadians (not the duals) hate having to work incompetently now because ""that's how we do things here now."" That's a quote. They don't design. They guess. Literally. And these are Ph.D.'s.

"The article admits, ""GC policy assigns to the union conferences the decisions about which individuals to ordain as clergy."" It therefore admits that unions derive their authority regarding ordination from the GC. 

Think about it: If the article is correct about the 1995 and 2015 votes, what were those votes even about? Divisions deciding whether ordination of women could occur within their territory, but that has nothing at all to do with whether unions can ordain women? There is no possibility such a contention makes any sense."

"I find this article not only one-sided but completely lopsided. The use of military terms to define the objection of a health worker to terminate a life through abortion cuts to the heart of the debate: The battle of Pro-life vs. Abortion. The question is: Who represents the rights of the health worker and who represents the rights of the unborn baby? 
There are documented cases where German soldiers refused to comply with the internment and termination of Jews in Nazi death-camps. According to this article, as it uses military terms (as if abortion is war), these soldiers, who were court-martialed or shot, were in the wrong. They should have toed the line and were executed for being “dishonourably disobedient”. 
Even if the system says that abortion is legal, where does this leave the health-worker? Should the beliefs of the worker, e.g. being Muslim, govern their actions, it is wrong?
The lopsided argument is one of causality: Illegal abortions are caused by objectors? Really?"

"(Part 2); many sacrifices were made to make it all work... I wouldn't change one iota of it, nor would I change my decision to get ""snipped"" to prevent further procreation of new life.

How anyone can perceive this as ""denying another the opportunity of life"" is far beyond me, given that my wife and I already had as many children as we had hands to clothe and feed them. 

Further, Kevin, for you to imply that our decision ""is sinful and this is known innately by mankind"" is not only insulting but it is equally ludicrous.

Women are free under the law to kill their unborn children for whatever reason, it is up to them whether they heed the Word of God or ignore it. The punishment will probably not be in this life although it sometimes is but it most certainly will be in the next. The Church simply points out the eternal consequences of this choice.

DIdn't notice any demands on women driving anywhere while wearing whatever they please and choosing the freedom to go dating with whom they decide and  lets not forget  the ability to question religious ideology  and who came up with what for the benefit of personal control and indoctrination through fear and punishment.
"To be technical, no one breaks in during an abortion. Entry is voluntarily granted and in more and more cases the abortion is pharmacological. It is society that is not allowed to break in unless you make the that growing life a legal person, whether the intention to abort is there or not. Then the state is breaking into every pregnancy. Are you willing to mandate that level of intrusion into obstetrics and the medical decisions of women and families? Do you think you can get the votes in Congress for that, because without those, Roe stays because Roe Part X is the decision rule. States are not constitutionally competent to alter the terms of personhood. The movement will never negotiate a solution because the people who feed at the trough like getting paid on both sides of the issue. Speaking the truth does not make me a party to murder. Going with the lie makes the GOP a party to fraud."
"Yes, women should always be open and nice and accommodating and malleable and anything else you want them to be. 

What a load. Sorry world, women are done pandering to your expectations."
"I guess my response got voted down because it's perfectly acceptable to accuse women who have had abortion of being ""murderers"" but calling anti-abortion activists ""vicious"" who advocate rape and incest victims bringing babies to term is beyond the bounds of civility.

Rank sexism."
"Oh! This to me is one of your best. I makes me want to ask as well as to think and that is a good thing. Is it that ""your fears"" exclude those fears which you attribute to the ""white folk"" or is it that you see it as an ""overlay"" a scale of priority-intimates? Or, as I suspect, it  might apply also to a great many of the marginalized who do not have the oppertunities you have - I do not have the ""freedom"" that allows me to think beyond my fear. 
Maslov's hierarchy of ""needs"" applies here, I think, in a most incarnate way that goes beyond the theory to the side-walk.
I think I ""get"" the woman alone vulnerability, but I cannot but sense the additional vulnerability of a ""black"",  a Muslim, or other that further ""intrigues"" the sick or triggers the one on the edge.

"Add this small and annoying irrelevant story to the list of things Hillary 'didn't know'.  Does anyone happen to have a list of  anything that Hillary DID know cuz this woman was either stupid as hell or kept in the dark about every detail of how her campaign worked.

"Pennies on the billions stolen from the tribes and individuals by mainly the Oil Monopoly led by EXXON(originally Standard Oil Trust).  Unfortunately, Eloise Cobell, the brave Blackfoot woman who forced the government to acknowledge their failures, died before any disbursement of funds owed to her and her brethren.  She fought the Clinton Administration, Bush Administration, and Obama Administration.  The final settlement of her case was drastically reduced by Exxon-bought judges in Washington D.C.  None of the corporate thieves have paid any penalty while the rest of the nation pays for their corruption.  So what else is new?"
"The only thing we know Trump is for is Trump. Most of his life he's been vocally pro-choice. I don't buy his recent ""conversion"" to the pro-life cause anymore than I buy that he's respectful of women."
"Okay. But what will you accept as proof?  It will always be his word against hers. She is a mother and a Republican.  And a few other women said he pursued them when they were teenagers. So is that ""proof""?

"Right, the woman is A OK.  No problemo.  Just out for a nice drive when that damn store jumped in front of her car.  Besides, the devil make her do it. And you know the devil can do some weird shit, but she most definitely is blessed.  My only advice to y'all is watch out for those purple Tahoe's.  She had a Constitutional right to bounce a $2,200 check.  There should be a Federal investigation and have the DOJ take over the local police department for bothered this blessed woman.  You can't discriminate against women who bounce checks."
"A big part of governing is budgeting, and therefore it should always be acceptable for one politician to question the math of another politician.  Being female is no defense.  However, Nenshi would have been better to simply say ""Check your math"".  Of course, he has to be prepared to back up his own math."
"Who put them up to it?  Simple. Her Grace came to Denver a couple of days ago and sat for an interview with the editorial board.   I'm sure it made them positively giddy to have such a personage in their midst as they called a woman who can't remember the president's name and hasn't been able to get back in the majority for 6 years a ""brilliant politician"".  Hence the breathless editorial extolling something they can't even quite figure out.  

It appears someone hacked this laudatory editorial with the truth ""But it’s important to note neither approach to job creation has a proven track record: tax cuts don’t always stimulate hiring; and subsidies for employers can be astronomically expensive per job and short lived.""  which makes the rest of the fawning sort of hilarious - ""They have this marvelous idea, we're not sure of the specifics, but it's gonna be great, of course it's been tried and not worked, but they want to try it again as an experiment.  How exciting!"""

I know you think it sounds all super fun and all to kill all those you disagree with, Kimmy, but I can assure you that, in hindsight, you would find that it would be better to work things out politically like an adult instead of holding your breath like a petulant child and striking out at mommy.

"Each time I ""compose myself"" and acknowledge that I am in the presence of God it becomes just a bit more clear that the mercy of God is penetrating my being.  Even in my sinfulness, in my belief and unbelief, God's will for my love becomes more clear and lovely.  Like a mother's warm poultice it is ""drawing"" away my fear, guilt, idolatry, my disdain in the face of the merciless, like puss from a boil. 
I get the 2+2=5 metaphor of mercy.  Simply, like the mercy of God, it does not make any rational sense at all. It is somehow founded upon the civility, friendship, love of Aristotle's wisdom, the 2+2, taken beyond, not only to a new level in Jesus' redemption but also in the companionship with God in creation unfolding. We can contemplate but never understand. We have to just listen, learn, accept and enjoin, hopefully."
"Before Obamacare, in 1997, I bought a PPO policy from United Healthcare for my wife and I.  $4500 deductible, $253/mo.

By 2009, the same plan was $1643/mo.  In 2010, the premium fell to $1176/mo.  When I discontinued the plan in 2015, the premiums still hadn't risen to pre-ACA levels."

"Anyone who criticized Gore's Inconvenient Truth was labeled a flat-earth dinosaur. Today, no self-respecting scientist would endorse any of Gore's models because they are an embarrassment to science. The discussion of ""climate change"" has been hijacked by a vocal minority of special interest groups - even Bjorn Lomborg was treated with hostility for challenging Gore's ""Truths"". Climate change has taken on a zealotry that parallels religious fanaticism. Science should be free of political bias but that concept is laughable in today's universities. Any academic who challenges ""accepted"" theories (like the impending apocalypse from climate change) faces professional ruin. It applies to all disciplines - the Globe still ignores any discussion of Jordan Peterson. The UN just elected Saudi Arabia to a panel on women's rights, just oozing with credibility. How about the relationship with population growth (birth rates) and environmental degradation (but birth control is blasphemous!)."

Duncan champions equality of outcomes - which is effectively championing mediocrity."
"You're right: I didn't live through it, not in the way the Sisters did.

"They aren't just Rachael Harder's 'personal opinions.'

She went on record with her views on abortion during the 2015 election campaign when she filled out a questionnaire from Campaign Life Coalition, an anti-abortion lobby group. 

One question was: ”If elected, will you strive to introduce and pass laws to protect unborn children from the time of conception (fertilization) onward?” She answered “yes.” 

She did, however, say she would allow abortions where the mother’s life was at stake. (CLC had tipped its hand and said it wouldn’t consider that “abortion.”)"
"PS: I just reviewed all my posts in this--the stray & feral cat--thread, from 24 through 3 hours ago.  I did not call you a single name.  Did I ridicule your arguments?  Absolutely.  There is a difference, and my doing so was entirely justified.  If you disagree, reproduce--as in cut-and-paste--an excerpt from the last five posts wherein a ""called you a name.""

PPS: Just reviewed the posts in the bike-thread too.  The closest I came to name-calling was the following: ""Whizzed right past that pointy little head, didn't it?"", which, while admittedly unkind, was no more so than your absurd arguments deserved: ""So it is a case of ""your hobby isn't my hobby, so, therefore, you shouldn't practice it?""; ""is this a situation where I shouldn't have a hobby because i'm a woman and therefore should be raising children?""

In the context of the discussion these were ABYSMALLY stupid rebuttals, and they deserved to be called out as such.  Not a personal attack.  If you don't like it, do better."
"Jessica,
Try closing your eyes and look at a few of the female visitors who are sitting funny in the visiting room. They are carrying drugs in a place where the sun doesn’t shine or the place next to that.

"I can't agree that a single woman with a couple of kids and a part-time job who is collecting housing subsidies, SNAP, and the EITC, along with various other subsidies and benefits from state and federal sources is ""incompetent"" for taking advantage of what the Welfare State offers.  It's not in her financial self interest to get the skills to get a better paying job, unless it pays $50,000-$60,000.  The problem is the Welfare State, not the people who take what's offered.

As we learned from the conservative welfare reform of the 1990's, if they have to get a full time job to support themselves, they will."
"In the light of the deputy Minister of Higher education assaulting a young woman at a night club, and now the ""FIRST LADY of Zimbabwe"" committing the same crime, Where does the ANC stand on their famous saying, ""WOMAN'S rights should be strictly observed."" Perhaps the various female Ministers in our Cabinet would like to issue a comment, Their current silence in itself is a mockery of the ANC's form of INTEGRITY.
Perhaps we should just issue diplomatic immunity to every visitor form outside our boarders and include the same immunity to our MINISTERS of our country RSA.
Then they would all be free to commit crime in our country without fear of prosecution.
THAT way we would know that the ANC is a genuine fake organization.
That way we would understand the saying that all are equal in the eyes of the law.

Gender by itself will not guarantee successful police work, but I wonder if she might be more adept with the many tough issues facing HPD. In addition, the next police chief could benefit from a degree in social work instead of criminology and work experiences with segments of our population not well-represented politically. See the example of Heather Fong, former chief of police of San Francisco."

Whether you like it or not, the US Constitution protects religious freedom.  Religious freedom is going to affect people.

I certainly care for the rights of women.  When a women wants a medical procedure done on her that does not affect someone else's life, I don't care what she wants to do.  If a women wants to have her Thorax taken out, by all means let her do it.  If a women wants her gall bladder taken out, let her do it.  If a women wants to cut off her leg for whatever reason, by all means, let her do it.

FBI head Comey made unwarranted editorial comments as he announced that no charges would be recommended against Clinton or any of her aides but he most certainly did not say she was ""unfit for the office"". She is probably the most qualified person we have had run for the office of POTUS in the nations history and will make a great President starting next January. Are you a relation of Les Brown?

"Reverendo,

I think you have a very valid point.  When the results of the San Antonio vote were announced, there was a collective gasp in the crowd of onlookers.  Anyone who understands how to count noses, realized that a fair number of ""third world"" delegates, must have voted YES.

In addition to being a ""urban"" vs ""rural"" split as you suggest, I think there was and is also a strong generational split on this question, around the world.  Even in Africa we are seeing a few women appear as heads of state.  Younger people are growing-up with the idea that women can and and do have leadership gifts and roles apart from the home, and caring for the elderly and the children.

But in some cultures the younger SDA leaders are unwilling to openly oppose their elders.  They will simply wait for them to retire and/or die.  And I think some of these elders sense this, which is why they have become so urgent to stop-out the new ideas now.

This is as much age-ism as sex-ism."

"LFS:  The real question is ""Does your wife have 40 ""credits"" to qualify her for SS benefits?""  If the answer is ""yes"" she qualifies and can receive benefits based on her earnings and SS contributions when she reaches the ""benefit eligible"" age.  If she is ""short"" of those 40 credits she will need to work in a SS eligible job for enough additional quarters to reach that threshold.
How do I earn Social Security credits and how many do I need to qualify for benefits?
We use your total yearly earnings to figure your Social Security credits. The amount needed for a credit in 2016 is $1,260. You can earn a maximum of four credits for any year. The amount needed to earn one credit increases automatically each year when average wages increase.
You must earn a certain number of credits to qualify for Social Security benefits. The number of credits you need depends on your age when you apply and the type of benefit application. No one needs more than 40 credits for any Social Security benefit."
"They were packed, I think, with the children of immigrants and those older grandchildren who did not question anything.  The end of Vatican II happened to coincide, in this country, with a lot of questioning of authority: Vietnam, middle class women's roles, the sexual double standard, women's rights, gay rights, etc.  I think that it was a fluke that Vatican II ended just as the more rebellious sixties began.

That is not her fault and someone has to start women's hockey, but to imply she is one the greatest female athletes who pushed the limits of what a women can do is hyperbole.

"The main help homeless people need is shelter, and Eugene doesn't have anywhere near enough of it. The services offered may require a homeless person to walk for miles, carrying all of their stuff, from wherever they've found to hide for the night so the cops won't hassle them. Being homeless is exhausting. People are too busy just trying to survive and get what they need every day to focus on getting housed. Some of them are old, disabled, sick. The women are vulnerable to attack by both the small minority of predatory homeless as well as the housed. Homeless youth are often forced into prostitution to survive, while people complain about their panhandling. 

All cities have a homeless problem, mainly because of not enough jobs, low wages and high rents. Eugene is not ""better than a lot of places"", nor is it a magnet. Housed people need to stop telling themselves fairy tales, and focus on solutions.

"God knew us all before we were conceived in our mother's womb. As Jeremiah prophesied;

""Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, before you were born I set you apart;""

He has a plan for each one of us before we are born. As human beings, I don't think that we have the right to terminate that plan. 

I used to think the same way as you about abortion, Lillian, thinking that we had the right to choose whether life began at birth or at conception. But later on I realized that we choose the point of birth purely because it's more convenient for us, both as people and as a society. However, with modern medical technology, a child can be born several months early, and yet live a full life."

I am saying it is impossible to call the loss of an embryo murder; most are lost anyway. To call the loss of sperm  murder is equally ridiculous.  

Believe it or not, I do not personally like abortion at all, but I personally believe that some are medically very necessary to prevent the loss of life of a woman and or mother.  So no I do not support either abortion or death penalty.  I would however appose any law that categorically refuses abortion in all cases. Such a law would be ill advised and completely unethical.    It is also ludicrous to call loss of embryo's abortion or even more ridiculous to call it murder."
"At last night awards ceremony, Natalie did not mention Jackie Kennedy, the woman she was portraying in her Thank you speech.

Jackie Kennedy had class. Perhaps Ms. Portman could find some."
"Close to 100%. The ceasefire is in the interest of both Russia and Syria, since it will allow them to consolidate their positions. Then of course, having regrouped and resupplied, they can return to bombing and gassing the rebels and of course, the Syrian women, children, and non-combatants."

Her endless shakedowns and downright treason will be far more damaging to our nation, and Bill will continue his assaults on women, which dwarf Trump's.

I am still voting against Hillary."
"Those women are mocking vulgarity, not embracing it. By doing so, they point out that Trump is a sexist pig.

"It'll never happen; to do so would be political suicide.  The question becomes, however, how far do the social conservative values go when it comes to other issues?  That is, if you are anti-choice or gay marriage, are you going to lean to the hard right on climate, crime, and economics?  Everyone knows the abortion debate isn't going to get re-opened in Canada."
"That pre-sixties ""omnipresent and omni-invasive"" cloud over society was associated--just before it burst wide open--not only with Catholicism but with the premier, Maurice Duplessis, a populist tyrant who refused to modernize Quebec society and used the Church as an ally and justification for his brutal policies. It was not surprising that Quebeckers rejected this vision and never returned to it. I understand what Francis is trying to do and it'll be interesting if the bishops pay attention and . . . try something different. Durocher is a supporter of opening the diaconate to women."

"The electors referenced are indeed Democratic electors, and they are supposed to vote for Hilary given she carried WA state. Supposed to but not required. Interestingly, if there were enough electors from the states Trump won who refuse to vote for him, and cast their vote for another Republican, the Democratic electors could join in to add their votes for that person, and possibly create a surprise outcome. 

Note that Trump isn't elected until those forecasted electoral votes actually are cast for him on December 19. None of the electors has to vote for him. Being party faithful, they won't likely cross party boundaries, but they could, for instance, cast their votes for Pence and make him President instead. Or pick another person.

Per the Constitution, only the Electoral college can determine the President and Vice President."
"Snowflake, get your facts straight.  Senators and Congressmen/women are required to participate in the Affordable Care Act.

"Yes, The PM said  ""A Canadian is a Canadian is a Canadian"" and he also said that ""Diversity is our strength"" and that ""Canada is the first post-national state"" with no common underlying values.

All of which means that Canadians can wear anything or nothing at all as they so choose.

Now I happen to agree with most Quebecers and most western Europeans that public servants must reveal themselves to the public they are serving and that those seeking public entitlements/services from public servants must reveal themselves to said public servants.  It is about social integration, integrity of the benefits/entitlements system, security of the general public and, last but not least, the emancipation of Muslim women from the dehumanizing, demeaning and subservient practice of full face covering.

The PM disagrees but also knows he has no hope of repeating his 2015 majority in 2019 without holding his Quebec seats.

So you see he does stand for something after all - for political expediency!"

"Rock, I think the truth is that some women have been willing to pay the price of advancing their careers, have deliberately done so, have been hoodwinked or somehow tricked into a ""pass"" going further than intended, have been raped, have kept silent afterwards out of shame, fear, or because  they didn't see causing a fuss producing anything but trouble.  There are many, I am sure, who refused to pay the price and went home.  

We can analyze this to pieces, come up with all the possible choices, etc., but I think what is happening now is that many of those who were tricked or felt coerced, or just went along to make career progress - they now want it to stop.  What I don't want to do is for the conversation to get stuck in the did she/didn't she have choices and move on to the idea that now we are talking about getting it to stop.

"Since 2004 in Canada there have been over 1.0 million legal abortions performed, with the majority of those abortions being carried out on healthy women. Further the law in Canada places no restrictions of the term of gestation thus an abortion can and has been performed on women nine months pregnant.

One thing I see on this forum is that many people are ready to think the worst about people who've got themselves in trouble. I think it's wrong to jump to conclusions and I think the poster who called what this woman did ""attempted murder"" was not only wrong but completely off the wall. My point is that she doesn't look like a complete mess, like the woman who rammed her boyfriend's car - now That could be seen as attempted murder.

"It's all anecdotal.

Thomas Patrick Doyle is completely unreliable.

The teaching on the ordination of women and the immorality of sexual relations outside of marriage are irreformable no matter how you characterize them. The Church leads people to reform their lives, not the other way around. Your opinion of that is of no consequence.

Ms Vinis qualified to be the only person on the ballot in November by achieving a majority of the votes cast, and, yes, those disgruntled voters have every right to launch a ""write-in"" campaign to oppose her election in November.   

I was rather surprised that Ms Vinis won.  The polls I saw seemed to show Mr. Clark with a decided lead.  However, I think the Vinis supporters did an admirable job with a ""get out the vote"" effort.

"We are being asked to sympathize and emphasize with the missing and murdered Indigenous women and their families. Let's be clear: I do. However, right now, two women in Sask are bringing a class action lawsuit against the Sask government, saying they were coerced into having their tubes tied. When they were sterilized after their last babies were born, one woman had 7 children, the other 9, none of whom are living with them. (They say it is their 'culture' that their children be raised by other family members. They say their attractiveness as a love interest has ended because they are no longer able to bear children.) Elsewhere, two sisters living 'high risk lifestyles' in Calgary were murdered recently. They left 16 children between them. Until these women realize that being a baby mill is not a life, monthly income aside, there will continue to be missing and murdered women. Let's get these women a real job, so they can kick their partners to the curb."

My aggrevation:  Why is it I did not hear this from WOC, whose people were those being escorted by Police?  I was told that the women protesters were treated pretty well.  That they were escorted & made to hand over stoles before the mass, if they were wearing them, but WOC never pointed out that a ticket holding, ordained, Anglican Priest was treated like a threat & called a provocateur because she was wearing her normal priestly clerical collar.   WOC seems to be rating its treatment in Rome by the standard, if we didn't get arrested this year like last year, then we are being treated pretty well. 

WOC needs to complain more aggressively.  Part of what our church leadership counts on is that women protesters aren't too loud.  I am also concerned with WOCs message weakening into begging for perm. deacon ordinations instead of demanding equality w/priesthood.  We need to show more integrity & anger."

"Dan, I think that the GOP Senate is looking into the next year and have worked on a recent bill to fund Labor-Health and Human Services they brought up bipartisan by US Senators, a Democrat (Patty Murray, WA and GOP Roy Blunt , MO that fund  (gasp) the ACA , women's services and it has no silly ""rider"" inserted in it to stop abortion or gay people from marrying or women working in the senate from wearing short skirts, items that often cause arguments between parties that stall the bill.

Obviously nothing in the way of a reason for the shooting at the mosque has come out yet, but labelling it a terrorist attack seems a little premature. It doesn't random as terrorist attacks usually are, and it does seem that there was an anti-Muslim sentiment at play. If  a particular group in our society is targeted the law refers tot hat as a hate  crime. Labelling this terrorism seems more political then fact."

"Wholeheartedly agree, but I think it's worth mentioning that few whites polled today will have accurate memories of the 1950s as a whole, and many polled were probably not alive during the 1950s at all. 
When they speak fondly of the 1950s, they likely do not even consider the evils against people of color, dissidents, women, sexual minorities... They mean a cozy, safe world without the stresses of 2016.

Others vote for her so they can show how ""liberal"" they are. Others are simply scared. They are afraid of the status quo changing, even for something better. Its time to lose the political correctness and the fear. Vote for someone who will make a difference and get our country back."

"This wasn't just luck. She got away through her own efforts. She shouted for help and jumped overboard. The quote from the trooper is his view, but the word choice within the body of the article is the reporter's bias. This type of word choice is a little thing which through repetition results in women not being taking seriously when they ask for help or report pain. It can also result in women believing they're helpless when faced with sexual assault. I'm right on that feminist train if it means arming women against sexual assault."

How dare she!? The media is appalled and one thundering denunciation follows another from every columnist! Why, to suggest that a prospective immigrant who thinks all women are second class citizens, and that gays and Jews should be killed should be barred from becoming a Canadian is UnCanadian!

"For the life of me, I cannot imagine why a Canadian woman would voluntarily wear the niqab. I have read many articles written by muslim women - and by some Imams - stating that it is not required by Islam.

Does it give them some feeling of power to 'stick it' to the infidel?"

It is obvious that many of the Charlottesville white nationalist supremacists (Neo-Nazis) with marching permits consider themselves as Christians.

"You may consider how the public media speaks to our reps in office also . The Kingston Community News for instance draws her opinions based on the pejorative motives of people who disagree with her .

"Of course we do not require doctors to perform abortions against their will. That has nothing to do with this.

To use your analogy we'd have to be talking about an abortion doctor who refused their services to Hindus. 

This is a civil rights issue. In the same way that you cannot put up a sign in your store that says ""no blacks"" you are not allowed to discriminate based on who someone is. You have every right to discriminate based on what someone does however (no shoes no shirt no service). Because this baker had a business open to the public, but refused his services because they were gay, he violated their civil rights. 

He actually has done the right thing by refusing to offer cakes at all. If he can't stomach the idea that his services would be used by the public, of which some citizens might be gay, then he should not make cakes. Same thing for racist doctors: if you offer right to die services but don't like the idea of serving black people then you shouldn't offer it at all."
"Those are countries, not religions. FACT

"""Two unrelated events conspired to dull the moral sensibilities of the Catholic clergy: the pro-abortion stance of the Democrats in the 1970s and the Southern strategy adopted by the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts in the mid-1960s.""

Don't blame the bishops callous disregard for anything but abortion on those who seek to keep abortion legal.  The bishops chose and they are responsible for their choices - to ignore racism, to ignore basic health care. The bishops are responsible all by themselves for their obsession on one issue to the exclusion of all others.  Trump is in because they would not address his sexism, his racism, his crudity. That millions could lose health care doesn't matter as long as they get to keep their ""religious freedom"" to dominate others, to deny them the ability to make their own health decisions on something as normal and simply as contraceptives or as life saving as sterilization which would reduce abortions."
"Hello Richard Roskell,

In 1988, in the Morgentaler ruling on ACCESS TO THE MEDICAL PROCEDURE of abortion, most of the judges (5 of 7) agreed that the government's laws at that time ""violated Canadian women’s constitutional rights to the security of the person"".

Given two logical observations, that failure to provide ANY life-saving hospital procedure is obviously a threat to security of the person, and that government laws and government policies are what functionally provide and determine the access of Canadians to hospital services... 

... there is really nothing radical or off-base about the notion floated in the original post-writer's wish...."

Young people, enamoured with Uber and Amazon, don't possess the lens to view the deleterious impact they are having on society. The need for multiple jobs, is a need, not so much a choice. Raising the minimum wage and experimenting with universal basic income is all part of a government balancing act to deal with the fact that good paying jobs are disappearing at a rapid rate, and sadly, they are not coming back. So yes, young women should embrace the ""gig"" economy...because they really will have no other choice. :("

I'd like to see Laura and Barbara Bush buy a TV ad the week before the November elections and look into the camera and quote tRump verbatim about groping and grabbing women by the p___y.

From this POV, you are not much different than those that still remain loyal to Hitler, who I have met some. I know one woman that MET hitler when she was a child; still likes him and has your logic ."
"Correct. Once it came about that enough fools voted for tRump, even after listening to those tapes and seeing the way he talked about women when he was denying the accusers' claims, certainly shows that it is not a subject they care about unless they can gloat about Hollywood liberals."

"Wouldn't a true Christian repent?  I'm talking about Munoz's fellow church member.  This mentality -"" I'm religious so I can do no wrong/ should not be punished for my wrong doings"" is dangerous and perhaps the most sickening thing about religion.  The fact that Munoz uses it as a reason to have this woman avoid punishment speaks volumes about Munoz.  Also, many child rapists have a ton of great deeds to talk about, until you examine them in light of their actions.  Many are volunteer coaches and Sunday school teachers - for a reason."
"You stated, ""a place for kids to play"".  ANYONE  who lets their kids play in the streets is ""STUPID""., whether its a neighborhood street  or not.  In neighborhoods, people back out of their driveways all the time and kids do get run over.   Its like the woman several months ago that was caught towing her kids  on a sled behind her car out in the street.   Hmmmm, should be a law against ""STUPIDITY"".     Let the kids play in the back yard, or front yard, or take them to a playground.    Pedestrians need to stay on the sidewalks and out of the street.  If there are NO sidewalks, cyclists and walkers should stay off of the streets.  Smart people that want to walk or hike drive to places like Mt. Pisgah, or Fern Ridge, or bikepaths, or one of the many parks, there are thousands of places to safely walk and bike."

"Oh this is disconcerting. In a time I where there are many families- mothers struggling with sometimes three part time jobs, no paid sick time or employment bennies,substandard housing and the threat of worse to come-Heidi what in God's holy name are you thinking. So many families can not imagine a plane ride.Other families are spending their vacation time in hospitals or at home caring for children,parents, or spouses because our nation whose major evangelical leaders prayed and laid hands on our so called leader refuse  to follow the golden rule and support paid family leave.
There is nothing wrong with rest and relaxation. Jesus did it - but writing about something enabled because of high SES ,family money, or privelged luck requires a different substanstansive viewpoint.Rather what can the family do together to help the country and the world?

Yet, with Madame Merkel's guidance, you found in your hearts the compassionate willingness to invite and support, with your taxes, criminals and savages from the most primitive countries of the world pretending to be refugees. Your open-mindedness compelled you to allow them to destroy your country, kill your people, rape your women, all as valued contribution to the leftist diversity generally. You really are altruistic people, but so are we, Canadians and, as a first gesture, we are prepared to let you keep them all, and if more are to come to destroy the civilized world, keep those as well...just do not let them come to Canada."

"Statues, kneelers, etc. do not constitute the FAITH.  Imitating Jesus in our lives DOES.  The term  the ""Holy Sacrifice of the Mass"" came much, much later in church history.  Do you believe in a god who is so blood-thirsty, that only the blood sacrifice of a BELOVED Son could appease him?  When did Jesus present his Father that way?

Since July 25, 1968---when 'Humanae vitae' was promulgated by the church, women---by the thousands LEFT the church and took their families with them.  These women, now, are senior citizens.  Neither they, their children nor grandchildren are registered in any church.  The ""Stone-wall riots"" [June 28, 1969], came to symbolize the inaugural movement of the gay liberation movement.  And this has continued on for 5 decades.  People have left the church because of the hierarchy's pronouncements concerning ""intrinsic disorders"".  

Sadly, you associate ""having faith"" with the hierarchy's[and JP II & Benedict's] obsession with the ""below the belt"" mandate."

"It was not the case. We were already after the vigil so we put our banners back into our bags, we were wearing scarves of the type many women wear everyday and our ARCWP women priests put their stoles into their bags too. I remember they were ready to give back the albas (although with some degree of hesitance) to the police as well but the police said they could have them (even if told these were albas) and the Vatican's gendarmerie didn't recognize it as albas. There was simply no reason for such reaction. By the way they still kept an eye on us so they could immediately react if we did something inappropriate. But we prayed peacefully with other pilgrims."

It is no secret that our beloved Mother Church is in the midst of a long decline in attendance in the developed world, and that the conservatives really have no idea how to cope with it.  It is time for a new approach and emphasis - one that is geared to serving, not being served, and one that desires mercy, not sacrifice.  We've had the 'authoritarian church' for 35 years - let's give the 'serving church' a try.  You can't go wrong imitating Jesus ..."

1. The statement about blaming ""Hillary Clinton"" is NOT fundamentally wrong.""  It is fundamentally true--the President tweeted just that, the tweet is quoted.  However, what IS wrong is the act of blaming. 

2. Balance in journalism is achieved when a columnist (not a journalist) writes an opinion piece to off-set the facts-only news stories written by journalists. This is what Ms.Kendzior has done. 

3. ""To anyone looking at this objectively, it’s clear that both sides were so pathologically driven to win at all costs, they were willing to get in bed with the Russians to win.""

Perhaps if she had help early on, her following 49 years of life would have been much different. We should all watch out for each other.Blessings to Carrie Lucinda Miller, and those who love her."

"Despite her early excellent anti-war work, Coleen is now an example of someone who refuses to listen to or read progressive Syrian voices to understand this conflict.  Her understanding is U.S.-centric, unable to see the world through the eyes of others. Syrian dissident Yassin al Haj Saleh says, for western ""anti-imperialists"": ""We, rank-and-file Syrians, refugees, women, students, intellectuals, human rights activists, political prisoners  do not exist.""

Coleen has not discussed Syria with Syrians.  She does not read progressive Syrians.  She reads and quotes non-Syrians.  It is an arrogant, chauvinist attitude to dismiss ALL Syrians and assume one can be an authority on the Syrian conflict by picking and choosing articles from the internet.

The irony of mocking someone who left ""your"" school because other students were bullying and mocking them, is amazing.  It was different from Donald's comments since they didn't boast of commiting sexual assault.

"Women's reproductive rights, including the right to terminate a pregnancy, are under attack in this country. There is no talk of ""expanding"" them.

"Continuation:
I have a different perspective on celibacy and ""sacrifice"" than you do.
I don't believe that imposed celibacy does anything to promote the rights of women.  
I also believe that imposed celibacy does nothing to create better priests.  If people who want to be priests choose to be celibate, that is one thing.  To require them to make a choice between serving the people of God and being married is quite another.  
I think that by refusing to ordain women, the Church is committing a serious wrong.  But I also believe that allowing only celibate women to be ordained would be wrong and would be doing violence to the women who are called to serve the people of God through the priesthood."
"Looks to me like Trump has been one of the few good thing in her life.

Porn star, accomplice to murder, death threats to a judge and the girlfriend of a major drug cartel trafficker, Alvarez-Vazquez ""El Indio"", who she had an “anchor baby” with. She’s a real charmer and since Hillary’s political aspirations are to Make America Venezuela, Machado is a perfect fit to her message.

"Back in the USSR, fake news was the mainstay of Pravda. When Pravda reported a bumper crop of wheat, the people knew they would go hungry.

"After ""Slick Willie"" vetoed welfare reform several times and was finally brought to heel by Newt Gingrich and the Republican Congress.   Shortly after welfare reform was enacted I was tasked by a very reluctant Knowles Administration to try to figure out how to work ""Welfare to Work"" in merit system jobs in a unionized employer.   What we found was that a woman with a kid who used all of her benefits had an income equivalent to a State Range 14 or 16 and probably had more disposable income.   Those are jobs that take several years of progressively responsible experience or a college degree.   Most couldn't qualify for an entry Range 8 or 10.   We didn't get many and most didn't stay very long; why get up and go to work when you can sit home in your robe and make more?"
I hope Dana is right
"Feminism is stronger than it's ever been, so I don't know why she's so downcast.  Marches made lots of new, next to no criticism other than the obvious - where  was this movement before the election?  But then, Clinton did have more votes than Trump (just not spread over the right states ... really too bad) but a significant number of women voters cast their ballot for him too (although I don't know why).  If the marches made people feel united and feel better then all for the good (much better than the hooligans busting things up the day before).  Only down point was that provocateur Madonna with her expletive choice of words - below the Trump level."

"So isn't there discussion boards there to haunt?  Or did you get banned because you call liberals pukes?  I mean it's clear you're afraid of women but why would you think a business failure fascist wannabe like Trump is somehow better for the nation.  You do realize, after you indicate you have a determination waiting from the VA, that a President Trump would deny your claim in a heartbeat right?  In his mind you're not strong and can't handle stress.  You are the very model of people who consistently support people who are against your very own self interest."
"Why is it a bad thing? If you require cameras, sensors, and assisted parallel parking in order to drive these useless, bloated vehicles, then you should not be driving them at all. All these ""innovations"" only serve to enable poor driving habits. So what happens when there is an electrical failure and that blind spot sensor that you depend on malfunctions, do you just collide into someone when changing lanes? These vehicles are a cancer on our roads and highways. The owners of these vehicles are, by far, the most distracted on the road. Every morning during my commute in the GTA, I see countless people (mostly women) in crossovers/SUVs, talking, texting, eating, drinking, smoking, and putting on make-up all at the same time, while driving over the curbs to make a turn. Technology should not be used to substitute good driving habits/skills."

It’s a Toronto Police press conference. Two individuals walked into a jewelry store wearing burkas and cleaned it out at gunpoint. They were not muslim women, but allowing a segment of society to normalize such clothing created a situation where the criminal’s “disguise” raised little notice or suspicion as they travelled to and from their mark and made them near impossible to identify. Listen to the investigating officer’s frustration, the p.c. media questioning, and how no one wants to directly address the elephant in the room. Bravo Quebec."

"I am so disturbed by the election of Trump that I am still having difficulty sleeping at night.  The list of actions that I anticipate from him, that will do real damage to our country, is long.  It seems clear that the gap between rich and poor will grow wider, that millions of latinos will be rounded up and deported in police raids, that race relations will worsen, that women’s rights will be abridged, that science and research investments will be eviscerated and so on.  Republican control of the Supreme Court means that efforts to restrict the corporate purchase of our democracy by lobbying and massive influxes of money won’t prosper.  Nor will efforts to prevent gerrymandering and voter disenfranchisement. Above all, I fear that Trump’s dismantling of the efforts to combat global warming will help tip the planet past an irreversible turning point of climate change that will endanger human civilization.  But Luke, to compare Trump to Hitler is facile, distracting and over the top."
"I think that people who complain about those on welfare ought to have to work at Walmart for 3 years and have to support a family of 4.  
Many of the Walmart workers are forced to rely on Food Stamps and food pantries, because the Walmart wages are so low and the conditions so awful.  People lose jobs if then need to stay home with sick children, and little kids in day care get sick often.  
Most people who complain about those on public assistance have no clue what it's like to depend on that money.  
You know, it's curious to me.  On the one hand, the conservative Catholic crowd does not believe in artificial birth control and want access to contraception limited, and on the other does not want to pay to support the mothers and children who don't have enough money to live on."
"The motto and the entire inaugural speech, including the upraised fist was right out of Hitler's Mein Kampf and subsequent speeches after the overthrow of the German Republic by the Nazi party.  The Republican party is now the American face of fascism and Nazism as they prepare to dismantle the governing system in order to install the United Corporations of Amerika.  All performed by Executive Orders and Republican Block legislating while the Democratic cowards join in to protect their Corporate Welfare checks.  The marches were great, but the only thing these fascist creeps understand is removal from power.  Every woman in this country should be following up with notices to their Republican legislators of their recall and removal for every human and civil right destroyed by their own little fists."

"I suspect that rape kits likely to solve rape cases have already been tested.   I further suspect that untested rape kits are untested because DA's have deemed the potential information content to be nil.  At a taxpayer cost of $1300 per test, there need be some critical analysis of whether testing rape kits deemed to have low evidence value is wise.  Those who demand testing every rape kit may find that doing so has the unanticipated consequence of reducing the number of women who have the opportunity to actually have rape medical exams performed.  When DA's know that each rape test must be fully processed regardless of situation and other evidence so as to deplete DA budget, we may see rules governing the administration of rape tests tightened to exclude cases where such tests are deemed low value. 

It would be greatly appreciated if the RG could do a follow-up when the current multi-million dollar testing is complete to see if any benefit was obtained."

"It has the authority. It may happen, especially if the donations to the church keep coming from women. Women are going to want a quid pro quo for their contributions. I personally would not like to see female ordination, but then the church has done things I don't like in other ways, like basically destroying the mass by replacing it with the NO missae. Of course we have the 1962 missal but I don't like that one. Why not just go back to the one before the slaughter, the pre-Bugnini missals? All this ""ordinary time"" stuff is distasteful as well."

"Yep, once women dared to put on shoes, use birth control, and stepped out of the kitchen, they automatically welcomed all manner of assault."
"I think there should be some distinction made between blaming women and asking aloud how women could vote for Trump, which does necessarily mean they had to vote for Clinton. At the end of the day, it was the poor turnout that doomed the Clinton campaign, and that falls just as much on the Bernie supporters whose quest for ideological purity and need to ""feel motivated"" makes me sad to be a Democrat. For Bernie supporters, if you thought Clinton wouldn't be tough enough on corporate America to warrant you to cast a vote, just wait until we get GOP legislation limiting women's reproductive health access, cutting programs targeted to help the working poor, and eliminating the CFPB."
"Ditto my experience - nearly 40 yr in ""high tech"" !
Observations:
- Women do not tend to enter the professional STEM degree stream. Thus the pipeline for promotional candidates is nearly empty.
- Worked with women staff and co-workers to PhD level - no problem but see above.
- As for the sexual harassment mantra - any such off-centre behavior would have resulted in instant dismissal of the perpetrator ( had a case in my group ).
- Lastly - angels fear to tread here: Women are different and have different biological priorities. We are not ""equal"" no matter the social justice warrior slogan du jour. 
My experience over many years:
Women were always treated with respect, but they had different priorities. Perhaps something like 10% made careers in the professional STEM arena, they were certainly not deliberately obstructed, more likely more acomodations were made."

"Bruce Bartlett did not do a poll, he did a survey of the polls you mention where questions about issues where there is legitimate disagreement were phrased from a strictly progressive/liberal point of view. If a conservative site did the same poll with the questions about the same issues were phrased from a strictly conservative point of view, the results would be 180 degrees from the ones you cite. The guy who sold pet rocks became a millionaire, yes he did but did he sell them to idiots? Maybe, I never bought one.

Bartlett also lumped shows such as Hannity and the O'Reilly factor in as news shows. They are not and have never claimed to be anything other than opinion shows. I always thought that Glenn Beck was way out there in a lot of ways. I also think that Hannity gets a bit over the top from time to time. But O'Reilly? He has defended Obama more than even some on MSNBC.

Your comments gave me a good laugh, if it seemed I was questioning your intelligence, I apologize."
"5/5
In that former world, the fact we have free will, meant that anyone who violated those norms, be it extramarital sex or homosexuality, was freely choosing to violate nature. Now, in our current world, when we ask what is “natural” in terms of sexuality, we get very different answers. We are profoundly aware of psychological compulsion, so we are able to distinguish biological sex from sexual orientation, etc., etc.

So our dedication to natural law as a moral guide can be retained re sexual morality, but we understand our sexual nature differently, so we must be open to re-conceive the guidance of the Spirit. Sure, the episcopal magisterium is stuck in the old worldview, but theologians and most educated laity have move forward. Since the Church is all of us, we can and should say that the Church has grown organically primarily in our generation and that of our children and grandchildren.

"""Eugenics"" ?

DuBois proposed the Negro Project to sterilize young black girls to reduce negro poverty.

""Margaret Sanger aligned herself with the eugenicists whose ideology prevailed in the early 20th century. Eugenicists strongly espoused racial supremacy and “purity,” particularly of the “Aryan” race. Eugenicists hoped to purify the bloodlines and improve the race by encouraging the “fit” to reproduce and the “unfit” to restrict their reproduction. They sought to contain the “inferior” races through segregation, sterilization, birth control and abortion.""

"If this is some kind of excuse for what this sadistic woman did to her daughter, the horrific systematical  torture that ended her young life, it falls short. McAnulty was not abused to the point of death, nor were her siblings. There is no comparison. I've been a staunch advocate against the death penalty for many decades. I've stood up in protest for child killers, rapists who've killed,  and people who've murdered multiple individuals, all who were sentenced to death, but I wouldn't protest the execution of this woman. God forgive me, but it's how I feel. To take a life in an instant entails very little time for one's humanity to be struck with mercy. To torture and relentlessly inflict unspeakable pain over years is different.  Her only motive was to inflict unbearable suffering and a slow merciless death on her own child.  I feel McAnulty is completely void of humanity, she's an empty vessel of evil, beyond redemption. I wouldn't fight to save that."

But to the extent that people like you, Lynn Porter, suggest that a Clinton administration would somehow be substantially different in its effects than an Obama administration you distort the truth and are a help to those who would see trump in the Oval office. 
Let's just put it this way: trump doesn't stand a chance unless the 42% of independents decide he does. These are many of the same people that helped Bush get elected in 2000. The friend of my enemy is my enemy."

When pushed they will bring up the horrors of Benghazi and her horrific emails. I doubt they actually care or know much about either. Mostly it's an exercise in regurgitating something they read on facebook or some silly alt-right website to justify the fact that they hate the idea of a woman being president."

"Nice that for your allegations that pro-life people aren't actually pro-life (which I disagree with), you won't answer the question of what those other supposed motivations are... good dodge. And you also won't answer the question about if you could go back in time would you try to convince your mom that she had a ""right"" to abort you, which indicates that your at least pro-life when it comes to your life, but not others.
I do know that Planned Parenthood killing 330,000 or so a year of the unborn is a grave wrong, and that I didn't know (until now) about fertility clinics tossing fertilized eggs doesn't change that. That you knew about somebody being killed on your street but didn't know about somebody killed the same day in another neighborhood doesn't make your neighbor's murder defensible."

"As a hunter and a trapper (above all a conservationist) i have many thoughts on this subject. First of all, depending on the timeframe, the pelt may have been past-prime and should not have been hunted. If there is only two wolves in the area, the hunter should have recognized the lack of ""sign"" and let the wolf live. I am for managing populations, not for the removal of populations. Secondly, as with the rise and fall of all species, the moose population in this region will also return, thus bringing in new wolves. I am curious what happened to the other wolves. Natural die-off or moved out of the area due to the lack of food? Third, I am not sure why we dont have articles written about single mothers not able to feed their children when their dead-beat husbands/boyfriends leave them? If there was an equal amount of outrage for that as there is comments here, we wouldnt have starving mothers or children. Priorities?"

There is a reason the legislature passed the law that lets hearsay come into evidence  in domestic violence cases.  Too many women go right back to the abuser.  

For a lot of different reasons.  Research 'domestic violence' and 'battered women'.  

""In abusive relationships, there may be a cycle of abuse during which tensions rise and an act of violence is committed, followed by a period of reconciliation and calm. Victims of domestic violence may be trapped in domestic violent situations through isolation, power and control, cultural acceptance, lack of financial resources, fear, shame, or to protect children.""

Their blame of the Clinton campaign would be misguided as the reality was that the women came forward who had previously been silent because of the Billy Bush tape which basically had Trump admitting that committing various kind of sexual assault against women is one of his favorite habits.

"For once, Mr. Wohlforth and I stand in complete agreement. Bear attacks make big headlines but only because its so rare and unusual. I had more then my share of encounters and still alive today to write about it. When I used to backpack the Chilkoot Trail, the rangers would tell us about watching out for bears and putting our food on the poles and all that. Bears were least of my problems on that trail.....waiting for the early heart attack had more chances. Bears create hype, like a rock star on drugs! From everything I read, my own experiences, bears are quite an individualist and most really want nothing to do with humans unless you got bacon and beef glue to your clothes. Or appears to be threatening their young ones. But there are rogue bears......just like there are rogue humans. Cancelling Crow Pass race is worthless and meaningless since the risks you have this year, will be the same next year. So why bother? My guess would be: due to fear, not due to safety."

"Wrong. Stay out of other women's wombs. It's immoral to prioritize a fetus over an autonomous human being.  And it's not murder to abort.  Do what you will with your own womb but you and the gov don't get to decide what happens to other women's bodies.  Women do not abort full term babies unless to save the mother's life. You use things that don't happen to justify taking away the human status of all pregnant women.

Thank you for the thoughtful reply.

OK, why?  People fall short in all kinds of ways.  Seems like you are headed toward a 'no true Scotsman' place.

Re:  Maybe the marriage never existed.  Agreed, maybe that's true, but the way to know, within reason, is to submit it to the tribunal (tribunal is not infallible, obviously).

Re:  Pauline/Petrine privileges  Yes, they are unusual exceptions.  I have written before that to me, the Church either needs to go big or go home, so to speak:  acknowledge the first marriage is still the actual marriage, the second union is adulterous, but given the power to bind and loose, the Church 'looses' that (ongoing) sin of adultery.  Not sure it is a good idea, but to me it seems to be the only one that makes sense if one is not going through the annulment process."

Eventually the Church and State went their own way and society flourished.

Totally agree. My vet would never do this either. He will not dock dogs' tails or ears or declaw cats.  Once I came in just at the tail end of an argument with a woman she stormed out. He told me that the owner of a small healthy dog had died. Two months later the woman (who was the daughter of the owner) had come in and told him he wanted the animal 'put down' because she didn't like it and it was a nuisance. He asked her instead to sign the dog over to him. Which she did so with alacrity. The vet knew of an older couple who had just lost their small dog. He called them and they joyfully adopted the little dog. The daughter now shows up demanding he return the dog because one of her grandchildren now wanted a dog and rather than buy one she wanted the old one back. He refused. She threw a fit and said she would sue him. She never did.

Health care providers should cooperate with law enforcement officials and offer the person psychological and spiritual support as well as accurate medical information. A female who has been raped should be able to defend herself against a potential conception from the sexual assault. If, after appropriate testing, there is no evidence that conception has occurred already, she may be treated with medications that would prevent ovulation, sperm capacitation, or fertilization.""

With the large increase of women in the work force one can expect more opting for part time so that there is more time for social activities.

end of excerpts

Corbella refers to the women as innnocents, thus Lepine becomes the evil one. Licia -  privileged, brought up to believe she can be anything she wants, using her position to expound personal views, assuming all normal Canadians come from happy households  - a venomous article."

Do we allow racial discrimination in Slabovia, but continue to provide them federal services from 49 states who think they are repugnant?   How big is your 'community' standard?      

Our growth in communication has tied us together in ways we couldn't have known.  Cultural changes happen much faster than many of us can adapt.
We go into shock when what we thought was normal becomes abnormal, or the other way around.    Some people seek new things, which is great for growth,  Some people seek security and security is good ground for happiness..   There is no right or wrong, they both are needed to keep us in balance."

"A bunch of points....

1) Does this target Islam.  You bet....but not in the way that the bleeding hearts suggest.  It doesn’t target Islam as a religion or it’s followers, rather, it targets something that is inconsistent with societal norms here.

2) It’s very convenient that the author and others like her stir up rabid racial sentiment when what Quebec has done is agreed to by the bulk of Canadians.  It’s ironic that in the democracy that allows  author to complain, the same democratic process can’t be honored when one disagrees with the outcome.    

In the end, issue for me isn’t about race, it’s about safety and societal expectations.   In this country it must be expected that one is identifiable...period....passports, drivers licenses, picking kids up from school....

I don’t give two licks whether a woman chooses (or not) to wear these head dresses in normal day to day life.....but if she’s boarding a plane, testifying in court...etc etc....then she MUST be identifiable.."

"I agree 100%.  We Canadians are generally a very caring people.  My wife and I were skiing in Colorado last winter and while taking chairlifts we met many people from several different countries.  Without fail - every time we said we were from Canada the other women on those lifts just raved about our PM and told us how lucky we were to have someone like him represent our country.  I remember laughing back in 2009 when David Wilkins - the former US Ambassador to Canada - was leaving he commented that we Canadians would miss President GW Bush.  I'm certainly not laughing now!  Hopefully Trump never sets foot in Canada while he is in office.  If he did, methinks that the G20 protests in Toronto back in 2010 would seem like taking a walk in the park by comparison to the protests we'd see then.

"The difference is that those places take the time to truly screen the women who work for them.  The mentality cannot be that of an abused woman who needs alcohol and drugs to cope. 

You have to have an interest in sex and why you enjoy it which is completely different from disconnecting to be able to have sex with a stranger. 

Those women aren't disconnecting in Nevada they are connecting with every single client.  Most have repeat clients.  The business is a family atmosphere and is unique in its qualities and structure.  You have to have real money to get into that place.  

Most businesses don't operate that way.  They are unethical and only care about profits and not the people involved.

As it stands, the overwhelming majority of hate crimes reported in the media are committed by Muslims against other Muslims, Christians and Jews.

"A pro-choice woman can support all view points on abortion. A pro-choice position supports the rights of women to have children or to not have children, without coercion from the state.

"Provide your one or two verses and we can discuss them..

If you accept that Jesus' was silent on the subject of war, you will note that He is completely silent also about the civil authorities. He never defies them and counsels his Apostles to never defy them.

There is nothing contrary to love about defending yourself, your spouse, your children, or your society against an attack.

Yes, He accepted his death because that death was the sole purpose for his being on earth.

Jesus came to fulfil only what was good in the existing law: love of God, love of self, love of life, a just society, and the story of the woman caught in adultery tells no different tale. He even upped the ante, making clear marriage was indissoluble.

So, what in particular renders an action or inaction on your part moral or immoral?

"It's a criminal investigation into Anthony Weiner's email correspondence with a 15-year-old female. At this time, there is no criminal investigation of Clinton. Comey, the FBI director, say the FBI hasn't looked at the emails associated with Huma Abedin and her estranged husband, Weiner. Comey doesn't know their content, doesn't know who they are from or to whom they were sent, whether they are new material or duplicates, or anything else about them.

Comey was irresponsible to write to Congress about a ""new development"" with to little knowledge to call it a development. Furthermore, he is irresponsible to comment in public about an ongoing investigation.  One can only conclude that Comey has done this solely to influence the election for political purposes, just as Comey went beyond his authority to publicly excoriate HRC after finding insufficient cause or evidence to prosecute her for mishandling of classified documents. As the nation's top cop, his responsibility is to known facts."
"When people are angry and lash out, they choose words to degrade and humiliate the other person. Inferring that they are homosexual (fa**ot), a woman (ya p***y), mentally deficient (r****d) or a race that is seen as less accepted in society is not acceptable. Part of it is also that the use of these words is taboo, making them even more hurtful. Scatalogical, genital or the other person's mother don't have the impact of the others. Yes, the terms are insulting and wrong, but until we find words that have the power to hurt, sadly, they're going to get used."

"I worked in the federal prison system in Arizona and another state that was not near the border. The federal prison in Arizona had an illegal alien population closer to 40%. I toured several state prisons in Arizona and they were close to 50%.  There were also INS prisons not directly under control of the BOP which had 100% illegal aliens in detention. 

I knew people who worked in prisons, both state and federal in Texas, New Mexico and California. The population breakdowns were about the same.  Illegal aliens in these prisons are there for violent crimes for the most part, those who are just picked up for illegal entry are not housed in prisons but are in temporary detention centers.

Instead , abortion has become the easy / lazy way out.  Every one of us commenting on this subject are lucky our mom's made the choice they did .The subject hit close to home when my mom told me  that had abortion been easily available in her mom's day , she would be here.

"I wonder what criteria the government uses in order to decide when to intervene in time of a humanitarian crisis.

The Yazidi were entirely ignored by the current government until Michele Rempell, in Oct 2016, introduced a motion in Parliament calling on Parliament to declare  the violence perpetrated against the Yazidi by ISIS as a genocide, and commit to providing asylum to Yazidi women and children.

But had we waited for the current government to introduce a motion on behalf of the Yazidi, we would still be waiting.

One only has to recall that in June 2016, the Liberals (with the exception of four Liberal MPs) voted against declaring the  atrocities committed against the Yazidi  to be a genocide, and found various excuses to make no efforts to provide refuge to them.

How to explain this?  Are they interested in actually helping victims of genocide? Or just interested in keeping a high profile for themselves with a ""hot"" story?"

And if she is financially motivated…..the comfortably retired father-in-law is almost certain to pass before she and her husband do.  A sense of entitlement now might hurt the estate settlement later on.

When manufacturing jobs were lost, it was important to shift the focus of blame from the business interests to other groups who could be scapegoated:  Blacks (code words: crime and welfare fraud), war protestors, uppity women, immigrants...  It's much less uncomfortable to blame what ails one on those who are perceived as being different in one way or another than to place blame on those who one hopes will give one a job."

"Good points made in this comment.......which brings to mind a dilemma I believe faces my wife and I recently retired to our new home in the Okanagan (southern BC).

Considering the accelerating loss of jobs - and not just the stable ones with any sort of benefits package - we now wonder about having chosen the path of being house rich versus cash rich. With all our current 500 thousand eggs in one 'nest' versus the stock market, I worry that when I go to sell this lovely place on Vernon's pastoral edge, whoever will there be to possibly afford the price I will need to continue a comfortable retirement when we reach our seventies and no longer wish to maintain a quarter acre yard, pool, and 2400 SQ. ft. we enjoy?

The accelerating erosion of jobs truly scares me into selling very soon to hopefully catch one of the buyers able to let me access our savings.

Are any of you out there in similar situations and if so, what are your thoughts?"

"1/5
Lesia, that’s two questions really—(1) elaborate on the theory, and (2) apply to gay marriage.

I’ll tackle the first, and either duck or take a limp stab at the second.

If we assume that the Holy Spirit has been trying to guide our theology from the beginning, but that since we are constantly evolving (intellectually, not biologically), she has in fact adapted her message through time to our capacity to understand, then wisdom dictates that we respect past theological positions because somewhere in there is prior divine inspiration. And further, I would argue, the best way forward (that is the way that is most likely to survive into the future with respect) is to strive to identify that trace of the Spirit to be found in our past rather than just throw it out for something new. That is, we should strive to find the thrust, the trend, the movement, the directionality that we presume the Spirit has left throughout our past. 

This gets really complicated in practice."

"It's true that under Oregon law a 16-year-old can't consent, but keep in mind that in most U.S. states the age of consent is 16 or 17.  If the age was chosen arbitrarily, as Oregon's was, it is probably unconstitutional.

In Washington the age of consent is 16.  It is 16 in Canada and Great Britain.  Only two European nations (Ireland and Turkey) have a higher age.  In Oregon it was 16 until some of the law revisions of 1971.   When that revision was made, the chair of the law revision committee admitted that the choice of 18 was essentially political and not based on anything factual.

So we can use the word ""child"" in law, but I respectfully suggest that doing so needs some kind of scientific basis, not just the fact that they had sex on this side of the Columbia River.

For my part, I'll just say that the woman behaved very stupidly and leave it at that.  I hate to see prosecution resources devoted to this kind of case when our communities have so many other problems."
"Abortion is not murder. 

Remember how we've talked about how I used to be an evangelical? I know you believe I must a backslider and was never ""truly"" an evangelical, but whatever. Abortion was the nail in the coffin for me. I was raised in church and told my whole life that abortion is murder (with examples). I held onto this even after I had left the church into my 20s. It took some patient people explaining to me how misguided I was until I realized it. 

You can have whatever opinion you want about when a life begins (Hobby Lobby not wanting to buy Plan B is extreme, but it's their opinion). However, the image you have in your head of abortion doctors ripping living infants out of the womb is a fairytale. There are very rare and extreme (I'll add disgusting) cases where this has occurred but it is statistically insignificant when it comes to these discussions.

When the infant is viable abortion is rare and is performed to save the mother's life. Denying this right is atrocious."

"It is not an issue of contention for a Catholic. Since God is the greatest Good, his will can only be considered intrinsically good, no amalgam of woman, family, and doctors withstanding.

This is one of the basic reasons situation ethics is condemned by the Church.

The Gospels say nothing about fornication. That is because, with minor exceptions such as the divine law on marriage indissolubility, Jesus came to fulfill, not to replace it. The moral precepts of the Old Testament and the Natural Law - including “You shall commit no murder” - remain in full force and vigor."

"Night Owl and windbourne, I'm not sure we know enough of the context to judge the teacher. Based on my own personal experience with a few teachers (as well as the experiences of others), Night Owl might definitely be right. I've seen some tactless, even mean, teachers who seemingly want to hurt their students. Not many, thankfully, but enough for me to entertain the possibility that this teacher's behavior might be totally inappropriate. On the other hand, a fair number of students don't know how to dress; some do wear stuff that's too tight and revealing. It's hard to tell from the photo, but it is perfectly conceivable to me that she might have experienced a wardrobe malfunction. And some girls (and women) don't dress appropriately for a professional context. What if this student had asked about a job or an internship? In that case, some gentle remarks might have been in order. I'm with John 500AF: this is not a Facebook issue. Before we judge, we should hear the teacher's side."

"Freeland is a Ukrainian nationalist who has no problem burning diplomatic bridges at the expense of Canada just to be able to spew vitriol. She has a history for hysterics and lying to the public: Remember her calling her family's Nazi history ""Russia disinformation"", despite the news having come from USA outlet Consortium News, and all the information being confirmed as true - and then Freeland even acknowledged that she had known it was true for over 10 years.
Freeland's grandfather was a pampered Nazi collaborationist, who worked to disseminate anti-Jew propaganda. Freeland's conduct through lies and Russophobic propaganda shows that she has a lot of her grandfather's character within her. Maybe when someone's career is to create and spread hostile lies about other people, the tendency to do that ends up being passed down through the family.
Also, West Ukraine isn't exactly known for being truthful, or for not being neo-Nazis. So, maybe it's partly also a Ukrainian thing."

I am dumping on repubs for not adopting because they are the ones that insist all women give birth when they become pregnant - and I am talking about official party platform here. From what I can find alone, political persuasion does not seem to correlate to adoption. And by the way, when I ask the government do something it is my money as well. So the idea I am asking everyone else to pay for it is not correct. The while idea of a having a civic society is that we pool our money via taxes to accomplish things we could not do individually. That process means sometimes one's money is used in ways one does not support."

"""To you it's obvious that a late-term fetus and a newborn baby are identical. Yet this idea isn't accepted widely.""

I don't know that.  In fact, I think most people who think about it believe there's no relevant difference between those little creatures.  I may be wrong, but I think many people who very strenuously defend Roe v. Wade would also defend the right of the state to step in at the last stages of pregnancy, because they see the equivalency and reject infanticide.  

Your question as to why there were 50 million abortions last year is well put.  I don't know the answer, but that number is staggering.  50 million lives gone at the hands of their mothers.  It's unnatural.

Finally, I agree that ""I should think . . . more about why women get abortions in order to figure out how to save human lives.""  I'll do that, and thank you for the suggestion.  But this doesn't mean abandoning an appeal to reason.  That would be very condescending.

I've  provided a link to CDC reports that zika infection causes fetal deformities in only 6 percent of infected pregnancies, I have pointed out that El Salvador probably doesn't have the imaging to determine those deformities in advance, and I have shown how implausible it would be for a woman who didn't know the condition of her fetus, or likely didn't even know she'd been infected (that is all hearsay) to climb on a plane in her late third trimester to deliver a baby she didn't know was deformed in the US while visiting relatives."

Yet, a significant number of Americans just can't ""let go.""  They can't acknowledge the enormity of their mistake in nominating Trump.  Each day more and more down-ballot Republican candidates are distancing themselves (many of them openly condemning Trump) from him.  I don't blame them, he becomes more toxic each day.  

Indeed, Sunday night's debate will likely be, to a great extent, Hillary reminding us of how ""creepy"" Trump is, and Trump working to convince us that Bill's just as creepy.  I suggest they replace the moderator and bring in Jerry Springer."

"Those thousands and thousands of women nationwide need to convince the US House of Representatives to vote by a two-thirds majority for a Constitutional Amendment (287 members of the House) and also convince the  US Senate to vote by a two-thirds majority for a Constitutional Amendment (66 Senators)  to kill the Electoral College.    

They then need to convince three-fourths of the State Legislatures Nationwide (38 separate States)  to ratify that amendment to get rid of the Electoral College; otherwise, its rules are going to apply in 2020.  

What I think we 'deserve' or you do,  is irrelevant.  That is the system we live under.

That's how thousands and thousands of people got the vote for women in this country in the first place almost 100 years ago.  If you can't do that, following the rules is your only option to get your candidate elected.

"Clinton has spent decades in public service since 1973 to be exact. She deserves to be on that stage tonight as the first women candidate of a major party. And what where you doing in 1973? I was in Boston working at a major hospital clinic providing health care to the indigent and homeless and Hillary was in New Bedford , MA. , not far from Boston, knocking on doors looking for disabled children who had no way to be educated and go to school at the time.  Hillary, a new attorney, chose that instead of a prestigious law firm. These children were not ""mainstreamed"" at all in public schools. I lived that time, we wanted to make a difference and still do. Thanks to those like Hillary my grandson who is 5 is autistic and is receiving his education in a public school with the help of his teachers and his classmates.

"The sperm and ova are alive before they unite to form a fetus. Biologically speaking then life continues and the human species survives as long  as ""life continues in this manner."" Meanwhile, since only one sperm is needed to join with one egg, the rest of the zillions of sperm in an ejaculate simply die even though they are each potential human life. Nature over produces sperm with other animals too  that depend on sexual reproduction like we do,to survive. That is ""God's"" plan. Don't forget  that part of the plan is based on animals eating other animals to survive. That is reality. Its the survival of the fittest through very cruel means, unfortunately. By the way a woman is born with about 500,000 ova. Only a fraction of those potential life units ever unite with a sperm to develop into a fetus. The rest age along as the woman does and die, unfertilized. God, nature, is wasteful on purpose to make sure the species survives. Death goes along with life."

"Our understanding of what Jesus taught us continues to evolve, as new knowledge about biblical exegesis continues and as our knowledge of life and the universe grows.  That is why it has taken 2000 years to develop doctrine to where it is now and to discover that not everything Jesus was teaching us was understood all those centuries ago.  For example, Adam and Eve both had mothers and fathers, the sun does not circle the earth, slavery is evil, but charging interest on loaned money is not necessarily evil.  We also took quite some time figuring out what the seven sacraments are and what the priesthood is.  Perhaps there are more sacraments yet to be realized.  And, we should recognize that we are still working on that ""priesthood"" thing - maybe it is time to go back to the earlier thinking that priests could marry and adopt a new recognition that women can be priests and lead services, as they sometimes did in the earliest church.)

Canada wears other ugly stains i.e  pedohile mass child murderer Clifford Olson, anti-feminist mass murderer  Marc Lepine (Born: Gamil Rodrigue Liass Gharbi) to name a couple.

But one deranged individual with an apparent hatred towards Muslims doesn't imply we have an issue with Islamophobia, any more than we have a problem with mass child- or women murderers.

"Within the past two years, Mason, Trump has bragged that if he wasn't married he'd date his daughter, Ivanka.  What the hell is that all about?  There's a CNN commentator who has a friend who shared her story about what Trump did to her and that was in 2010.  There's other more recent sexual assaults out there that are probably lining up with their attorneys.  Trump's a sexual predator rat.  So was Bill Clinton, but the BIG difference is that Clinton's encounters were CONSENSUAL.  We have Trump on audio bragging about grabbing p___y, and forcing himself on women.  Why?   Because he just ""can't wait."""

"“There’s a lot of data that shows when there’s one woman on the board, it’s much more likely that there will be a second woman on the board.”

What was she trying to say? There can only be a second woman on a board when there is already a first: there are no boards with a second woman and no first woman. Is she trying to say that boards with two or more women outnumber boards with only one? I'll overlook the incorrect use of 'is' with the plural 'data', but I really would prefer some clarity about the basic meaning of her sentence.

"Well the other misconception is that this is strictly a female issue.  When Ric Curtis looked at underage prostitution in NYC, he found that almost 50% were boys.

My post was replying to the observation that the headline specifies she is Australian.

But actually, on that point, no, this event is not on CNN's website as a top twenty story, and as you scroll down on the page, what you find is an article headlined ""When white lives are at stake, society takes notice"".

Notice the absence of the word ""Australian"" in that headline, to get back to the original post writer's point.

"So what this is really telling us is that UH is pretty fiscally responsible, given that Cal athletics outspends its revenue in one year by about the same amount as UH atletics has outspent its revenue over the past 15 years.

The reality is that university athletic programs -- even at the so-called ""power conference"" schools that get paid big TV bucks -- typically outspend their revenue and must be subsidized by the university.  And flagship universities everywhere in the country are willing to pay that subsidy because they understand it's an effective marketing investment.  Successful athletics helps build a school's brand image and increase the enrollment of tuition-paying students, and tuition revenue is a school's financial lifeblood.

Anyone who doubts that athletics helps market a university probably didn't notice that the most-read article in yesterday's online Star-Advertiser was about a UH women's volleyball coach."

Here's a leaked video (they are all leaks). This is what Drumpf and his cabinet do all day. As we all know, talking to Drumpf is futile. Reports have trickled in for the last few weeks. The speculation is over and the truth revealed. Drumpf agrees not to talk, in exchange, gets his cabinet to play with him.

I heard Weinstein, Drumpf, Bill Clinton, Bill O'Really, Drumpf, Bill Cosby, Drumpf and Anthony Weiner are all renting a mansion together. They had a spare guest bedroom, I heard Paul Ryan stayed the night. The pilot on that show is gonna be great!

This shocking video of Drumpf at play, proves he has cabinet members do embarrassing things. Including sexual harassment and, you guessed it, lured an Eastern European woman!

The NDP’s health critic is charging that the Liberals broke a big promise by not including something from their campaign platform in the 2016 budget: a $3 billion investment over four years in home care.

Could this woman not have been a police officer if she was unable to enter a gay marriage? Otherwise, even if his views had been complied with, what would have prevented her from being there?

"I admit it is a difficult question and one's natural sympathy would have to be with the sex slave.
If the actual prohibition is based upon that all sexual intercourse should be open to procreation it is difficult to see how even a sex slave can justify the use of a condom.

Despite this, such is human nature that exceptions that are made for hard cases are quickly applied to 'soft cases'. Catechesis, the teaching of the Faith wherefrom most 'ordinary' Catholics learn their Faith and Morals nowadays comes via the secular media and alas, via headlines and soundbites, most Catholics do not read Catholic publications and the classroom and the pulpit have long since ceased to be where Catholics learn and study their Faith.

Maybe a ranking of sex offender class 1 to class 10 or something. If rape is a 10, and peeing outside were a 1 (without a minor present), I wonder where this might fall. The woman obviously had to be skeeved out, and has her person violated in a clear way, but I doubt even she would rank it a 10?"

"Every once in a while, a few black parents start a ruckus about their kids having to read Huckleberry Finn because the N word is often used in the novel. Their reaction reflects a basic naivete about works of art and context: the use of the N word in this masterpiece is not meant to disparage blacks but to give a snapshot of the insulting ways people treated, and referred to, African-Americans at that time. As a matter of fact, H. Finn is considered to be one of the most anti-racist novels in the history of literature by literary scholars because it exposes the inhumanity of the pre-Civil-War white America and reveals the humanity of Jim. I believe this same principle of conscious or subconscious disregard and misunderstanding of the context is operating in the flap over the use of the N word by Bill Maher. Being too much of a comedian ever-ready for a funny repartee, Maher instinctively reacted to the straight man role of Ben Sasse, who fed him a line he couldn't resist."

I didn't say that I think the Loretta Lynch meeting with Bill Clinton was very suspicious and did more harm than good to Hillary's campaign, but that's what I thought at the time, one of those deals where you slap your forehead and say out loud, ""What were they thinking?""

I probably have the WSJ subscription for about three weeks more. They raised the subscription rat to something like $60/mo, more than I can justify paying. I'm hoping they extend a ""special rate"" to me. Quite a few of those on-line journals do that, for hold-out cheapskates like me. A smart woman told me how to do that."

"Danno, I have been listening off and on this week, and at times in the past.  This investigation is a thorough and thoughtful process.  This past week has been especially interesting - because it is getting down to really seeking what bishops and heads of religious orders have learned and what they think can be done within the church to address the culture that allowed child sex abuse to become a scourge and to be hidden by those in charge.  I think far too many of the big guys still think all they have to do is say ""sorry"" - and ignore a real look at how the world-wide Catholic Church and world-wide religious orders all behaved in the same way.

The change that is needed is huge.  It is not just tweaking canon law here and there, but changing their own minds and hearts on issues that JPII and BXVI promoted - power sharing with laity and women.

Too many current bishops learned to keep their minds and their mouths shut.  But some good ones are coming out now, with Pope Francis."
Obama wrote the book.  He could have left that out but chose to denigrate women instead.
"""My wife ... wait for it ... BREASTFEEDS.""

Your wife breastfeeds.
All women have the capacity to breastfeed.
Therefore, no women has the capacity for ordained ministry.
The logic is beyond dispute."
"An unfortunate headline, except for Trinity and Hobby Lobby. These lawyers also defend Christians who violate law on religious grounds. On some issues they do OK, although on contraception the Administration rolled over after the whole War on Women stunt. Their greatest overreach was in enacting the Parital Birth Abortion Act to force the SCOTUS to reconsider Roe (which was entirely unsuccessful). The only benefit to that saga was to get Trump to mention it and have Hillary answer to rile her base rather than continuing the Obama meme that the law should be adjusted, but there is a law already and that the movement itself was all about elections and not about the unborn. Her epic fail on that question gave Trump pro-life Democrats."
"Are you trying to stalk these women, Herndon?  Do you know that stalking is against ADN policy?  I noticed you haven't disclosed who you represent."
"To begin with I just read your comment and had nothing to do with your former response getting deleted. I certainly don't get offended over matters of taste in regard to the liturgy wars (which I couldn't care less about).

1. I assume you mean by not ""catholic"" the abandonment of a universal language. Shrug. It seems most Catholics appreciate an active role in the liturgy and being able to understand what's being said.

2. <<We know that the new mass was created to get prots into the church.>> We do? Please fill me in on this background.

Since I have self-exiled from the Catholic Church and now attend Episcopal services I concede that the NO and the Episcopal service are virtually indistinguishable, except for the woman priest (HOORAY) and dipping the Eucharist into the wine. Further, the Episcopalians recite the pre-Latinate version of the Nicene Creed, thanks be to God.

By the way, are you a priest?"
"OMG potato potato.  Why so desperate to try and find a time where she wasn't breaking our laws?  You can sugarcoat and justify all day long but in the end she's a felon, here illegally and thanks to one good decision by this Governor should be on her way home very soon.

Lemme guess you'd argue how Ted Bundy helping an old lady cross the street as he's stalking his next victim is somehow a redeeming quality?"
"Nations are built because of beliefs of those who think alike regarding morals and cultural practices that benefit a society. Those who don't like it, do not need to be here. Neither do you, if you wish for your nation to lack the cultural cohesion to continue onward into the future while risking the safety of others. Without this, you have nothing but a post national state that Canada will soon become if the trend on immigration from the Asian region continues in massive waves, where Canada should learn to ""fit in"" to their cultures yet not theirs to ours. If immigrants do not wish to become Canadians at heart, then I have zero sympathy for them. Canada was never a faceless society. And the burqa gets the little girls when they're young. The main purpose of covering the little ones since childhood is to introduce them to their ""modest"" culture that confines women to an obedient and oppressive way of life.

"Heroin is just another opioid in the same drug class as morphine and dilaudid.   It happens to be a wonderful drug for cancer pain and is used for that in other counties similar to how morphine and dilaudid is used here and sold in pharmacies. 

Unfortunately heroin shares the same problems as morphine, dialudid, Percocet, etc.  Unlike cannabis, they are physcially addictive and can kill you.

But in answer to your question, “how do you make an illegal drug legal?” You demonstrate that is is useful for treating certain diseases and conditions without having worse side effects than the disease it’s treating.  Once you demonstrate that, we have a moral and ethical obligation to make that treatment available. 

Currently medical cannabis patients must be seen and evaluated by a licensed physician before being prescribed cannabis.

Out of curiousity, what are your thoughts on morphine, penicillin, and aspirin?"

"The root of the problem is Islamic ideology; much of which is incompatible with the values of modern, liberal democracies. Islamic ideology is based upon the Quran which the vast majority of practicing Muslims view as the direct, infallible, immutable & eternal word of God (as transmitted to humanity via the prophet Muhammad) It is the many instances of violence, bigotry, sexism, homophobia, violence against apostates and the subjugation of non-Muslims that are found within the Quran which serve as the impetus for terrorists and have caused the negative public perception of Islam. The fact that terrorist are able to use this ideology to justify their heinous actions (often with little condemnation from the wider Islamic world) only serves as a reminder of the incompatibility of Islamic ideology with western values.

This opinion piece is no more than the plaintive wail of the dying ideology of cultural nationalism... which hopefully like all nationalism will pass away unlamented very soon.   The fact is that whatever their preferences, the Liberal govt will not attempt to regulate internet service providers like broadcasters... how would this even work: `thirty percent of the emails you sent must be to a Canadian person or company...' `If you watch YouTube, 50% must from Canadian providers...' It is moronic, in other words, and just bec Minster Joly is getting static in Quebec doesn't mean she's `fallen from grace.'  What are you sexist, hostile to women in politics aren't you?"

I was actually happy about the cell phones just in terms of distraction, but I'm not sure I would give PDX that much credit in terms of those turning against him. Several women I was sitting near did not appear amused at some of what was said and it was only less than a week ago where David Crosby had to insult several of the intoxicated to get them to shut up or leave his show in the same venue. The best thing about the show was how genuine a person Dave is and his willingness to empathize with people who have larger struggles. He presented himself with a real human face which was nice. He also seems to have his pulse right on the heart of the country in many ways and I would agree that much of the show seemed improvised or at least loosely structured.

Or are just cherry picking what you want to believe to make you feel safe in what you know?

Have you read about Jamaica where studies have shown that women who consume pot have been proven to have babies who had better Apgar scores, more advanced kids? Yeah, probably not. Nice attempt at a guilt trip. I'm glad you weren't able to abuse my fetus by denying it's mother the right to a safe, effective treatment that helped her eat and drink so she could nourish it, a remedy that probably kept her out of the hospital with feeding tubes, off even worse drugs and IVs.

The tumult that arose at that time from highly-principled but poorly-informed editors gradually died down. It was an attack on nothing less than the human imagination. People can imagine and write about what they want -- just try to stop them! But of course they had better do it well, or the voice-appropriation police will be after them."

"Sanders risks looking like a sore loser with this whole superdelegate conversion thing.  And whining about the party registration rules.  They have existed for a long time and while it's great that more people are paying attention to the nitty gritty of politics, trying to change the rules during the primaries is waste of time and distraction from the issues such as women rights.  Those who earn superdelgate status have been going to meetings weekly and monthly for years, not just in the election season and election year.  Concerned, involved citizens deserve this position, and they are there to do what's best for the party and avoid demagogues. Sanders is a recent convert as a Democrat, he's not giving the party any money (unlike Clinton) and should be focusing his supporters' attention on taking back the Senate rather than bashing fellow Democrats. He's not really a progressive since he won't go up against the big gun manufacturers and the NRA – a huge disconnect."

My Siberian's idea of morning exercise was a 20 mile top speed run across the frozen sound at 20 below. And me cruising along on a snow machine. Some days I'd hook her up and we'd skijor for an hour. When I went to California on vacation I was shocked to see a woman walking a Siberian husky around the block for exercise. 80 degrees! To me that's where the abuse is. But the anti-Iditarod people have their minds made up. It's really more about them establishing their dominance over people they feel are inferior to themselves.

When Palestinians, including West Bank Palestinians claim that their rights have been abrogated in the course of an Israeli action, they are entitled to file suit in Israel.

The other story here, the one they're not telling you, is about how our legal system (and IMO the local press) has failed to protect our community from this creep for over a dozen years.  Now, he's even found a way of manipulating the system for profit.  Is that not a story worthy of the fine journalists at WWeek?

Maybe you'll read the public documents and ask yourself if you believe the system works to protect women?"
"There is absolutely no evidence that women, as a group, ""care for others,"" ""think,"" or ""express love"" differently. All human beings are capable of care, thinking, and love to different degrees but all of these things are constitutively the same. The way people express represent these behaviors has something to do with the way they were raised or their inherent traits, but not gender. The Church has also overstated the differences between the sexes in a way that largely disadvantages women and allows everyone in the room to focus on their lady parts first, a covert way of blocking them from advancing to key spheres of influence."

Ignorance prevailed here, Trump has the right to have his own views and voice them. Will anything become of them, for the most part we hope so - ILLEGAL immigration needs to be fixed. The HOAX regarding the gloom and doom of 'Climate Change' needs to be exposed and 'reproductive rights' are NOT in danger..

Tina your logic is non- existent. . How you can come to the conclusion that one president is in a protective position and one is in a position to assault it ridamdiculous.  You logic is clearly judge people as guilty until charged rather than innocent until found guilty. Maybe you should reconsider your stance on the responsibilities of the president then ask yourself if Trump has committed any injustices to women since he became the president ( 2 days ago).   Keeping someone on your radar is a smart thing to do for sure but to charge them with a crime based on the fear that they may commit. It is scary. Again... all presidents take the same oath of office and are held to the same standards. We all knew Bill Clinton had a past with women but it didn't become an issue until it was one.

(Jason Blum, responsible for the fright ``franchise`` Insidious). Fifty Shades of Grey. I can hear the retching, but wait! This producer was responsible, with partner Kevin Spacey, for House of Cards! (Dana Brunetti, Trigger Street Productions.) The Heat.  Heard of it?  2013 low(er) budget woman-cop movie, Starring Sandra Bullock.  Sounds pretty indie, right? Except that it made 5 times its cost and was produced by Peter Chernin, responsible for (yikes!) Dawn of the Planet of the Apes...

"Koncerned - To avoid devastating rural Alaska, a sales tax would have to waive any shipping expenses from the Lower 48 to Alaska - Also, if you accept  the BASIC  economic understanding that sales taxes by their very nature are regressive, & take the largest per cent of spendable revenue from the poorest, then fairness demands exemptions for most basics - food, clothing, heating fuel, transportation fuel, home maintenance and home improvement items, etc, etc..  The more exemptions you have, the more complex - and expensive - the tax collection system gets. It can be done, but building in fairness gets expensive in both collections and in amount of revenue to be gained. A 01.5% income tax is offset by even a reduced PFD - something NO other State provides. That, plus a first employment tax - what we used to call the school tax-  plus sunset cuts to oil tax credits until the price of oil makes them worth considering again -  would go a long way to stabilizing our economy for all of us."

"Marriage existed long before the Catholic Church--Abraham was married to Sarah before God first called him and before the covenant between God and Abraham.  And marriage is for here on earth (see what Jesus said about the woman with 7 husbands) that in heaven there is no marriage.  And the Church recognizes that it's the two spouses who perform the sacrament.
Marriage is not an ideal.  It is a path of emotional and spiritual growth (oftentimes very challenging)--at the present time in the Catholic Church limited to laypeople.  But Jesus is the Bridegroom (Jn. 3:29)--and a Bridegroom is vowed to marriage.  What does that mean?"
"Thanks for the reply, much more helpful. First, if you are bashing the paper for the articles it prints it serves no purpose.

You'd be hard pressed to find any postings from me showering accolades or blind support. I do think she's got far more good things on her agenda than what the other side has to offer. Which brings us to the last part. Which candidate (ie, liar, cheater, shyster, crook) is worst. I'd say Trump by far. If I weigh what shes done vs what Trump appears to be capable of the scale tips to voting the lessor of two evils. You can call her what you want but under the circumstances there is nothing you can accuse her of that trump hasn't already done. Merely emphasize the seriousness. I'm not proHC by any means. But I am super antiTrump. For all the obvious reasons you read about."
Clearly the sea lion is angry at the girl for causing global warming.
Is running over and killing a woman a manufactured crisis?
She was never an animal lover.  She is a collector/hoarder.  I hope someone shows her what it's like in jail.

They probably coated their hands first with something like Vaseline.  These women will be executed.
I'm curious about these gifted Walker women - it's been awhile since we've heard from either about the other. Have they found a way to connect?
"It apparently shows that this group agrees with trump when he condones sexual assault of women, and agree that grabbing women by the p*ssy is perfectly acceptable. It's truly bizarre that anyone would agree with trump's values of racism and sexism. When a group agrees with these values, coming from a clueless and narcissistic moron, it shows the intelligence level of the entire group. To think that Donald Trump knows anything about Christian values is a joke. Once again, he brings his BS to whatever crowd he happens to be talking to that day. These are the people that fell for his lies, and agree with his twisted values, and why our country is on the verge of a disastrous war."
"""Seriously, though, WHY are they still giving this woman airtime?""

To be cruel."
"Viva La Hillary. Ebba, ebba undalay.  Women, blacks, Hispanics, Mexicans, Latinos, and a whole lot of Republicans and billionaires for Hillary.  Woot, woot."
"The book provides both the question and the answer on the cover.

Just a Whinefest, from what I've read about it,  by a woman who can't put on her big girl undies and take responsibility for her actions.
But then, that is one of those ""defining characteristics"" of those on the Left, isn't it?  An inability to accept personal responsibility for their words and actions."
"It should be pointed out that the decision to base legislative representation on population, but to count slaves at a discount, was an attempt to limit the legislative power of the southern states where slave holding was prevalent, not a comment on the essential humanity of slaves themselves.  The latter was clearly dealt with when slavery itself was allowed to continue.  

Sixty percent was the result of a compromise between northern interests who held that, if slaves were property, they should not be counted at all (except  for purposes of assessing the wealth, and thence the taxes owed, of the states) and the southern states that held that they should be fully counted for representation purposes (even though they --  like women-- could not vote), but not at all for taxation purposes.  

Regardless of his other points, Caplan seems to me to be correct when he identifies black/white race relations as the defining thread in U.S. domestic history."
Of course it takes two to tango . But it's the woman's total responsibility to not get pg .  It's pathetic that these protest organizers told women who aren't pro choice to stay home .   If I'm short on gas---I walk and don't drive. If a woman doesn't have the money to buy birth control she shouldn't sleep around. How much simpler does it get  ? Women demand to be in charge of they're bodies---so be in charge and don't say yes when you should say no.
"She's right about one thing, America should not be involved in regime change wars in the middle East.
Let the Sunnis and Shiites fight over Syria. It's little more than a proxy war between Iran and Saudi Arabia to decide which crazy sect of Islam will control Syria. 
Russia can keep selling arms to Iran, while we sell to the  Saudis. Win-win"

wow"
"Maybe why so many dislike trump is because he speaks what many are just afraid to say but have always thought.  Why is it so wrong to be bluntly out there lay it out honest.  The U.S. citizens became this pariah of political correctness, so afraid to say what they really want to say or think because so afraid of one person getting offended. How about just not giving a damn anymore like we were at one point in this country many moons ago and just lay it out there baby.  Who cares who gets offended and why should we care?  Who really cares?  I don't.  And do I want to see a woman leading this country, maybe but no way in hell would I choose the current woman candidate.  To me, that's just contemplating suicide and going through with it casting a vote for her."
Odd that they chose Ms Gregoire to talk about objectification of women in the media and advertising when she allowed herself to be photoshopped for a magazine cover in Fashion magazine.

""Teen admits killing Florida woman in stabbing rampage near British Museum in London""
""The incident raised fears of terrorism, but police said it was not considered a terrorist attack.- Prosecutors said Bulhan was suffering an “acute” episode of paranoid schizophrenia at the time.""
Trudeau immediately declared a terrorist act against Islam, he didn't wait for authorities to decided the accused was also probably suffering an acute episode of paranoid schizophrenia at the time."
"I don't think it was an article about both sides...it was THIS woman's story. Good job, Julia!"
"Or in the case of Talib, self inflicted crime. Such a great role model for all to see. He's kneeling for all the injustice in the world including women's rights, while he is shooting himself at a strip club and his buddy Von is making a sex tape. Power to the people, er NFL players."
If there was a team in my city I would go to games with my daughter. As it is we watch the local university's women's team which is good too.
Just as the Inquiry in Murdered and Missing Native Women is collapsing this new scandal of cultural appropriation comes along to fill the shame void . This is going to be a great new tool to leverage more millions out of guilt stricken white people. Excellent timing.
"It shows that he is scummy.

Besides.....it's 11 women, not just 1 or 2.  Still not a for sure, but I tend to think it is very possible if it is a large number of women coming forward.

How's 5th Avenue?"
"Your toxic partisanship blinds you to both reason and nuance. Shooting people of a particular faith to make a point IS an act of terrorism. 

Eschewing the term ""barbaric cultural practices,"" which was favoured by the previous regime, is a conscious choice to avoid carelessly perpetuating the bigoted connotation that all Muslims either practice or support female genital mutilation (they don't by the way, in case that's news to you).

While I am no Trudeau supporter, he was indeed ahead of the curve in talking about ""root causes,"" which are now being studied carefully to understand the process of radicalization."
"Those statistics also apply to native women. . But  the perpetrators, 82 %who  know and live with  the missing and murdered  women,  remain unnamed,  uncharged, and unwanted at the inquiry."
"Sad column. All kinds of women call Justin Trudeau ""hot"" and don't receive public criticism from a federal cabinet minister. Also sad that a federal cabinet minister would feel she has any place to comment on what a comedian has to say. Perhaps like the MP who pushed the anti-Islamophobia bill, they feel that once they are elected they are in charge and can dictate what everyone else can and cannot say. Shades of China or perhaps Iran. It was an off-colour joke by a comedian known to ad lib adult oriented content. Try to restrain your criticism."
"I agree.  Oops, looked at a woman with sinful thoughts.  Gotta go rip out my eyes.  Direct, clear words, you know.  Must be taken literally!"
A recent article in this paper stated that all prospective immigrants do not get a face-to-face interview. I found that surprising and disturbing. Does that explain why there are women in Canada wearing face coverings?
"Do we really need a president who has no self-control? A time analysis of speaking last night would heavily be in favor of Trump, even though answers were to be timed. Not once or twice, but throughout the debate, he interjected, interrupted, and went far over his time limit. This speaks to character. His self-admitted assaults on women--- he is so oblivious to what constitutes civilized behavior--- that he took days before being convinced it was a serious character flaw he needed to disavow. 
At this point, Trump supporters need to take a long, hard look in the mirror. 
Would you trust him to be around your wife, sister, daughter? 
Do you think a billionaire entertainer, who is unable to point to ONE unselfish act in his 68-years, is qualified to lead this great nation?"

"If the RG has no right to comment because of the Shurtz case, then you have no right to comment on women. Your history of blatant misogyny disqualifies you."
"Maybe 'God' is having another wager with Satan like he did about Job and instead of  Satan taking everything away from a 'Godly' person, Satan gets to give Trump all the goodies instead!

"Take it from someone who obviously has a closed mind. We can always point out some good things that have been done, but you can't deny what not so good has been done too. Please explain how polygamy and marrying young girls, as the Mormon church has done, was not you say what I think it was for. Please enlighten. Wait...how is the Mormon church only using the KJV version of the Bible when in the Mormon scriptures it says God lives in on the planet of Kolob? So this is in the KJV version of the Bible?"
"It's not religion, it's culture. Muslim women in many countries wear whatever they want. And they did so in many Middle Eastern countries before the recent radical turn."
"The incident in Halifax involved a taxis driver taking advantage of an intoxicated young woman passenger, so intoxicated that she had passed out. Halifax is a university town with a  bar scene that caters to that market so there are ALWAYS  lots of intoxicated young woman taking cabs at night.
The wider issue in this case is that the courts have been lenient with migrants committing serious crimes. If this chap had been found guilty he would have  faced a deportation hearing and the Judge,  of course, would know that. 
Halifax is no different than anywhere else in Canada in the sense that the political class and their supporters as well as the mainstream media favours  wide open immigration from the  large pool of migrants available from a myriad of failed states and third world utopias. The problems associated with the accompanying culture clash are being glossed over and criminal activity is going under reported because of this. Fortunately this case is being widely scrutinized."
"I've worked in claims processing in a previous life and if 100% of submitted claims all paid out, that would mean you could have orthopedic surgeons charging the state for root canals - and getting paid! Any claims system worth its salt should never pay 100% of all claims submitted."
Too many white women.

Oops, you validated every women who stayed around today to help society instead of trying to tear it apart with your hate...."
That's is what the article says too but since it was women who wrote it it just blurs by your blinders. IQ is mostly genetic.
"KS,
I prefer Dr. Schwab's interpretation of those bible verses to Ms. Bachmann's. I do not believe he ever claims that his opinions on biblical interpretations or political issues are anything except his opinions. 
In my observation, Trumpet lies more than any politician in memory. And, when he is proven to be a liar, he never apologizes or admits his lies. Merkel knows more about the EU than he knows about being a real estate mogul in my opinion."
I had an encounter with a female moose in Alaska last year but there were no babies involved and it was just a non-event. I DID check to see where the nearest tree was though. These animals are far larger than you understand until one is 20 feet from you.
Good luck to our Canadian women today.  We're proud of you !!
"Just reading a Scientific American article that claims deaths from alcohol related crashes are under reported nationally. While not characterized as a conspiracy it does suggest the under reporting would tend to reduce the degree of concern associated with this serious problem. That this poor woman was innocently impacted not once but twice, the second ending her life should be a warning cry to the profoundly negative impact of alcohol abuse. Already were hearing the negative impacts of the just opened liquor store in Bethel when more stores were proposed. This is a profound failure of leadership. While toughening penalties for these offenders may produce short term benefits there remains a huge chasm between the connection  on the part of young people to the realities of drinking to the point of impairment and jumping behind the wheel of thousands of pounds of moving metal. When they ""wake up"" in jail ,their lives and the lives of their innocent victims changed forever  what then?"
"I guess we can get rid of all those NGO's and taxpayer supported organizations that have been promoting girls and women to take science and technology for the last 30 years, because clearly they don't work."
"I don't object to EWTN interviewing the likes of Gorka; I object to the cozy relationship between them and especially to the fluffy interview.  At one time, Mother Angelica exercised a personal veto over guests and topics who appeared on any EWTN programming. She permitted no discussion of Catholic social teaching and no guest -- including bishops -- who were associated with the social teaching of the church.  I don't know who exercises the veto now, but I'm confident that the tradition lives on.  I suspect that Cardinal Cupich, Bishop McElroy and Cardinal Tobin are all 'personnae non gratae' at EWTN. EWTN will sooner or later formally link to Breitbart; perhaps they've already done so."

"Alceste: I must admit - though no doubt it is self-evident - that your Old Auntie routine of consistently smug, condescending, SJW comments and contrarian reactions on just about every subject has become extremely tiresome extremely quickly. With that as preamble, I must observe that:
1.  bringing Trump into a discussion - where did THAT come from? - about Canadian society 
2.  saying that you 'doubt' that the writer ""believes"" what she said about rape culture
3.  splitting hairs like some sort of armchair legal beagle...""I didn't say...""occur"" I said ""tolerated"". Right, and Clinton didn't have sex with 'that woman' just because she felted him. And Hilary didn't lose because she and her partner in crime are perceived as hypocritical, lying...hey wait a second, who said anything about Hilary? Well, on this Thanksgiving Weekend what's sauce for the goose (Bill) is sauce for the gander (Hilary) - and the turkey.  No not you silly billy, Trump!"
"Obviously he won't get the chance. It won't even be that close. 
No, Donny's going to get slammed to the ground by Hillary--it will be supremely beautiful to see his elephantine ego crash from such a stratospheric height while at the same time seeing the Republican party's laughable political hopes dashed. My Goddess, it's going to be so unbelievably funny.  
On a serious note though, Trump should take a japanistic approach to the shame and utter humiliation of his defeat at the hands of a woman."
"Dogma, like orthodoxy, is credal. We are not judged by our beliefs, by the way, but our charity and that is what the Church believes. The essential belief is the resurrection. Everything else is pub conversation on theology or ethiccs, which has been off-track since Augustine's neo-platonic asexualism. Any convert who does not know that there is some contention in the Church on sexual issues from birth control to ordaining women has not been paying attention, but they come anyway. I pity those who came because we don't ordain women, because in a generation we will be."
What a heart warming story. I have watch Bridget on TV and new straight away that she is an extraordinary women. Please never give up the work that you are doing now. South Africa needs you. We all thank you. You are remarkable..
"Pat Perrielo writes: ""We understand that Africa or Asia may have a different view of women. We try to understand their culture and make some allowances for it."" 

And yet Asia has had a majority of women presidents to date - Muslim majority countries (Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia), Buddhist majority countries (Sri Lanka, Taiwan), Hindu majority countries (India), and even a Catholic majority country - the Philippines! Indonesia stipulates a minimum of 30% women candidates in elections. Asian Catholic women doing theology as deep and as radical anywhere meet, share and publish every two years (since 2002) in the ""Ecclesia of Women in Asia"" network (EWA). Women religious tend to belong to one of two extremes - dutiful practitioners within a clerical church (a minority), or long term feminist engaged with the marginalised (a slowly increasing majority of Sisters). Yes, we remain patriarchal churches within patriarchal societies, yet the ground is shifting beneath our feet. Thank God!"
"If we'd put United Fruit Company back in charge of Central America those people could all stay home. They'd have jobs, law and order, hope for the future. Some groups are incapable of governing themselves. As for the Thai woman who's already been found guilty of PFD fraud, kick her out. We can afford to be choosy."

"Taken directly from the article which you apparently did not read.

""Castro said that as the woman approached the 1999 GMC Sierra truck in the parking lot, the truck began moving toward her.  ""

"In Palestine it is said that the sheep followed the shepherd, perfect imagery for the followers of Christ, the Good Shepherd who doesn't exploit His sheep: He died for them.
These sisters think that they can set up a Vatican II Rite equivalent to an Eastern Catholic Rite. This Rite apparently will ordain women, allow same-sex marriage, divorce and remarriage and a host of other nom-Catholic practices all with the blessing of the Roman Pontiff. Can you see this happening?"
"Anyone criticizing this Administration's and States non-response to illegal and un-vetted individuals into our state, and the subsequent harm and cost associated with that policy, are not ""hateful."" We have every right to demand such processes and transparency without people such as you equating such response with support for any given political candidate.

Just curious: if anyone takes issue with this failed President, do you feel they're racist for doing so?  If anyone doesn't want to vote for the female running for office, are they misogynist?  If you do feel that way, it would help explain a lot about your mindset on this."

"I agree. I claimed this credit for my wife who bused downtown to work and I claimed the employment tax credit for both of us. My wife would have taken the bus with or without the tax credit so it achieved nothing other than to lessen government revenues! I think that Morneau should have ditched the employment credit too as it makes absolutely no sense and just clutters the tax return. An unemployed person has limited income and is taxed correspondingly less, why give a person a tax break simply because they have a job? The thinking seems to be something along the lines: ""people aren't working because they're lazy, maybe if we provide a tax break if they got a job, the lazy so and sos would get off the couch"". Only very low earners would need the credit and they could be accommodated by adjusting the tax brackets if necessary because they were somehow paying tax. I certainly found it ludicrous when I was earning $120K to get a tax credit on top!"
"You are ending the conversation, not me.  We still have to discuss Ordinatio Sacerdotalis in detail. It is by no means a dogmatic definition of revealed truth about the divine constitution of the Church.  We also have to discuss some  mysterious ""underlying theology of the Eucharist"" that apparently you cannot  find in the Catechism of the Catholic Church.  We have barely started sharing about St John Paul II's Theology of the Body.  We still have to explore many other issues, such as the linkage of Mary, Christ, and the Eucharist.  This is not a zero sum discussion, I am not trying to convince you of anything.  It is a fraternal dialogue/debate to listen to each other and enrich each other.  See Acts 15 for a good model to follow.  Do you really think we have already reached 15:28 with regard to the ordination of women?  I don't believe so.  However, if you are not willing to continue this dialogue, peace be with you."
"You are apparently incorrect concerning why the maternal and infant death rates have risen.....according to published reports, it does not seem to be because of ""worsening poverty"" - 

""...""Certainly, maternal death is still a rare event,"" the study's lead researcher, Marian MacDorman of the University of Maryland, said.....Nancy Chescheir, MD, the editor-in-chief of Obstetrics & Gynecology, weighed in with a few reasons why maternal death rates might be so high these days: Women are having babies later in life, obesity rates are higher, and diseases like diabetes and high blood pressure run rampant. Women are simply going into pregnancy with more risk factors than before, which could certainly affect these rates of maternal death.""

"Who is the ruler is actually pretty irrelevant to the status of ordinary women. The women in Christian countries have always had much more freedom and equality than those in Muslim countries.

"Infallibility is definitely a topic that we have to talk about. We might, for instance, want to ponder whether V1 was a free council? If not, a case can be made for questioning its conclusions. We might want to talk about how non-conciliar understandings of infallibility are at the very heart and core of the phenomenon of the modern Catholic Church being split rather violently into traditionalists and progressives at all levels. We might want to talk about how Ratzinger abused the concept of ""ordinary magisterium"" to draw the false conclusion that it is infallibly true that we may not ordain women priests. 

This is an awful lot to talk about here, most of it in one way or another implying that V1's definition of papal infallibility is beyond doubt one of the most fooling things bishops in council have ever done."

Don't complain if ""Satan"" or even ""Baal"" proselytizing begins to occur. May the coolest religion with millennia-old roots win on a level playing field, ne? We'll be building temples to Artemis in no time, sisters. Or maybe secular public schools aren't the best places for evangelizing or otherwise. Well, it seems that's already been decided, now let's make it pluralistic. Kids are so darned impressionable, I hear."

"Nora,
Many RCs don't understand that the term ""Roman Catholic"" refers to a Rite within the Catholic Church and is not the name of the entire universal Catholic Church.  I am sure that Jim meant no harm or disrespect.  
But the fact is that the Eastern Churches (including the Ukrainian) that have married priests are part of the Catholic Church.  Somehow, these Churches have not disappeared, nor have been destroyed by thunderbolts for having married priests.  So, it is completely possible for the Latin Rite to follow our example and have married clergy.
Unfortunately, we do not have women priests, because that is forbidden by Canon Law that obligates us as well........
I often think that God musy shake her head at human folly regarding the myriad rules, just as mothers often shake their heads at the folly of silly children who insist that this or that just must be so....."

Note to Mayor:  If you are looking for new revenue, how about taxing the squatters who live next door to me? As you know squatters have been living in the house next door to mine ever since the owner died one year ago. According to the AFD, one of the squatters is charging rent to other squatters. Doesn't this seem like a revenue stream you might want to consider?  Some squatters don't stay long, so it would seem that the bed tax should apply to at least some of the squatters I have seem come and go? It is past time for you to address the developing problems involving squatters in Anchorage FINALLY!!"

Pls research methods of mass propaganda; Edward Bernays; & how PR agents can manipulate people as a means of achieving some larger agenda that supports their interests at the cost of your well-being -- i.e. Bernays was hired by Big Tobacco to get women to smoke:  On Easter Sunday he got women to march down Fifth Ave in Easter finery, smoking cigarettes.  It became chic.  Sales soared.  The cancer did not come until later.

Same with Women's march -- you were seduced to join a mob, and now you are defending the mob's vacuous non-agenda, while real issues, like prosecuting Clinton for deliberate destruction of Libya & Syria & deaths of 200,000, becomes invisible.
 
REAL women support Tulsi Gabbard who visited Syria and interviewed 14 yrs old raped by ISIS, which US arms & supports. 
Now,  ""Congress disgusted w/ Gabbard."" Google it.
Will you come to the defense of Tulsi Gabbard?"
"Not even collusion-ey.  The FEC has clear rules when it comes to soliciting foreign help or consultation with any campaign in America, including the Presidential. Read it, Ms. Parker and weep.  Looking for dirt? Yeah?  Like the dirt campaign against Trump just before election day, when several women coming out of the woodwork, as if on cue, to accuse Trump of sexual harassment?  They came and went like a mist. Of course it was arranged.  Duh.... Backroom politics. Collusion?  Ask Hillary Clinton about CNN operative, Donna Brazille and her ""debate questions""? And why CNN had to fire her? And ""only"" after the WikiLeaks came out  Ask John Podesta about the behind the scene moves to ""fix"" the primaries against Bernie Sanders.  If not for his e-mail account getting hacked, we'd never know about that either.  Or ask Bernie Sanders, as you'll never get the truth out of Podesta.  Collusion-ey?. No, just another red herring to feed a ratings hungry press. Those that fall for it anyway"
Feminism is a hate group by any rational standard. Feminists are hateful people.

"War on women...Hmmm...women in America DO have the right to use birth control. If, God forbid, a rape occurs, the rapist is prosecuted (hopefully) by a jury of his peers. This is not some country where the rapist goes free while the woman is stoned because of his actions. Women in America cal be educated, can hold office- even the office of President, they can be doctors, lawyers or even just a wife and mom (probably the most important job of all.) Women in America have so many rights that are lacking in countries headed by Muslim extremists. Maybe instead of acting all smug, we all need to remember how it was here about 120 years ago and what we have now--and be grateful for it."
"And yet not one of these imaginary assaulted women has come forward.  Trump talks, but he's no Bill Clinton."

But you keep changing the subject from women to terrorism, why is that? I am concerned with the erasing of women from public space, gender segregation, etc. THAT extremism. I want Muslim columnists to be clear on their views on women, not terrorism."
"She not woke, She dumb!"
"""Why did you vote for Trump?"" Apparently the answer is ""abortion and all things abortion related."" OK, I get it. You don't like abortion. Are there other things you don't like, things your Catholic conscience simply cannot support? Sure there must be something. 

""The mainstream media, including progressive Catholics, think we are — like President-elect Trump — intolerant, racist, and misogynistic."" I'm not that interested in what others think. What do you think? If you vote for a racist are you racist? If you vote for a misogynist are you misogynistic?  If you promote Islamophobia, homophobia, xenophobia, are you culpable for all those things? You should at least consider the possibility that in your zeal for purity on the abortion issue you voted for a candidate who is seriously, morally stained on other issues and by casting your vote for him you take on a part of his moral deficiency. You could have cast a protest vote, or refused  to vote at all, but you didn't. You voted--badly."
"Lynn:  We're on agreement that we very inadequately fund community mental health resources.  I only support closure and transition to a women's prison because a) it should release ten million dollars more which could be redirected to community services and b) a women's prison is going to be opened and the JC facility would be a good place for a ""model"" program with many of the services we now see at Sponsors.  It would be a tremendous opportunity to pilot programs which addressed transition services for young women.  

Thank you for the compliment on the article.  Again, while we agree and sometimes disagree on issues, I do respect and appreciate your dedication to needy Oregonians.  If you'd ever like to sit down for coffee and a visit, I'd enjoy it.  my regards, Gary Crum"
"Sigh...

She did sin--unless you mean to suggest that the same God who taught us ""Thou shall not commit adultery"" no longer has a problem with adultery.  

The women sinned.  What do you make of ""Go and sin no more?""  I mean I guess you will probably respond with ""Well, scholars aren't sure Jesus actually said that.  It might be a later interpolation by a Q redactor with an ax to grind"" or something equally ridiculous you pulled from Ray Brown or other ""scholar."""
"In Saudi Arabia, the most radical Wahhabist state in the world, where full-length chadors with niqabs are de rigueur, women have their passport photos taken — in every case, showing their full face. How then could anyone legitimately claim that they cannot lift it to ride a bus?"
"I agree Jerry...  The pollsters are all-in on trying to keep him down.  The only problem is, the MSM polls at 3% favorable, and Congress at 6%.  So If Trump is polling at 35-40% he is up to ten times higher than they are!  

The fact is, Trump is at about 50% or higher.  They won't tell the truth, just like they acted in the election where they over polled women and democrates by 15-25%.  It all caught up to them when the election was over.  The word now is that the head of CNN is about to be fired because of the destruction of that network and they way they do business.  Trump is draining the swamp, and it shows!  
Trump is doing a great job on the hurricane and he is all over that.  He also pardoned Joe Arpaio today, who has 55+ years of service in law enforcement, and who was just doing his job.  Arpaio will come out with a TON of stuff on Tuesday he said tonight.

If the Catholics want to boot GSA and not host GSA events and activities, that is their prerogative.

If they want to believe something and be wrong (gee, it's not like THAT'S never happened before), let them. Take your meetings and functions somewhere else and move on.

"Harvey Weinstein has been tried and convicted in the Public Court. What happened to innocent before guilty? (Oh hello Media?)

Trump is 'convicted' on just 'she said'-

Consider, carefully, this from the cousin of a woman accusing Trump of groping her-
-
""I can only imagine that Summer’s actions today are nothing more than an attempt to regain the spotlight at Mr. Trump’s expense...""

[snip] John Barry of Mission Viejo, Calif. who said ""Summer Zervos is making the allegations to get back on reality television.
""I am completely shocked and bewildered by my cousin, Summer Zervos, and her press conference today. Ever since she was on The Apprentice she has had nothing but glowing things to say about Mr. Trump” ...
Barry said that Zervos frequently described Trump as kind and an inspiration to her professionally, and that she “converted her friends and our family to become Trump supporters.”
“That was until Summer invited Mr. Trump to her restaurant during the primary and he said no..."""
"So  if I was censored, it MUST be because I was ""uncivil"" and must have angered *moderates*, it can't be because there are, in fact, several people here with extreme definitions of what is acceptable? Using ""witch-hunt"" and ""extreme leftist fringe"" in response is ""uncivil"", that is a moderate position? 

The theme is whether the CPC should ""lose the anger"", because only some fringe would respond, and I am responding with why at least one normally non-CPC voter is listening. Because it IS about Free Speech and the I word.

As for what was censored: saying one can see how the *I* word would be interpreted from what gets censored here. Period. Quite inflammatory stuff, huh?

Was threatened with banishment for approving as civil a mildly worded comment about how women are happier at home in a traditional role, etc. I voted no to is this a good comment, but yes to is it civil. Threat of banishment if I did it again!

Is this uncivil by any reasonable standard?"
"What if Biden, Kaine, Pelosi, and Kennedy are right about abortion and Chaput is simply wrong? What if God trusts women to make the difficult decisions about their pregnancies without interference from the State? I think if a woman approached Jesus and said, ""I'm pregnant and I don't know what to do,"" I think Jesus would say, ""I trust you to pray and make the right decision."" 

Why is that not Catholic?"
"Since Saudi Arabia, the subject of the cartoon, does not provide equality for women  as a matter of law and the  theocratic law of Islam, it is fair comment.

They only last week decided women could drive cars in their country."
"Did you ever watch The Sopranos?    Tony's mother, Livia Soprano, is a borderline personality disorder.   Nothing but malice ever came out of her mouth.    Nothing was ever good enough for her.

"The Church’s historical gender imbalance has so fundamentally undermined its credibility for providing perspective or teaching regarding sexuality, sexual intimacy, sexual abuse and victimization that it has relegated itself to the sidelines of relevance. It isn’t seen any longer as a fit moral educator or guide since it’s foundations bear the clear signs of fracture that come from the absence of meaningful and powerful roles for women at all levels of Church society. That coupled with the duplicitous actions of  Church authority regarding child abusing clergy leaves one wondering what the Church could say in lieu of silence that could help advance relevant, instructive, just and supportive outcomes indicative of genuine renewal."

"So your reason for voting for the Trumpster even though he's inarguably a morally deficient, pathological liar, who bragged about sexually assaulting women is because you think Bill Clinton was as well. That is absolutely the most unintelligent line of reasoning ever. Are you in the sixth grade, or what?"

She talks about being ashamed of the person she used to be but the defense says drug use was a motivating factor. You can't buy drugs with credit cards or bank accounts. This took sophistication, and shopping sprees at different retailers has nothing to do with drug addiction. If the prosecutor and judge bought that they're way too far gone for redemption. She was a grown ass woman. A young child knows stealing is wrong. This is a joke and an insult to the victims."
"If you have to ask what my point is, you will never understand it. Because you did ask, I have difficulty believing that you do sympathize with the girl I was speaking of. Incidentally, she had to have a hysterectomy because of her botched abortion."
"You are making a false equivalence in the presidential race between Trump's behavior and Hillary Clinton's which is illogical and frankly, rather tacky. President Obama is a saint to some less than astute political observers but the reality is he has had to make compromises and has played with the devil just like any other American president. He looks squeaky clean but he isn't. Maybe you could imagine what you would do if you were running for president (in a woman-hating society) as the first woman candidate with a real shot at becoming president and your opponent is a racist, misogynist Cheeto Jesus like Trump who has lowered the standards of political debate like no other candidate in the history of the nation."
"This reflects some comments I heard from some young Polish Catholics: that they believe in the Catholic faith but not in the Catholic Church. That's very revealing coming from such a staunch Catholic country as Poland.

In para 3, Bishop Tobin states: ""For starters, a high number dropped out because they are unhappy with the church's teaching on sexuality — abortion, homosexuality and birth control."" Note the order he put them in. I think the priorities for young people should be the reverse order. One of the major mistakes made by the Hierarchy and ultra-conservative Catholics is to assume that anyone who is pro birth control is also pro-abortion. It does not follow."

 To further address your profound ignorance. My Chickasaw mother grew up in abject poverty in a one room dirt floor shanty. She worked her butt off all her life to get  good education, and as a pioneer in the field of occupational nursing more than paid her dues. She retired at the top of her field having ran several medical departments, responsible for the immediate health are of over 35K blue collar workers. She earned every penny she made, and that you belittle these people with psychobabble propaganda for sheep to graze on, shows just how intellectually bankrupt you are, but expected after reading your repeated ignorant posts."
"RIP, my friend.
Although we knew each other from attending Tukwila Schools, a friendship grew as we met often for coffee at the HUB while attending the UW.  Steve spent time in Alaska after graduation from Foster, where he met his beautiful wife, Bonnie.  
We spoke often about future Tukwila annexations.  Living outside our city, he often joked about the inevitability, and questioned ""Why?"" he would ever want to live with people of our ""type"".
How things changed.  Tukwila took on the responsibilities involved in a rapid growth, and Steve became deeply involved  in seeking solutions to complex matters."
"What's interesting in your assessment is that very argument was used by the artistic community in Helena, Montana concerning a fountain commissioned by the Daughter's of the Confederacy.  This fountain was one of three monuments constructed by Confederate sympathizers west of the Mississippi...excluding Texas. It was taken down today because the majority in my little city finally realized that the money their ancestors gave to these women to fund that fountain also went to support the KKK.  It's a shame on one hand because it was the only public fountain in town, but on the other hand, Montana has it's own legacy of racism in targeting Native Americans.  So, in the end we said 'no' to racism of any kind being memorialized in our public parks.  Personally, I wish the city had redesignated it, but that might still happen some day down the road when they bring the fountain out of storage, as it wasn't destroyed."

"Factual information is self-validating.

The most glaring example of Black Privilege is that which is enjoyed by Barack Obama. He is at best an incompetent fool, with the most secretive administration ever...... but his Black Privilege status keeps him from being described this way by the PC media.

Black Privilege demands that Black rappers who sing the dirtiest, foulest words about women and killing police officers are celebrated as “artists"" ..... even at White House parties hosted by the Obamas.

One of the major appeals of Barack Obama was his promise to unify people, that he had a record of working with people from the other side.  In a famous speech, he proclaimed that there are no blue states or red states, there is only the United States.  He also consciously implied that he could  reconcile the racial conflict, especially since he is half white and half black.  Lies.  America is way more divided now than when he was first elected.

"You were lucky then. I grew up in both a small town and rural area of southeast MO, where the Ozarks met the Mississippi River bottoms. If you weren't WASP you were ignored at best and you don't  want to know the at worst.  My third grade school teacher was my Catholic godmother. My fifth grade teacher taught us about the evils of the Catholic Church and how it killed god fearing real Christians for reading the Bible and led prayers asking that we all come know Jesus. amen. There were at least three Catholic kids in that class.  In high school my advanced French class was made to sing a rather nasty song about a monk who broke all of vows and the various ways he did so.  Crosses were still being burned in the country and a barn or two as well. The neighboring county where my family came from, had no black residents into the 1990's. Any who tried to move in, even as hired help, would be warned it wasn't a good idea to stay too long...it was always understood too well."

"The victim doesn't get paroled from her horrid, undeserved death. This woman was 19 and an adult when she decided to murder."
"From the article:
""There can be a love-hate relationship with that component that I totally understand – for example, models projecting the idea of being super thin and wanting women to disappear in their bodies instead of flourishing and blooming. That is totally linked to a dehumanizing concept of healthy self-esteem or construction of self. There are people out there promoting a bone-thin body, but I think that tendency is being more and more pushed aside and not agreed with because it can be very unhealthy. There are so many movements right now pushing forward a more balanced healthy body, celebrating women and their diversity.""

Yet when she was featured in a spread in the magazine ""Fashion"", she clearly allowed herself to be photoshopped, with a longer neck, narrowed nose , chiselled jaw line and thinner body.

"You should do more that recite what you've heard. I've listened to all the analysis, as I did before the election, as well. I just don't let reporting that be my only analysis. Clinton ran a very good campaign, and much better than the last time. She took on the task that was the most difficult for any woman--being first. I will always stand beside her for that. I wouldn't have been the first, second, third, whatever. The brave ambition was inspiring, and it was wonderful to be a part of. I just hope it isn't too long before the next woman jumps in, of whatever party. Clinton's people knew in advance the long haul that they faced. I realize that they made mistakes, but, as I thought a year ago, Donald Trump would be very attractive to many unhappy folks. He was, and he is. And now we are left with him."

"It was outstanding tracking skills that likely saved this woman's life, although her story is amazing too. To track someone for 26 miles in heavy snowfall, wow! Sounds like another near another death from misapplied GPS. It is a wonderful tool, but over reliance and misunderstandings is killing people by directing them onto unmaintained summer only roads. I suspect in many of these incidents the GPS users had the device set on shortest path, with the device algorithms failing to identify an only seasonal route. The devices accuracy on major roads and highways is typically outstanding, logging, recreational and fire roads very questionable."
"Some obscure nun asks a question of the Pope on a trivial matter, women deacons, and lo and behold we have a commission set up almost straight away.

That's the error you've made, not seeing God's will working, unfolding a million opportunities for people every day to serve, to love, to give. 

Not ""tying"" together, as if a big net, the people of God, such that one useful tug on one side of the net, can yield fruitful results on the other side of the net.

There's a real emptiness - a sadness - in such a narrow view of the world. 

Mother Teresa correctly - generously and trustingly - saw God not just in the poorest of the poor, where she spent most of her life - but also in the richest and ableist.  And she thus made the entire world her difficult apostolate for others to either emulate selflessly or sneer at selfishly, narrow-mindedly."

"“Bodily appearance” by itself is not the issue, nor the notion that “the laity is too stupid to see Christ in a woman.”

The issues involve the theology of the Eucharist described in Hebrews, the iconic value of the elements and minister of the Sacrament, the divine constitution of the Sacrament, the identity of the one Sacrifice with the Mass in an anamnesis.

Attempting to rationalize it is precisely what led - in the West - to a series of destructive Eucharistic heresies."
"I sent this to the 4J board when Walston had the 5 minute infomerical on KEZI a few weeks back: 

Ms. Walston's comments last night on KEZI were nothing short of disturbing. I do not believe anybody (even Republicans) in this community wish to frighten or intimidate young children, but the Law is intended to instill fear (for lack of a better word) in those who would violate it.

You should also consider: a) treatment of single-parent families; b) welcoming of gays; c) valuing of lay views and experiences; d) homilies that address relevance of current Church issues to the gospel; e) invitations to academic experts, lay professionals like docs/lawyers, theologians, Protestants,  and others for evening ""issue"" programs; f) formal surveying of member needs; g) availability of NCReporter; h) racial diversity; i) women on parish council; j) suggestion box availability; k) worship with Protestant churches where other family members attend; l)   recognition of data we already have regarding why people claim they leave: clericalism; legalism; sexism; hubris; anti-sex ism.  Few parishes close because of few opportunities for rosaries and confession and no sermons about confession. I could be wrong.  I join you in defining a) problems; b) solutions.  Learning is what happens AFTER we know it all. Be not afraid of knowledge. Humbly seek to KNOW, not to WIN."

"Although I disagree with you - often! - I do appreciate your honesty.  It is refreshing to hear a ""liberal"" actually admit that he/she does not want a conservative priest in the parish.  Typically, it is hemming and hawing.  

As far as the rest of your comment - again we disagree.  Simply because a woman cannot be a priest certainly does NOT mean she cannot have an important role in the parish.   Most priests I know are servants - and those I know do not look upon women as ""second class"" - in fact, our pastor is always most grateful of the women in our parish....thanks them and seeks out their input.  BTW - he is very traditional."

Your comment seems to lack logic in relation to what I wrote. Miscarriage is totally different than abortion. A woman chooses an abortion. A miscarriage is something a woman cannot control. She is not held accountable to a miscarriage unless she did something that interfered with the viability of the child which resulted in the miscarriage. I am so sorry you lost four children.
"Hi Bob, It would be wrong of me to disagree. Trump certainly stirred up his base and is the worst orator in presidential (or perhaps human history). As I said, no one voted FOR Trump. They voted AGAINST Clinton. Once as a boy on fourth of July, I thought to myself, I AM an American. I was born on American soil. Our identity was defined by us and them (Russians) and the space race. Within a few short years, I realized, it was a lie. Anyone with paperwork was an American and had all the same rights I had. Being naturalized was moot. Our former enemies (Vietnam) were living right next door, cut checks by the US government-given the property they lived on. Many Trump supporters still believe the lie. They believe America belongs to them and not our enemies. Today we are divided against ourselves by sociology. This article represents that division. There is NO war on women. Women are at war with themselves. Abortion is here to stay FOREVER. How does this article make us ""Stronger Together""?"

"First thought into my mind is echoed repeatedly below:  Misdemeanor??  The impact on these girls will last a lifetime.  They are (or were) 16 and 17.

"Mr. Harris, like Ms. Moultry, is specifically referring to Ms Shurtz and branding Ms Shurtz's portrayal of Dr. Tweedy as ""willfully ignorant and malicious.""  Those are both extreme descriptions and both phrases ascribe motivation to Ms. Shurtz.  If I believed Ms Shurtz was either one, I'd gladly seek out that petition demanding her resignation or dismissal and sign it myself.  Nothing in her thirty years as a respected professor suggests she's ""willfully ignorant"" about anything.  Did she show poor judgment with her ""black makeup"" in portraying Dr. Tweedy....Indeed, she did.  Was it ""malicious""mockery (as is ""blackface"")? IMO, no, it was part of a well-intentioned effort to honor Dr. Tweedy and promote others reading his book...an effort which went awry because of her using black make-up and doning an Afro wig in her portrayal.  She has issued a (again, IMO) heartfelt apology.

How about a little understanding, compassion and forgiveness. Then let' work together to make things better.."

"I don't know where she got her ""Canadian values."" What about ""helping others everyday""? We learned in school that the early settlers in Ontario helped each other to get through. Even snobby Susannah Moodie sleighed over in mid-winter with some other women to help a fellow settler  who was said to be ill and out of food.  When she ran out of food, the Natives left food at her door.  I am descended from indigent nineteenth-century  immigrants whose passage to Canada, like that of many, was paid for by the British government ---hand-outs all the way. And like most Canadians, I think immigrants, especially refugees, should be given help to settle. That is our tradition. Leitch lives on another planet."

"It's no question that misinformation, civic ignorance and apathy is abound in our society, and is a pressing issue of our time. Just as there is no denying that populism can sometimes lead to negative outcomes.  But I challenge you to find any evidence that voter suppression and disenfrachisement produces more beneficial policies and representatives for the populations that have their voices suppressed. Less voter turnout will always lead to less policy emphasis on the needs of a particular population. The founders intended the citizenry to vote with their passions, that's why they designed a system of checks and balances and representatives to make decisions on our behalf. But denying blacks the right to vote did not lead to racial equality, and denying women the vote did not lead to gender equality. Society just doesn't work that way."

"And you are doing anything better with this comment?  Ha!  Look, I am not one to fall for Trump's latest propaganda of conciliar speech making, not after all he has said over the past two years.  We need to - and should insist on - ""healing"" in actions as of 1/21/17 from President Trump and his appointed cronies - Giuliani, Christie and Gingrich - to vital positions.  If you hold the expectation that everyone will wake up on Oath of Office day and yearn for unity, you have a very poor handle on human nature.  The divides in the country - particularly expressed openly and with force throughout this campaign - are far deeper, far stronger, and far more publicly stoked by elected officials of the GOP then at any time in our history.  The statements of the Republicans and Trump especially are not easily forgotten, and we have not heard the last of them.  Women wearing hijabs have already been attacked.  Healing is never an easy or simple process.  What can YOU do to start it?"
"I agree with you, Annie. I would like to see the RC Church stop talking about gender, marriage, and sex and instead talk about the qualities of loyalty and love in contexts that everyone can relate to, starting from a very young age. Stop making ridiculous pronouncements about the ""nature of woman,"" stop claiming expertise where you have none, stop pretending that Jesus Christ was a fraction as interested in the pelvic issues as they are."
So you're saying that all the women voting for Trump are choosing party over women? What about those of us who are nonpartisan?
"""She rarely speaks in public and has yet to make clear precisely what she might do with her time in the White House aside from looking after her young son.""
""Aside from""? Many women could probably tell Ms. Givhan that raising children is plenty of work by itself. Suppose that's all Melania Trump wanted to do? Would the public be harmed in any way?
I think past presidents and their wives would probably agree raising children in the White House is a challenging and demanding experience.
And I really loathed those folks who complained about Melania and Barron Trump staying in New York so that Barron Trump could finish out his school year. That sounds mighty sensible to me.
Indications are that Melania Trump wanted nothing to do with Donald Trump's desire to be president. But, what ""the"" Donald wants, ""the"" Donald gets."

"The statistic I would like to see is the following:  the percentage of women appointed during this same period of time for 'open' board positions that were filled during that same period of time.  The additional 3% from 11% to 14% could actually represent more than 50% of new appointments meaning boards are aggressively working on the problem.  Or, conversely, it could be a very negative number if it is only 15% of new or open board appointments.  In the absence of this information we don't know if this is very fast change or slow change."

"The original New York Times article profiled a period in Hillary Clinton's life--just after Bill Clinton lost the governorship of Arkansas--when they were younger and struggling more financially. The article highlights Hillary's initiative in improving the financial well-being of her family and how the birth of her child, Chelsea, was the impetus for her initiative. At that time there was no Clinton foundation and HRC had not formed the political relationships that she now has. 
That you ""detest the nominees of both parties equally"" or ""Clinton a bit more than Trump"" when HRC is a self-made woman whereas Trump is an heir who could and always did beg his daddy for more money when he ran out, which was frequently, demonstrates that you suffer from the same allergy to women exercising power that so many Trump supporters do. You don't measure HRC by the same standards as you do most other politicians who, by and large, follow the same routes to political success as she has."

I cringed, at first read, how callous a generalization: ""dalliance"" thinking on those relationships that may have  been meaningful between priests and women. Then it hit: the article is about those priests who abandoned friend, lover, and child. Who made a conscious decision which weighed their ""affection"", responsibility for their action, their son or daughter and chose abandonment. Whatever the ""feelings"" that enshrouded the relationship during, the stark reality of abandonment renders the crass term ""dalliance"" so appropriate.

What Trump said is terrible. But as terrible as it was it is nothing compared to the real physical harm and destabilizing environment caused and created by Clinton.

"There was one study involving apes and their ""gender"" interest in certain human items.

"I wouldn't be so quick to tout your so-called ""word-smithing"" skills, if your post is to be taken as an example--it reads like you're looking for an excuse to whine about ""reverse-discrimination"" or something.  Don't bother.

Folks of Spanish ancestry are overwhelmingly Catholic and just as saddled with the Inquisition's bloody heritage as Anglo-Saxons--if not more so.  ""Moriscos"" (Muslim Spaniards) were its victims at least as much as Jewish and 'heretical' Christian Spaniards.  One result: 3,000,000 Spanish Muslims were enslaved and sent to Mexico after ""Los Reyos Christianos"" took power in Spain.

Then the Spaniards reached out and touched the Philippines, ""converting"" nearly its entire Muslim population to Catholicism at sword-point.  Only the stalwarts inhabiting the thousand or so southern islands around Mindanao managed to keep their Islam.

No, it's hardly surprising a Catholic with some degree of Spanish heritage might sometimes strike out at Muslims.  Old hatreds die hard."
"I am not stretching the notion of violence at all, skyofblue. Violence and violation come from the same root word, obviously. Whether you know it or not, there is a solid thread in the study of violence that defines it as the violation of the integrity of a person, and it can be verbal as easily as physical. You can probably look it up. Assault, also, can be verbal as well as physical. Look at what is happening on social media, ... cases where people verbally harass someone to the point of suicide.

So, as I said, I don't know whether this woman committed a crime, but there's a very good chance she can end up before a judge in a civil suit. 

We have to take responsibility for what we say. If we hurt someone badly by degrading them, for example, then we have to take responsibility for that, and we can be held to account."
I agree with that Akrider. Same with moose in the city. It's just a matter of time before one of these women pushing their baby in a stroller gets trampled.
"I agree 100% with what you said.  Let me give you some insight from the mental health side.

My wife has her PhD in psychology and had her own private practice for many years. I asked her if she would report someone as mentally defective and she said only if they made a specific threat to take action. It really surprised me so I asked why not. She said it was because that the person being reported could sue and she could lose her license to practice. She was not willing to take the risk to throw her career away without being sure the person was a risk.

This country is too quick to sue and punish people who try to do what they think is the right thing to do. She spent many, many years of hard work to earn her PhD and get licensed. Until they can protect mental health people from retribution than the system is not going to work.

You have the activists that will make accusations of unfit mental health just because they hate guns and think they need to be taken away. Whatda ya do?"
"One reason behind the 66% rate for women initiating divorce - often they can leave and their ""OK"" financially.  The patriarchal court system will see to this.

"A woman just shot a gun in the parking lot of a store at a moving vehicle.  Yep, I think that qualifies for not understanding the risks.

Allowable by law does not mean you won't go to hell for murdering a person, you just may not be prosecuted by the State.  I think whoever wrote that law lacked humanity as well.  I also think you have misread the law after applying a bias that you should be able to kill person to protect your property and did not give a valid interpretation to the last part, ""when another person, other than the perceived offender, is inside of the vehicle.""  The story accuses both people in the vehicle as the offenders, so the law would not provide justification."

""" ... the government website presents abortion as a routine medical procedure ... You should systematically mistrust sites and hotlines that devote a large part of their contents to maternity and the so-called complications and traumas linked to abortion.""

Anything other than this is presumably a ""lie"". 

There are many deaths indirectly caused by abortion. Women with a history of abortion are 3.5 times more likely to die following abortion and 6 times more likely to commit suicide than are women who give birth. They are more prone to substance abuse and other forms of risky behavior. More than 30 studies have linked abortion to higher rates of mental health problems, including depression, substance abuse, suicidal behavior, and anxiety disorders, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder.

I agree completely that it is best to discuss this rationally. So let's do that.  You have a fear of  ""data-basing"", specifically referring to public security cameras, which presumably would be operated by Eugene police. You have referenced ""the government"", presumably federal, keeping a database of public security cameras (which doesn't exist) which would have to be collected from thousands of municipalities all over the country through a program (that doesn't exist) that would require a data storage facility that would dwarf the size of all current facilities. And in this imaginary database there is imaginary facial recognition software (that doesn't exist) that is cataloging your every movement downtown and building a profile on your downtown eating and drinking habits. 

John, we have a very serious (and very real) problem downtown, with harassment and violence towards women. Installing cameras is a very reasonable proposal to help alleviate that. It's not about you John."

"Whether a political leader can be a woman or not is hotly debated among Islamic scholars. Not so among Christian leaders. The trend is for more women leaders in the west, and fewer among muslim majority countries. One of Canada's Prime Ministers was a woman, Kim Campbell. In August 1993, a Gallup Canada poll showed Campbell as having a 51 percent approval rating, which placed her as Canada's most popular prime ministers in 30 years.  In the US, no strong, likable female leader has emerged. When one does, no doubt she will elected. There have been 6 leaders of muslim nations, Megawati of Indonesia, Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan, Khaleda Zia, of Bangladesh, Tansu Çiller of Turkey, Hasina Wajed of Bangladesh and Mame Madior Boye of Senegal, all relatively recent. Much lower percent than in the west. Expect the gap to grow."

Encroaching on their regions comes at a price. Education on wild animal behavior is also good knowledge to have as there are right ways and wrong ways to prevent an attack.
First of all, I have not seen anything reminding people to..MAKE NOISE WHEN YOU'RE IN THE WOODS. ANIMALS HAVE EXCELLENT HEARING AND WILL DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO AVOID YOU AT ALL COSTS.

"Very good point - it seems deeply misguided to make the primary focus on how these murders and suicides affected people after the fact rather than focusing on how they happened in the first place, and therefore identifying what factors and conditions might be changed to reduce the problem in the future. 

I believe it is political, and that that such a 'preventative' focus would identify facts and factors that are politically distasteful and difficult for (speaking frankly) progressive white people to accept. Most of these women ended up dead on reserve lands in deep poverty, and at the hands of their own abusive intimate partners, also Aboriginal. In other words the problem is largely intra-reserve and can't easily be pinned on externalities except the fact that the Federal Government's long-standing policy of incentivizing Aboriginals away from property rights and away from assimilation into modern Canada at large, has only increased Aboriginal poverty and social decline."
"As I recalled the judge stated what he believed most likely took place regarding how the woman's pants were removed. In the circumstances there are only two sensible possibilities: that the woman consented to the removal, or that she was unconscious when it happened. If the former took place, no sexual assault occurred despite the immoral circumstances. If the latter took place then a sexual assault did occur. So it's up to the Crown to prove that the latter is actually what happened, and they couldn't do that. 

Again, take a look at the bigger picture. The issue of consent is there to PROTECT people from sexual assault, and overall it surely has that effect. True, in some cases the issue of consent will be difficult or impossible to judge, but we're still further ahead for having it as a legal requirement. And people do have power in the situation: don't drink to the point of stupefaction. You are less likely to be victimized and more likely to recall it if you are."

"While I do yoga and was a Girl Scout (and leader), my far greater concern is the silence of everyday Catholics on the administration's rhetoric and treatment of immigrants and the poor, especially people of color. Jesus is clear on what is expected of us in the familiar Matthew 25. We have become a country of exclusion, gated communities, and mass incarceration. As Catholics, we know a God of mercy, who came only for sinners, and is the ultimate giver of second chances. Jesus said we would see Him in the poor, the unwanted, the strangers in our midst. Have we become too frightened to meet Him?"
It's sad that NOT doing something stupid is considered News!  Kaaepernick was spurred into making his insane protest by his black Muslim girlfriend - clearly to advance her extreme leftist ideology which puts anarchy above freedom.
Trump is all about racism and antisemitism. He wants to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem...the reason....his daughter married a Jew and converted so Israel is now his second home ....oddly enough now he wants to run it too.
"The ONLY closely contested, partisan race was the VA Governor's race, unless Biden counts the Atlantic City, NJ mayor's race (which no one does);  Biden was a bit of joke as vice president, which is why he didn't run in 2016. He will be nearly 80 yrs old by election day 2020, older than Pres Reagan was when he Left office. He also has a problem in the post-Weinstein era, because of his habit of touching & grabbing women, which has been captured in many photos. In a contested race, you can expect this to be raised by his opponents."
"What a fantastic trip!!!  Congrats, ladies!  Very inspiring."
"“We asked why during this course of time did they not activate the EPIRB. She had stated they never felt like they were truly in distress, like in a 24-hour period they were going to die,” said Coast Guard spokeswoman Petty Officer 2nd Class Tara Molle, . . . ""
.
yet on october 27  appel is quoted as saying, ""When I saw the gray boat on the edge of the horizon, my heart leapt because I knew we were about to be saved,"" she told NBC News. ""Because I honestly believed we were going to die within the next 24 hours.”
.
again, on october 27 the washington post quotes appel, ""It was the most amazing feeling because we honestly did not believe we would survive another 24 hours in the current situation.”
.
""Experts say some of the details of the women’s story do not add up.""

"Maybe you should re-read your post.  Let me do it for you:

""but swimmers do not have the allure of the 'pot of gold' that football players do to focus on achieving athletic success.""  But you say that money does not drive elite performance?  Pot of Gold is not money?...and it does not drive elite performance but it does focus on achieving athletic success.  Huh?

If woman are at their physical peak at 40 and if they have the best opportunity to win an Olympic Gold medal, you are actually arguing that no one would pursue that objective?...simply because college ends.  Give me a break.  Woman are not at their physical peak at 40, especially for an intense sport as swimming. Yes, I am arguing that your logic is flawed.

EVERY private organization wants to earn money / return on their investment and the NFL is no exception.  That is a far cry from being driven by money and as a result being successful."
"We'll shout out, ""This is a gift from God!""

"I was one of the first on the scene today and can confirm this.  I was heading south on NX Expressway and saw a huge plume of dirt and realized a van was off the road.  A truck ahead of me pulled over and I pulled behind him.  I was already calling 911 so he went to assist her and she ran into the middle of the expressway and got on her knees and slammed her hands into the ground and was yelling.  I said this to the dispatch, and then told the driver and responder that  help was on the way.  A few minutes later after helping stop a fire the van seems to have started, I asked the guy about her and he told me that she said ""I was supposed to die!"", or words to that effect.  

I told this to a policeman after everyone else who had stopped to help had left.  I feel really weird that I might get someone in horrible mental shape sent to prison, but that could have been me in the wreck.  Also the woman driver of the Subaru was quite pregnant.  A terrible story from any angle."
"There are numerous historical fallacies and books  about our first Nations people's. An example is celebrated at Thanksgiving shown as a peaceful exchange between the tribes and pilgrims. No one wants to hear about the massacre of women and children which took place not far from Plymouth Rock. No , that wouldnt bode well for school plays and the portrayal of Squanto and the feasting with the new settlers. The reality is people do not want to know facts about politics, cultures and history. Americans operate by media sound bites, drama and emotion. Reason and facts do not impress upon simple minds."
"Why focus on the pain and worry of Muslim mothers alone? What about the mothers of those killed in Brussels, Paris, Nice, London, New York, Istanbul, Koln, Berlin etc. In all those cases, those people were just going about their daily lives and had the rightful expectation they would be safe."
"So the left-wing journalist says, ""the inoffensive motion by Liberal MP Iqra Khalid"".

I guess Ms. Bozo cannot remember that s. 13 from the CRHA was finally repealed when it affected freedom of the Press - Western Standard and McLeans. Now she wants to go down that road again does she? It also restricted freedom of speech and brought punative action against individuals without due process by skipping the criminal courts and sticking into the Administrative Law area where is was pretty well an absolute liability offense.  

It was statements like hers, by the LPC, that brought the affront to freedom of speech in,  in the first place."
"For clarity's sake the woman, not the bears, wore the earbuds."

"What is a racist to you and what's your proof they're disabled and on welfare? You understand only single women with dependent children can get one welfare, right?"
The writer says Muslim woman can choose to cover their hair or their face. Some Muslim woman cover neither. So what makes this so religious? It is very uncomfortable being around people with covered faces. Society should have every right to demand that it stop in public.
We need more women this. We need more women that. That thinking gave us Maryam Monsef.
"Er, no, it isn't. 
Bill Clinton had consensual sex outside of his marriage. I don't think that's great, but it's a really long leap above grabbing a woman's crotch against her permission just because he can."
"Sorry, no. I'm with the Labor Department on this issue.  The same argument was made in the past to justify child labor and lower pay for women.  If you benefit from another person's labor (as this author clearly does), then that person has a right to be compensated for it. Period."
"Nice to see that, as the report notes, both the Conservatives and the Liberals in Ottawa have been working for some time to honour the brave young woman in question who stood up to the barbarity of extremists.

"Hey Jerome...lest we forget the role of Twitter, all's a Twitter...I really hope the word twit returns...but that not withstanding...tweets are rarely news. There is little or nothing newsworthy in tweets, in the little adrenaline rush you get because someone had a brain fart and composes a 140 character post...really, what's the difference between e-mail and tweets? So yes, Jonah has some heartburn because the 'real' conservative is on the stump, of course ""Stump""... I digress...apologists to are just street seeepers that follow the parade....always LOVED Peter at the end of the parade 'cause he got the humor...I digress again. CNN had little d's former campaign manager, before he hired the Russian apologist, on with a woman, Christine something, and he was 'explaining' why little d got to attack the Khans because, 'they were being mean to him' was the gist...but the best part was he is such an a-hole, assault, and to her credit Christine got angry and shut him up! About time!"
"Funny, your description of liberals fits almost exactly how I describe conservatives . (Remember LiAne Richardson, or whatever she now calls herself?) Perhaps sustaineugene is on to something."
"There is diversity among the tribes. Though we are Alaskan Native, our backgrounds are different, dependent on the land/area that we come from. AFN was created so that all of the tribal leaders could come together and work towards political equality. As Alaskan Native, it is imperative that we know Federal Policy (And its changes), to ensure our future generations hold a say in what is done to our land and its people. AFN is proof that we as a people, can work together to see that our way of life is protected. As for your misfortune of having Caucasian parents, I cannot change the way you perceive yourself, or your people. Though I can say, I will not judge you solely based on the color of your skin. If it is your wish to highlight the differences of race and skin color, I would like to disclose that I was raised by an Irish woman, who holds a personality like no other. Here I am, a 4/4 decedent of Qikiktagrukmiut, raised in a, ""White,"" home. I am proof that we are resilient."
And just like that.....Hillary Clinton supporters suddenly care about standards and ethics.
You make such decisions and just assume that your wife agrees? She doesn't get a say in your sexual relationship?
"Oh good Lord.  'providing a new view of yoga “that would not only spark conversation but would actually allow people to live a life of purpose, and potentially deeper meaning.”'

It is an ad campaign for sweat pants.  Eighty dollar sweatpants, mind you.  But sweatpants.

""industry watchers are questioning whether that growth has peaked.""

It has peaked, alright.  No one but the most credulous wants to overpay for a shopping “experience” or meaningless aphorisms like “dance, sing, and floss daily.”  

I think even the most trend conscious of women are waking up to the sheer idiocy of the business model.  See ya, Lulu."
"To the extent that Catholics conform to your model intellectual they're hardly distinctive. And isn't Catholic social doctrine MSW's bailiwick? Obviously not all ideas are equal, and the critic is obligated to ridicule ridiculous ideas. Being ""inclusive"" shouldn't mean uncritical reception of opposing views. MSW rightly disdains Sirico's Crux fluffy piece of anti-socialist apologetics, as if anti-libertarianism is surely the road to socialism, communism and tyranny. What nonsense."
Plus she is a single mom! This women can do it all.
This article is just proving the point that woman talk too much.

"No one needs to do anything to discredit and dishonor Hillary Clinton, she does it all by herself just by waking up every morning."
"AT:  I provided a direct quotation from a study done by a religious organization.  That study showed that 70% of the women in the sample of women who had abortions had ""self-identified"" as Christians.  I don't need to ""clearly imply"" that the majority of women who got abortions claimed they were Christians.  Surely you realize that 70% represents a ""majority"" of that sample group.  You are perfectly welcome to question the study. But, your quarrel is with the organization conducting the study, not with me.  You may, indeed, know women who are ""self-identified"" as Christians and would never have an abortion.  I would never claim otherwise.  Your statement is rather clear:  ""Gary - a ""self-identified"" Christians is meaningless. Just because a person goes to church does not make one a Christian any more than going to a football game makes one an NFL player.""  You're saying that these women aren't ""real"" Christians, regardless of how they ""self-identify"".....you presume to judge them.  GC."

It is intellectually dishonest to pretend that everything has a gray area.  I reject your twisted rationalizations for bigotry.  Homophobia is evil.  Misogyny is evil.
"Yes, Old Soul, I am published.  Hundreds of journal articles.  If someone claimed to have rediscovered some of the science I have published without credit, I would be pissed.  But that is because the science was my work product and attribution important for work reasons.  In the Melania gate matter, Michelle had not made a discovery or formulated ideas that are unique.  She pretty much said boilerplate things that are said all the time and we must remember that Michelle was likely just reading from a script prepared by someone else.  Because the ideas contained in the sentences are pretty much boilerplate, repeating the often stated ideas in the same or other words does not constitute appropriation of Michelle's individual intellectual product.  What is unique about what Michelle said?  Just some platitudes which we have all heard before."
"Arab/Muslime Americans are being treated less than human! We are called Sand N...  

We are being prosecuted in a daily basis! High tech lynching, institutionally racism! Especially for Arab women!!

Our homes are being forcefully stolen and we are being blocked form getting employed!"
You said it. And don't forget: let's hold Americans who sexually assault women accountable for their very gross and indecent behavior.
"To those comfortable with and supporting American white supremacist social, political, economic, ""legal"" and educational precepts, polices and practices--but are unwilling to expose themselves to justifiable outrage by openly saying so--incoherent argument is SOP.  It's not ""fashionable"" to admit, ""I'm white, I'm used to that constituting social advantage, I aim to keep it that way and will resist anyone who attempts to change it.""  Not fashionable, but it would be more honest than the underhanded ""code words"" that express the same ideas."
"That's what you get when you just let anybody in.  But you can't say that because otherwise you are accused of being racist.  But when you get a religion that is misogynist and kills gays, then, you gotta put on your thinking cap and wonder if it is not just one step further until they kill other innocent people, including children.  But you can't say that or you are not multi-cultural."
No woman needed a study to tell them how it really works in Alaska.
I guess we will have to condemn Angela Merkel as an Islamophobic and bigoted racist for stating her opinion that the Islamic face veil for women is incompatible with integration in Germany and should be banned.
"While I don't condone violence, it's very difficult to not empathize with people that are acting out at tRump's campaign stops.  tRump started the media war and now people are inappropriately taking to the streets to answer tRump in kind.  It's too late for tRump to take back his bigoted and racist comments against ethnic minorities and women.  If there's blame it should solely rest on tRump's shoulders."
"I am ashamed to say, I don't see any of the 4 communities I live in are marching. The area is so freaking right-wing, that this march is viewed as all for abortion. I am ashamed and if I could, I would march alone. Unfortunately, I have nothing to make a sign with, so I would look like a crazy woman shouting at the wind and walking in circles! The Sisterhood of the Circling Pants!"

The same ADFG that has a zero success rate in south central Alaska.

ADFG own numbers show a decline in mature shrimp.  Which are all female."
"If this particular mess can be limited to only diocesan priests, they will be somehow neutralized, whether that means they are laicized, or kept on in a ""different capacity.""

I think that there are scandals within scandals here.  At a higher level. This stuff really suggests a deep and disturbing mindset, one that is so much deeper than just some messed up teachings on human sexuality, or some abuse scandals.  There is something really crazy going on here.  For every group like this one, I wonder how many others are out there?  Why is it that Rome seems SO ADAMANTLY against rethinking some of its teachings on human sexuality, on women, on gays?  The pieces of the puzzle just don't fit...

When push comes to shove, so many of the bedrock virtues seem to be evaporating.  Francis cries for mercy, but has effectively changed very little on the abuse scandal...  He talks about compassion, yet Muller can state they won't even answer victim's letters...  What's going on in the church?"
"""DFI would be located in Montreal, with a mandate to work with small and medium-sized enterprises to promote inclusive, green economic growth through the involvement of women and young entrepreneurs in achieving sustainable development objectives.""

"But was it consensual...where are the complaints from women who came forward, it was a private conversation by a private  citizen, nothing sup rises secular  humanists, their all an act to get the spy/enemy combatant elected."
"Even with a warning sign placed near the intersection and advance warning given in several media, enforcement of pedestrian right of way law, or any traffic law for that matter, is like shooting fish in a barrel around here. Why are our motorists so horrid? Is there something in the water or is poor driving just a cultural thing?

Today, I nearly fell down in shock when I saw a motorist fully stop behind the limit line at Charnelton and Broadway for a pedestrian who hadn't even stepped off the curb yet. Of course stepping off that curb puts your body in the path of the many motorists who run stop signs as though they aren't even there.

Of course, moments later things returned to normal as a woman ran the stop sign, then had to stop in the intersection for several pedestrians crossing both ways. The motorist behind her crossed over into the oncoming lane and ran the stop sign at almost 20 mph while shaking his head as though he thought someone had done him wrong."
"Well, Queen Victoria refused to acknowledge that women ""did that sort of thing"". That is why Lesbian activity was never outlawed in the U.K., although homosexual activity was."
"MSW - your Planned Parenthood/Democratic Party lacks nuance.  Your simple statement comes across as single minded and as crass as your prior link to Evangelicals.  You might want to spend some time on this issue - availability of contraceptives; coverage of their costs for low income; etc. is a Women's Issue and a Healthcare issue - duh, it also reduces abortions.  It, imo, is the common good (your stance bends too far to the Fortnight for Freedom wing nuts, Hobby Lobby ridiculousness, etc.
Geez, even the Catholic Church understands that almost no catholic follows HV any more - it makes little sense from many human rights angles."
"Christianity, like almost every other religion / cult of superstition is all about a phoney After Life Insurance Scam.

When doctors were trying to get me psyched up to stick with their anticancer program for me when my haemoglobin was just 43 (1/3 normal) one of them asked ""what about Religion and Spirituality"".  I just laughed at her and she went on to the next item in her check list.

The reality is that the 10s of thousands of no longer believing Christian Clergy often say that learning the futility of prayer was one of the major factors in them realising that it is all a myth.

"This belligerent attitude by China to a peaceful nation doing legal activities, sure reflects well on our trying to get North Korea to come around...not!  North Korea`s wacko leader see`s China bumping ships of peaceful nations, and striking other aircraft in the air with their aircraft.. and we do nothing but protest.  No wonder to N.Korea we seem a ""paper tiger"". they can intimidate us even more under China`s skirt soon, with a nuclear weapons development and delivery program.  We have asked China to rein in north Korea many times...and each time to no avail. 
 If we do not stand for peace defending vigorously against these provocations of nations in the area by China now.... when will we ever? 
What will it take? another pearl harbor type sneak attack at anchor?  That`s too late and too little I`m afraid.  Communism is as bad today as it ever was.. though the Chinese brand has lipstick on it, and a faux stock market, it`s still a repressive regime that brooks no opposition. None."

"This lady had a mediocre product with no intellectual property rights. The competition to her arm warmers is the long sleeve shirt which has been around for many many years. She was lucky to even get an offer in the first place. I'm not sure why she didn't do some soul searching in the first place and decide that she wasn't going to take an offer before signing up for the show in the first place. So what she'd have to give up 40%! I'd rather have 60% of a $1 million company over 100% of a $100,000 company. Her selfish and unintelligent ways robbed someone else of an opportunity."
"Multiculturalism should not mean that we (the west) tolerate another culture's intolerance.  If we do in fact support diversity, woman's rights, and gay rights , then we cannot in good conscience give Islam a free pass on the grounds of multicultural sensitivity.   And we need to say unambiguously to Muslims living in the West: If you want to live in our societies, to share in their material benefits, then you need to accept that our freedoms are not optional. They are the foundation of our way of life; of our civilization – a civilization that learned, slowly and painfully, not to burn heretics, but to honor them."

"Well it seems the author has made claims without clear linking evidence. The fact still remains the conviction rate for rape is quite low. But stating that most rape cases are based on false allegations would require some evidence so I cannot support your comment. And the fact that your a woman does not mean you have authority to make such a sweeping statement either. Peer reviewed research is important. Fanciful opinions based on a few girlfriends is not, at least not for such a huge issue."

"The hateful and sometimes violent homophobia of people that call themselves ""religious"" or ""christian"" is the main reason I became a None! There is no difference in hating someone due to race or religion or sex or sexual orientation. They are all hate and equally disgusting horrific human behavior! And what's worse is when that HATE is spewed out of the mouths of so called religious people. Now, I know not all people who claim religious belief are all homophobic, racists, and women haters. Unfortunately, churches are one of the best places to find such people. And too many large, powerful, well funded institutions are homophobic and bigoted in their actions, if not their words. Hate and tribalism under the disguise of ""religion"" is worse than just plain old hate for the sake of hate. At least such people aren't looking to use religion as an excuse and justification for their bigotry, whatever the flavor!"

What a revolting offensive statement. Without accreditation from a well-paid crowd at CBC, this Cdn woman would be speaking to issues in a non-generalizing non-insulting Cdn manner

A Cdn National Ideal has always been to intellectually look with reason & logic to understand a problem rather than igniting with the zealous hate speech of a devotee of a religiosity

Cdns are being maligned here; subcutaneously accused by 'flippant name-calling' which does not fairly apply in this underhanded insult from a zealot. Its obvious it should be called out for what it is.

Seems a purveyor of 'religious bigotry' wrote the article.

This Cdn women has 'led' with her foggy 'bigots' as 'dealers in pain & death'; she should stop & take a good look at the type of psychopathic Islamic Jihadism whose adherents 'live to revel in Death', as per THEIR interpretation of her Islam.."

"The Saudi Princes have been working on two types of acquisitions-- not condos. First, they are buying billions in state of the art military equipment and arms from the US in deals cut by Trump and Jared Kushner with the objective of the Saudis joining us in holding Iran back. Second, the Arabs are working with Goldman Sachs, supported by Trump and Gary Cohn (ex Goldman CEO and now Trump Economic Advisor)-- to put together public/private joint ventures under which the Saudi's would buy up infrastructure projects and sites, provide capital and leverage that capital with the borrowing/bond issuing power of states and cities. This would use Saudi private investors to capitalize projects without increasing the Federal deficit and leave funding with the Saudi joint ventures and states and municipalities."

I know conservatives don't like fact checkers (is it because they won't use fox, breitbart or wnd for their fact checking?) but here it is anyway.

I think there are Native Americans that would have a few things to say about this. She is a purveyor of hate and fear. Somehow that equates to intellectualism to conservatives. By all means, go see her. You won't learn any truths but that's not why you like her anyway."

"Of course I don't think things were perfect prior to the '60's. We are all faulty human beings, then and now. But now, we seem to have lost whatever semblance of sanity we had left. We do NOT have a healthy view of sex or our sexuality today. And our use and the readily availability of contraception is another cause of this problem, a major one. What is naive is our view of sex today, that we can have sex without regard for the natural consequences, that we can turn off our natural biological reproductive functions without consequence. False. The Pill has caused all sorts of clot issues in women, not to mention the IUD. ABC is also a major factor in adulteries and divorce as well as more abortions than prior to contraception and the legalization of it. 
You really think that our understanding of our sexuality is better than in the past? That's naive. Our views are not based on reality any more, but on fantasy. Following the ""world"" is not wisdom."
"I called the policy short-sighted. Read your reply again. Casting aspersions is unnecessary and adds nothing to the debate. 

You and I must know very different women and minorities. The folks I live, work and socialize with find the policy you advocate totally unnecessary and demeaning. They're more than capable of competing and succeeding on their own, and they don't want their achievements sullied by those who aren't. They don't need an external enemy to absolve them from taking responsibility for the disappointments in their lives."
Why should the tax payers fund planned parenthood and pay for abortions it's time women got equal treatment by being allowed to take care of there needs on their own.                                                    Why can't the baby daddy help pay the cost of abortions why are working Americans responsible for their bad choices. It's your choice to have an abortion it should be my choice not to pay for it.                                                            Typical left brain thinking gimmie gimme gimme.

"""As a quasi state agency OHA has a political agenda (some trustees) based upon federal recognition and supporting high priced law firms in Washington DC. ""

This statement does not logically flow.  If they were more interested in helping the state than the Hawaiian people then federal recognition does not seem like it would benefit the State in any measurable way -- just Hawaiians.  OHA could conceivably be controlled by non-Hawaiians at some point due to Rice v. Cayetano.  Federal recognition is one way of making sure that Native Hawaiians always retain some degree of self-determination.

""The State of Hawaii would love federal recognition because it would absolve them of fulfilling their kuleana to our people: Education, DHHL, Health and DLNR, which since statehood have given minimal attention to our people.""

So would you prefer that Hawaiians be wards of the State of Hawaii in perpetuity or would you like Hawaiians to start taking responsibility for our own affairs?"
Coulter is getting everything she dreamed of - attention.  In the age of Trump she had become irrelevant and forgotten. A has-been.  Berkeley should have let her talk.  The students should have ignored her - let her talk to an empty auditorium.  Deprive her of the attention she's seeking.  Reward her with yawns.  Instead they played right into her hands.  Idiots.

"It is tough, but even Ted Bundy's mom loved him to the almost very end, sticking up for his innocence and finally realizing that he indeed was the serial killer of so many young women. It is natural to have blinders on when you have adult children and I think one reason that by some miracle you son or daughter will straighten out, parents have eternal hope, the way we are wired. Perhaps they thought his girlfriend would inspire him to be a good member of society, of course it probably would not have. Maybe his parents were terrified of him. Who knows, but I am sure for one thing, his parents are just as sad at the way things turned out. My question is why did not she not leave him, was she terrified to? I think that thankfully most of us have not had a sociopath in our family circle who is not only crazy but meaner than a junk your dog, and that can strike terror in anyone's heart because they often kill their own family members."

"Yes, yes, yes.  I get it.

Women can sign contracts, take out mortgages, become legal guardians of the infirm, sign wills, create corporations, buy vehicles, parent children, join and create associations, buy their own clothing, buy their own disposable goods, make life and death decisions as health care practitioners, educate our children, abide by ethical policies, run for office, etc. and exercise, daily, astronomical varieties of personal decisions and personal responsibility but ...

when it comes time to choose their major at university or start a career, they are agency free automatons with zero free will.  They simply cannot stand up to the power of society.

Thank goodness the suffragettes didn't suffer from this modern weakness of spirit."
"I am quite sure Anglicans in Third World countries -- primarily, Africans (where numerically most Anglicans in the world live) -- will eventually come around and ordain women -- simply because they are fundamentalist in regard to Scripture, highly Protestant (like US African American churches/members who ordain  women and have very little regard for Tradition). First world Anglicans/Episcopalians, however, are a dying group. They are less than 1% of the US, demographically invisible and hardly gentry as their small parishes absorb more diverse and poorer segments of the population. Even in England, only 19% of the population identifies as Anglican. It has become just another religious subculture. When the titular head of the English Anglian Church (the Church of England) passes on, it will collapse even more. The future of Anglicanism is in Africa, where it will be highly Protestant, irrespective of Catholic costume, liturgical clothing, etc."

"You just made this up.  The government must only allow speech.  It does not have any obligation to make sure speakers are heard.

"Harper thinks Canada is strong proud and free. Trudeau celebrates the indegenous and feminists.

"No one owes Trump an apology. Trump owes the citizens of the United States an apology for stirring up discord, and bringing overt corruption into the office of the president.

I agree with you that in this case, Trump wasn't being sexist so much as egotistical. Trump even told an interviewer that he ""wanted to put his own mark on the Fed. He chose a chairman who approved of the very cautious and prudent policies of Janet Yellen, not, in my opinion, so much based on gender. However, President Obama put far more women in powerful positions than Trump has, so far."
"Ms./Mr. Lemmons have you ever found yourself in a situation where you have been badly misled by a person for years if not decades and formed a negative opinion of that person due to the information available to you? Then you meet the person and find that she/he is really quite a decent, intelligent, compassionate and dedicated human being? Hillary Clinton is probably the most qualified individual in the past century to be POTUS. She finished two terms as a New York Senator with a 67% approval rating. She finished her term as Secretary of State as the most admired woman in the world. There has been a determined campaign for over thirty years from the right to vilify and label Clinton because they knew she was powerful enough to one day run for POTUS. They have painted a very negative picture that you seem to have fallen for. And that the Sanders campaign capitalized on. Do some research and you'll see that she hasn't even had a traffic ticket conviction."

How is receiving Communion in a state of grace an ideal? You do know that does happen for people on occasion, right?

I mean, it seems that you would be getting at the notion that ""Curia policy"" (no contraception and no ordination are examples which I imagine you would bring up) hurts women in some way. Let's leave aside the argument for now about whether or not God Himself would support such ""policies"", does a woman live in fear of the Curia's reprisals against them if they ignore such policies?

Going back to the beginning, do you think union with Christ is simply an abstract ideal? Have you read John 15 about the absolute requirement from Jesus to ""remain in me""? Was that just a flowery ideal from our Lord?"
Actually their deeper objection is to women having any sexual rights or independence AND not wanting to be perpetually pregnant. Babies are a punishment for sexual autonomy.

Scowling ""gangsta"" athletes, with their entourages, vapor trails of abandoned kids and wives, and quickly diminishing bank accounts in their post playing days.

Yes, that may well be the future of hockey. No more ""aw shucks"" humility, fake or not.

"Mr. Olsen, according to the Pew Research Center and corroborated by too many sources to mention in this post, of ALL women who voted on November 8th, 54% voted for Mrs. Clinton, 42% voted for Mr. Trump, and 4% voted for other candidates.  Of that 42%, non-majority female vote, the breakdown is as follows:  White women 43% Clinton/53% Trump/4% Other;  Black women 94% Clinton/4% Trump/2% Other;  Latino women 68% Clinton/26% Trump/6% Other;  Women not identifying as White, Black or Latino 61% Clinton/32% Trump/7% Other.

I am taking this position because, especially over the past few days, it seems to me that our ""discussions"" become more of an argument, which is something I don't want to engage. Another reason is that I think it is clear we will not agree, so I don't see the value of continuing. Finally, regardless as to what you or I think, I believe these very personal decisions remain with the women carrying the fetus/child, not with me, you or the govt; that a pro-life position can be one that does not involve the govt. making these very personal decisions. As I have said before, I understand you see it differently.

So, I invite you to join me and accept that we will not agree and prayerfully wish each other well and move on.

God bless,

"Human beings tend to be pretty intelligent critters. With this in mind, it is easy to see why this woman would not only come to realize the dangers associated with alcohol consumption, but to have the sense to back out and speak up.

20,000,000 consumers of alcohol die from this each year world wide. 20 million! The 2 most dangerous substances sold for human consumption are available over the counter in America: alcohol and tobacco. A third group of toxic substances sold for human consumption, fatty, processed foods, are totally unregulated, even by age.

The numbers mean that lots of folks are going to die no matter what policy we pursue. The good news is that we can make a difference in the numbers of life ending or altering events because we have new policies being developed and tested that are showing results after a long number of years. Harm reduction policy such as enacted by Portugal at the turn of the last century is showing promising results. 

Merry Christmas: Happy Holidays"
"I'm sorry but the way I see this, it doesn't matter how long ago Mr Trump said those awful, gross and inappropriate comments to women. We need to stop making excuses for his bad behavior. Happy to not alright for him to say those things and regard them as ""that's the way he is"". He can is running yo he our next president,  it's scary TI think he will say inappropriate things to minors, women and other races just to prove his point. Because that's Donald Trump's way!

"I see I've already had a comment deleted.  If I quote Trump exactly, I'll have another one removed.  He spoke of groping a woman's genital area and getting away with it because he's a ""star.""  That's sexual assault, and I am confident a felony in every state in the union.  I have no standing to report the crime, but the victims and witnesses could have and should have; maybe they still can and will.  Trump has used money and power to avoid the consequences of his behavior -- he's a ""star.""  Your attempts to minimize this filthy, vulgar, despicable behavior and to defend the creep who engaged in it are nearly as offensive as he is.  Until today I was worried that he might become President of the United States.  This is the first day since he announced his candidacy that I have felt confident that he won't."
"Maybe the guy in the line-up was upset with the cashier wasting his time, rather than the woman returning the milk? 
I mean who cares why she was returning it, it's a few bucks and it's refundable, just give her the cash back. Probably exactly why the other employee said ""just do it"". 

Obviously I wasn't there, but that scenario immediately came to my mind while reading your story. Why hold up an entire line of people just to find out the reason someone returns a few litres of milk, makes zero sense. 

I hate to say it, but you may have been ""making assumptions"" about him.  Maybe he had a bad day, was in a hurry, and was impatient with the cashier, rather than racist? 

Saying that, I get where you're going with the rest of the article, and agree."

"Addendum:
The Pope did not reference Isiah and "" the suffering servant"" which many scriptural folks can connect to Christ. In time sense ing gerunds are ongoing present tense.
He also referenced Luke. Time was there was a thought that not only was Luke a physician- Taylor Caldwell had a great novel about him- but he was long lived and a friend to Mary. In fact, I was taught Mary was his primary source for his gospel. Even if not grounded in fact- stories like this play an important role.
Think of Mary's role at the wedding in Cana.
My guess is Mary would have been one of the women who the Depression era hobos would have marked.

"Well we can't read Gods mind or speak our own words in place of his.  There is  the KJV Bible Iy talks about these things are going to continue to happen unless we ""repent"" not admit, but repent & change our ways.  But the world continues to go in a downward spiral, because people don't feel the need to change, its everyone else.  It is written in       2 Timothy 3: 2-5  I was looking at a picture of what I consider a wonderful dance group.  What was the problem?   Out of about 10 people, 6 were all taking ""selfies"".  They weren't that great, it goes a little overboard!  But since you mentioned God yourself, I didn't originally bring him up, I thought I'd remind people who claim to believe in the lord God almighty to read your Bibles. Only after reading many times over is the light of whats happening in this world, its all written even in the bible.  Even comparing women with nose rings who thing it makes them beautiful, only compares them with pigs.  As it is written.  Proverbs 11:22."

Just as well, of course, since she would have to sell flowers to anyone who can pay for them  --  not just people she approves of  --  if she did stay in business.  

And it's pride that was her downfall.  There are so many kind ways to turn away a job one doesn't want  --   overbooking, illness, vacation  --  if one doesn't feel the need to rub someone's nose in one's judgmental disapproval.  

It's funny,  my Bible is chock-full of teachings about loving kindness, not judging, and not making a big, proud display of one's piety  --  especially the Gospels.  Not Mrs Stutzman's, apparently."

"An example was a woman, part of the group trying to disrupt the event, who before the rally posted on facebook that she was going to get ""100 scalps"". Then during the rally an interviewer asked this woman about an old woman being hit with an explosive and she just shrugged it off. But when she started attacking, while wearing a bandanna to obscure her face, and she herself got hit, why then she was a victim of violence .

This sort of thing shouldn't need to be formalized, but sadly it does.

"Agree with you ""justmaybe""

If Trump, the Republicans, and the Catholic hierarchy would be pushing to overturn Row v. Wade, America would probably experience something that occurred in Poland.  The women, by the thousands, did not go to work or classes, but protested out in the streets.  Polish women just came out with raised umbrellas and some clothes-hangers, [a symbol of back-street abortions in Poland].  It was enough for the Law and Justice Party in Poland to tone down their positions---and drop the measure."
"Yes, it is, because it lowers costs overall. By the way, your claim about Pelosi is based on a blatant lie by Republicans about what she actually said, to whom she said it, and what she was referring to. I think you probably already know this, but she was telling a convention of county officials from all over the country that THEY would have to wait to see the final bill and what would be in it because it was still being negotiated -- in public meetings with bipartisan participation -- in the Congress. This is of course normal with every piece of legislation.

She was not speaking then to lawmakers and telling them that THEY had to vote on it first before finding out what was in it. That was the GOP's Big Lie campaign that fooled a lot of uninformed voters."

"The left wing media, academe, inteligenciea, Liberal Party, socialist hordes and feminists of Canada all demand action to get more women into positions of power in government and politics.

Yet there is no reason to think the first female president of t US won't be a woman who is a fiscal conservative like Le Pen, May, and Thatcher. The call for more women in positions of power in Canada is very narrowly defined and exclusionary of many talented women."

"The initial disclosure by Rapp was public. It was disclosed via a Buzzfeed interview. Spacey chose to respond the same way Rapp did: Publicly.

That is actually logical, reasonable, and makes common sense.

And if you are referring to Cam Newton's ""public"" apology to the female reporter when Cam commented ""It is funny to hear a question about 'routes' from a female""......you are mistaken or confused about that also.
-
The initial question was very public. Cam's initial response was very public. The NFL's response was very public. So Cam's apology had to be very public as well.
-
Note: I always have taken issue with the ""Blatantly Sexist NFL"" (that has plenty of good-looking female cheerleaders but nary one single female head coach or coordinator) throwing Cam ""under the bus"" the way the NFL did.

"Is the site making up stuff, or it factually accurate?

This site foments anti-trad animus, according to many trads anyway.  But I don't call NCR a ""hate site.""

This is what I mean about polemics.   

What if the essay had been written by a Trad, about abortion being against American and Christian values?

Wouldn't you at least agree there is room for argument on both sides of that issue?

I would, even though I largely fit into the pro choice category, I understand there is a valid argument from other other side.

I wouldn't label those who disagree with me as Un christian, or un American.

The author of this essay was so bold as to do just that on the imm. issue, which is why I say the essay  is a  polemic.

I think the author went too far.

It's not a big deal."

"Brother William,
In doing my research for this very text - Romans 16:7, I found some very interesting  information that I believe will be of interest to you, also.
As we both know, Greek is the original language the New Testament was written in. So, I looked at the original language for this specific verse. Here's a breakdown of some key points:

Junia in the original Greek is  Ἰουνιᾶς, ᾶ, ὁ.  Noun, Feminine; Phonetic Spelling: (ee-oo-nee'-as); Definition: Junia, Junias, a Roman Christian. -Strong's Greek Lexicon-
Therefore, your statement ""...but more likely its a sobriquet (nickname) for the very common name Junious"" is incorrect. Junia was indeed a female, according to this.

 ""Kinsman"" that Paul wrote to speak of her in the original Greek is συγγενής, ές.  Adjective; Phonetic Spelling: (soong-ghen-ace'); Definition: akin, relative. -Strong's Greek Lexicon-

Your point that women received ministerial licences but were never ordained as elders/never served doesn't make sense to me?"
"I totally agree. However should Catholic bishops, because they are against abortion and contraception, favor the Rebublican candidate because of this one issue. The Republican Party is Pro-Life, but work very hard to cut back on programs that help poor people. In my mind, Trump would not have been elected without the Catholic vote and the evangelical Christian vote. I believe in a more progressive tax system. The top 1% make much, much, more than the average worker. I'm pretty sure that a lot of Republicans vote Pro-life but are supporting programs that hurt the poor. I think it's a grave sin that in a country as rich as ours, children are going hungry. I think that abortion should be legal. I also believe that contraception should be readily available so that abortions are not necessary. During the time of St. Augustine, the baby wasn't considered a person until ensoulment (when the mother could feel life. I think that late term apportions should be for very serious reasons."
"This woman exercised her free speech, and I would think giving the finger on a live broadcast would have been the LEAST thing to worry about. Why aren't Democrats getting pissed at how this all played out? Even AFTER the emails were leaked, having Schultz ""resign"" and then make her a chairwoman in her campaign should feel like a slap in the face to all the voters! Seriously people, what in the honest to goodness fuck are you guys getting pissed off about? Your anger and resentment is pointed at the wrong person and the wrong actions. Chelsea Lyons Kent was just fed up with all the bullshit and happened to be in front of the camera at that time and she took it and ran with it. Big ups to her for exercising her free speech and doing what she felt she needed to do. If I was there, It'd probably be much worse than just a middle finger. And for all you Dems who support HRC, good on you, that's your choice, but in all honesty how the hell do you guys sleep at night?"
"What Shannyn is really saying is that she's devastated by Hillary Clinton's loss. She's not telling the truth when she say's she thought Hillary would lose. She , and all liberals across America thought she couldn't lose---especially against Trump. Hillary ,like Shannyn , tried to claim there was war against women to gin up votes .They boasted about how now was the time to elect a woman and break the glass ceiling .The problem was--they nominated the wrong woman. Every reasonable person knows she broke the law and lied about the emails--and that Obama's justice department derailed justice.  Most know her and Bill used pay for play to enrich the Clinton Foundation which meant themselves.The majority of American's thought she was dishonest and untrustworthy ,which she was.  Many thought she was heartless the way she told miners to find new jobs and how the four who died--"" what does it matter now ? "" .There's no war on women . Ask Planned Parenthood. They have 1300 to cases to prove it ."
"It's encouraging to hear the popularity of this kind of topic among younger folks. I doubt many have problems believing in God or even Christ's message to us all, the problem is the discord between the institutional message versus science. For example, overpopulation is destroying our environment and straining the planet's resources but effective birth control is wrong. Treatment of gender dysphoria is wrong. Only heterosexuals are entitled to have a healthy relationship. While justice is part of the Beatitudes, women are not entitled to full participation in the church. 

Now, is that rational?"
I understand a cheerleader being required to be able to do the splits to make the squad.   I understand training to be able to do that during the camp.   However that poor girl is screaming in pain and begging to stop.   To continue to force it at that point (risking severe injury) IS cruel and abusive in my book.
"Because in this particular case, the foreign leader he is admiring is also well-known to have misogynist and racist views. Presumably, the judge also has negative views of women and visible minorities. At least, you'd assume that since he is openly proclaiming admiration for Trump he agrees with Trump's statements and actions."
"Thank you, ma'am.  Nice to see your voice, too.

As for Ms.Amylou, she pretty much lets her religious bigotry off its chain whenever she's talking to me.  And then flees when I prove her wrong from her own scripture.  I therefore have a different opinion of her."
The alternative being promoted in the Philadelphia example is to give influence and power over to activists. How objective do you think these women will be? Why are we giving such power and influence to activists?
"Nathan,

I think you believe the preponderance of NT 'evidence' shows the early church at that time did not select women as deacons, elders, overseerers or apostles.  I also think you take Paul's reasoning for not appointing women at face value.  In other words you distort neither the text nor its meaning to arrive at your conclusion.  Christian liberty and grace alone are sufficient to allow for a change in practice to accommodate the current cultural need.  You depend on biblical evidence to arrive at that conclusion.  Its to the facts you say, 'so what?'  You don't say 'so what?' to the law.  You argue the law (or spirit of the law) permits us, here at this time and place to ordain women as elders.  

That is not how Adventists arrive at doctrine, but it is a legitimate hermenuetical way to arrive at Christian doctrine.  

I know you don't say, 'so what?' to the bible."
"I think many were very surprised that the woman who embezzled $200,000 received no jail time; it just doesn't make any sense to me."
"Perhaps, Tri, the upshot of a failure to work in the implementation of Vat II is ""schism, strife, dissent, factions, polemics, ...""  

In other words, maybe all this was going to occur with or without implementing Vat II.  Being female, I really do want to see a lot of change in how the church considers issues that affect families and women.  Women work now, have careers now, get advanced degrees now, participate in decision making, have growing influence in politics.  And yet, the Church sidelines women.  I think we have also learned a great deal more about humans, creation, evolution - and we need to deal with non-heterosexuals as equally beautiful creations of God 

What I do believe is the process of change is messy and we are in the process of change.  If the church does not change it will fade into a cult like sect, not the tool of evangelization that is their charge from God Himself.  Whatever you may think about how things have changed, they have changed.  The past is gone."
"Why liberals want to re-open the abortion and same sex marriage debate in Canada is beyond me.  It's 2017.  Enough with the fear mongering and deceptions already.

Most faiths have social conservatism entrenched in their dogma and Justin is on record as being a devout Catholic who is also personally opposed to abortion.

Islam and Catholicism mirror each other in their views on abortion and same sex marriage.   

Can you EVER recall a liberal bashing a Muslim for their views?  No?  Why?  You will be labelled a bigot.  

Can you EVER recall a liberal bashing a Catholic for their views? Yes?  Daily?  Why? You are now a progressive.

The irony is, liberals have a strong Catholic base in Quebec, so liberals are in fact self-loathing in their ideology.  Canada can't afford ideological leaders like Justin (all MP's must vote pro-abortion) and the identity politics emerging from this regime."
"In a recent political speech, Hillary Clinton spoke about the Syrian situation in which she said she was going to enforce a no fly zone in Syria. But first, she would have a discussion with the Russians, who have already made it clear that they would shoot if the U.S. did that. So, Clinton would be risking a war with the Russians if elected President and enforced a U.S. no fly zone in Syria. What would Mr. Dion think about that? Enforcing sanctions, and going along with the U.S. on their Syrian policy. As for the Crimea, Russia took massive casualties there during WWII, but as Kruschev was a Ukranian, he gave the Ukraine status as an independent state, which resulted in the Black Sea fleet being based outside of the Russian federation, and to say the least, this was simply not acceptable to the Russians, and that is completely understandable for those with any appreciation of history. That would exclude Mr. Dion, who is incapable of rational thought."
"Gary. Why must you and others on the left constantly accuse others of doing just what you do? My question still stands, did you support BC? Do you think HRC in her vicious attacks on BC accusers show any real caring about victims of sexual misconduct? Why would you support a person who, in her own words to wall st. say she will tell the people what they want to hear but she is really for the corruption known as Wall ST.? I will give you this Gary, both you and Eric have developed a fine art of deflection, Eric never answered  my original question about HRC backing WS against Main ST., instead, and it was really quite humerus to read, went off on a tangent about HRC use of the word bimbos when referring to those unfortunate woman victimized by BC was what they deserved to be called. I dislike Trump, and I see a lot of folks who dislike him personally still willing to vote for him. I guess it is hard for the narrow minded to understand some of us are fed up with being used. Not all."
"Yeah dude, it's different. If you can't grasp that you need to start over with your elementary education. Consensual sex is not assault. Women have the right to enjoy sex if they want. They don't have to be a madonna or a whore just because they are ""someone's daughter."" And you know, pretty much anyone would go after someone who had sex with their spouse. Hillary's a normal woman, whoa, crazy revelation."
"Rape is a real crime and should be only be investigated by real police and prosecuted with real prosecutors and real judges. Why do feminists want to dumb it down to plagiarism?

"Yes, she is a broken down old foreign money bag lady who has severe mental and physical problems that has no chance  of being president.  Trump will eat here alive in the debates if she gets that far as America is fed up with the Dragon lady."
"Thank you for having the courage to share such as personal and horrific story. I felt nauseated the whole time I read your well written account.  It allowed me to gain insight into the difficulty for a child, then young woman, to come to grips with her abuse especially when there were no adults she could trust to tell and the abuser kept her in a co-dependent relationship.   It helps explain why those who have been abused don't tell their story."

"The Guardian recently published an article on women only parks in Iran: www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/aug/09/women-only-parks-tehran-iran-segregated-outside-spaces.

And if so, is that regardless of how they identify sexually?"
"I would gladly trade affirmative action for equality. We have never had that option. White women are the primary beneficiaries anyway. It was white folks that came up with that compromise. White Republicans became the racists when they invited the Dixiecrats into the GOP. It took 50 years but they have managed to get the Klan and Nazis into the GOP today. Not all Republicans are racists. However, they are all collaborators with white racists. BTW, Democrats are just the lesser of 2 evils. They tend to be feckless. White people control most state legislatures, Congress, the Supreme Court, and all but 8 years of 200 years of the presidency. They all have more power than cities and mayors."

That doesn't mean yours is the only right one. Based on the numbers and the odds, yours probably is right on some things and not on others. It is all interpretation."

"What's true is your projecting your bias onto other people.

I'm a liberal and I don't care about political correctness as I do much as I do the truth, (which has evidence).   Issues of morality or ethics are personal, I don't expect others to have exactly the same beliefs, nor do I demand it.    

Liberal is also the base word for the word 'libertarian' Don.  Liberals also should stand for the right of the individual to make their own choice for happiness.   IMO

Political correctness?  How about demanding all people have to stand for the national anthem or they don't love their country.   How about a gay person must hide being gay in public and accept less than equal civil rights?
How about woman must know her place,(house), or accepting being groped by the boss?

"Germany, following many European countries and regional jurisdictions within Europe, is to ban the Islamic full-face veil for females, i.e. the burka and the niqab.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel said in a speech to her CDU party's annual conference yesterday, that the burka and niqab are ""incompatible with integration in German society,"" and she said: “With us, the rule is: show your face, that’s why the full veil is not appropriate.” Ms Merkel received an 11-minute standing ovation following her speech.

This is good news because no one can say Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel is a racist or a bigot. Ms Merkel's position re the burka is proof you can be compassionate, pro-diversity, pro-immigration, etc, while you can accept the logic and sense of banning the burka in European countries."

Another alternative might be to pay them more fairly and treat them more decently.  Living in the shadows?  Yes indeed, and the Trump approach is now driving more and more undocumented immigrants deeper into the shadows.... Is that a good thing?  Are you suggesting these folks would be ""better off"" to be deported?  Forget the ""status quo"" stuff.  How about working to make the lives of undocumented immigrants better.  BTW: I've rented to Latino families and they've been the nicest, friendliest, most respectful tenants I've ever had.  And, BTW, our rentals are not ""substandard"" ..

"As part of a trend to promote feminism in Canada, governments generally are light on women who murder. Sad for the victims' families but they are never listened to.

I""m personally thankful for the jobs that Trump was able to keep in Indy. Unlike the selfish low info people being interviewed I realize that every job kept benefits my community."

What we think does not matter until we can prove it."

"Catholic hospitals are not allowed to intervene when a pregnant women is dying due to complications?  This is nothing more than a euphemism for ""Catholic hospitals are not permitted to perform an abortion to save the life of the mother.""

"I think requesting from Rome the ordination of women deacons perpetuates the non-biblical notion that all ministries flow from a central authority and can be extended or impeded at the will of that authority. The authenticating source of biblical ministries is pneumatological (deriving from the Spirit), and not institutional or hierarchical. Even the classic texts in Acts that portray the apostles as laying on hands assume that they do so under the inspiration of the Spirit."
"No personal beef. I’ve encountered Teressa Raiford at many public meetings (most recently the COAB and CRC) and have always politely listened to her.

When she showed up at the school board to protest (justifiably, I believe) then-Superintendent Carole Smith, her group brought nooses. Imagine the outcry had white activists brought nooses to protest a black superintendent. It was a racist gesture on the part of Raiford’s group. Whatever the cause, she will find a way to introduce racism.

Raiford has found a home in Portland. This city’s white progressives will not tell her to her face what they really think. She's got them whipped."

"4/5 
As Catholics, concerning abortion, we are required to hold two conflicting things in our minds. On the one hand, life is the womb is immortal, and thus fully human, and thus not to be snuffed out. On the other, we are required to respect the freedom of conscience of those who hold that we are not immortality, that life in the womb, up to some point, is merely potentially human, but not yet fully human. That's what Jesus sees.

How resolve this conflict? 

First, it would be utterly immoral for us to attempt to impose our convictions about immortality and thus about life in the womb on others, and therefore, in a pluralistic society, we may NOT attempt to make our conviction the law of the land. To push for a law outlawing abortion is no different that condoning the inquisition, which in our past, imposed religious views on others.

Second, we must do everything we can to diminish the frequency of abortion, short of imposing our views on others at the point of the sword of the law."

"Why would anyone think it was safe or prudent to go into a known terrorist controlled zone with his pregnant wife? What type of overbearing egotism does that take? And what type of woman allows herself to be lured into a situation like that knowing she is pregnant? I'm sorry they were captives, I'm sorry the husband is so bitter, but their experience proves out the warnings the US and others have issued about the region. If you ignore warnings, bad outcomes occur. This is just one example."
"Why is the left so enamored of Islam and islamo-fascism?.  After all, Islam unambiguously rejects most of what liberals like Timothy Ash CLAIM to defend: (freedom of religion, womens rights, gay rights, etc)
History can be most illuminating.  It is an undeniable historical fact that progressives lionized and looked  kindly on fascist movements in Germany and Italy in  the 1930's and in fact had no problem when Joseph Stalin made his famous alliance with Hitler in 1939 (Molotov-Ribbentropp pact). Why were progressives attracted to fascism? Because they both had the same enemy - capitalism and Western democracy.

Today we see the same: progressives defending ""one of the most retrograde forces in history"" - to quote Churchill - because they see immigration of muslims into the heart of Europe as a useful stalking horse in their interminable battle with capitalism. 

That's why we have twits like Timothy Ash asking: Can the center hold?"

"Much truth in the headline to this article. During my entire oil patch career I never held a job with pension benefits. I was petrified of poverty in retirement so I saved diligently and invested aggressively. The payoff being huge pots of money in my retirement since I didn't marry and have a family.

I mostly retired 8 years ago and I am enjoying my retirement immensely. Community volunteer activities take up a fair amount of my time. I have even joined the board of the women's emergency shelter nearest to my farm. quite a stretch for a former tradesman. Winter sports (X-country skiing and snowshoeing), summer gardening, old auto restoration, reading, cooking, investing, and occasional travel fill my days, auto restoration and the travel being my only expensive hobbies.

Living in a rural area, growing much of my own food, is amazingly economical. If I dropped the old cars and the travel I could live comfortably on $20K/yr."
"I think individuals care more than our governments do.  When I think of the conditions inside that country--the starvation due to mismanagement and corruption, the state sponsored--or required--of family members spying on each other and reporting the smallest infractions that often lead to death sentences, horrible work camps, it makes me ill.. A satellite map of the world shows a black hole at night where North Korea should be.  And that fat psychotic killer with the bad hair killing his own relatives in the most horrendous ways is absolutely sickening.  The North Korean people will never be able to mount a revolution due to being absolutely repressed and brainwashed. Heard an inteview with an escapee who had been forced to kill his own mother.  They have no idea what the outside world is even like.   Christopher Hitchens prior to his trip to NK said he refused to use the term ""Orwellian.""

"I do not agree. Many gospels were rejected because they were written far later than the earliest ones.  Regardless of the title of the book, who knows what else was in it that may have caused the Pope to reject it? Again, did he infallibly state that the Blessed Mother was NOT assumed into heaven? The Church does not work by innuendos when declaring something dogma or anethema. 

Of course my statement that you have no idea of a particular thing, in no way implies that I do know. We are speaking of something and someone from centuries ago- how can anyone now claim to know the mind of that person, unless we have written evidence of their intent?"

What would it take to save parks if citizens voted no on the ballot to increase taxes for parks, roads? The solution needs a out of box thinker.  Is that wrong? Suzette without problem solving wanted to increase her own salary while neglecting crime, police and parks.  We can agree the showare was to bring in surplus funds to help?  That hasn't happened, didn't happen.  We have bigger social issues now.  Budgets get fought for.  Suzette has thick skin, knows hard leadership isn't a cake walk.  She is on her way out.  Now we need to refocus on fixing matters regarding city.  This is where we are at.  The leader, Dana, is it. She is focused on improving the city my girls live in."
"Yes, then I guess I did misread your comments. Your ""delusional Hillary supporters"" and bringing up the deplorable ""deplorables"" comment misled me.

"Ms. Patkotak's article is typical of the left's attack on any thing American, anything Trump related, or any historical issue white related.  The Indigenous Peoples Day movement ( adapted here in Alaska as well as other places) is purely racist.  Proof of that is obvious when of the 365 days of the year, Columbus Day is chosen to rename. Why wasn't the fifth day of May, MLK's birthday, or Halloween picked or just some day that had not been taken? Purely to disparage Columbus that is why.  Those in the Legislature that supported this are politically correct cowards. I for one am going to resist any of these actions that only serve as a type of genocide against our state and country's history. ISIS has been trying to destroy all the ancient artifacts, relics and books in the cradle of civilization. Those that want to rename holidays, tear down statues, rewrite text books, and rename towns and mountains are falling into the same mentality as ISIS."

Of course she did, how else was she going to have any political power, she can't do it on her own and even viciously destroyed the women he cheated with but now says that women like that should be believed. Bill was actually convicted of Contempt of Court, fined and surrendered his law license in Arkansas and removed from the Supreme court bar. During the appeal period for the Supreme Court bar, resigned. The court orders he violated were to tell the truth to the Paula Jones Grand jury. A federal judge ordered him several times to tell the truth and he did not. That is also called Perjury. Since that federal judge convicted Bill of not telling the truth to the Grand Jury, in violation of the judges orders, the house indicted him on Perjury and Obstruction of Justice. The Clintons have a history of getting away with breaking the laws."

UBI increases entrepreneurship, pulls women and the disabled from poverty and keeps local money local. 

Income inequality is the root of suffering in our modern world, driven by corporate and individual greed. That anyone is hungry or homeless anywhere is immoral. This article's headline speaks volumes, as if it's OK to let people in poverty suffer and die for lack of the basics.

"I agree, and the ""game"" is more complex than some of us are willing to admit. If, for example, a woman succumbed to Harvey Weinstein because she felt threatened or pressured, that's one thing. But if she did so because she saw it as an easy way to advance her career, that's something else.

I don't want to ever be thought of as defending a swine like Weinstein. Any person who uses a position of power to coerce others is reprehensible, whether it's Harvey Weinstein, Bill Clinton or Donald Trump. But it does need to be said that not all women are unwilling victims, and those who ""play the game"" for their own purposes are at least partially responsible for perpetuating it."
Not relevant to the topic at hand. This has nothing to do with this lawsuit. Conflation is not allowed. Moving the goal posts is not allowed.

Claiming prenatal exposure because pregnant women were working illegally in a recently sprayed field without proof is not allowed. Your studies are thus not relevant.

"Math instruction in North America has been in trouble for decades. It started with an experimental curriculum that somehow got adopted without ever being put to the test of measuring learning outcomes.

Teachers have adopted opposition to standardised testing as an article of faith, because it sheds light on teachers and on schools with teaching problems. Such testing could also issue an early alarm on fad teaching methods failing to do the job.

When the first k-12 victims of the experimental math curriculum reached post secondary schools enrolment in math intensive areas, chemistry, computing, engineering, math, physics, statistics, ... all dropped and the students that showed up were poorly grounded in math, compared to the previous year. Female enrolment in C Sc at UVic dropped from 1 in 3 to 1 in 10 from one year to the next.

It's almost like, a blind partisan is just trying to be anti-conservative everything, and in the process has made themselves look completely foolish and illogical."
"Denigrating a 17-year old girl by the comments about her weight is not 'common decency' in my judgement.  Nor is the comment about 'cocaine useage' by another young girl.  It wouldn't be 'common decency' by another 17 year old.  

By two adult and supposed ""mentors"" and role models, it is completely disgusting behavior.  

Maybe you think it is fine.  Maybe you think there is some cultural excuse for it.  

You have your standards for behavior; and I have mine."
"If that in fact happens it will be a big day for a lot of bitter, unfulfilled middle aged women."
"Admirable woman, salt of the earth family and good reporting.  I wish her the best on the sale and for her future."
"Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III scrambled aboard the ‘Trump train’ early, because Trump seemed like his best chance for a position where he could really abuse all those uppity people of color / women / liberals with impunity. And Donald J. Trump welcomed the Malevolent Leprechaun aboard, because he assumed that their shared revanchist social goals would keep ol’ Jeff from looking too closely at Don’s myriad ethical peccadilloes."
"Sure, but who else is responsible for harassing women online?  People who aren't trolls?"
"Good one.  Thanks, Mr. Quinn.  I heard the news (we've paid those tolls) and my first thought: where's the revenue stream to make up for THAT loss to the government coffers?
Got the answer now: me, and all other tax-payers.  

Mr. Quinn talks about timing.  I have a bit of a timing issue, too.  The main reason we paid the tolls was to visit a daughter and family who, not long ago, forsook the Lower Mainland (specifically, Burnaby) for the leafy tranquility of Saanich. Do I benefit now?  No.  Will seldom cross those bridges.  But my wallet takes a whack anyway.  Grrr..."
I hope Palin does sue that woman.......no one should be saying the things she said.
"That's all very interesting, but he question is why, if dialogue is so valued by NCR, that NCR seems to never engage in dialogue with conservative Catholics.   

It seems that the people truly interested in dialogue are CUA and the Koch brothers.  They are working together, whereas I'm hard pressed to think of who NCR is working with, besides a few progressive Sisters."
"Oh sure Casey Hillary lost because of the Russians, oops no, it was Comey's fault, oops no it was Anthony Weiner's fault, no oops, it was because deplorable white women hate voting for white women, no oops it was because Hillary didn't have enough money, oops - no it was the Russians ya it was Putin's fault Hillary lost.  Ya Putin wanted President Trump in office instead of a bloated, sick old stumble bum, criminal Democrat that wrecked everything she ever touched."
"You have some serious hostility toward APD. They did their job. She committed a horrendous crime. Mentally ill or not, she had to be arrested. It's up to the courts to determine what happens now. IF it's deemed she is mentally unstable, then she will get help.
It's not the police departments job to determine mental health. She broke the law... they did their job.

Thank you APD."
"It’s fine to have a blow-out in a fancy restaurant, 
With terrapin and canvas-back and all the wine you want; 
To enjoy the flowers and music, watch the pretty women pass, 
Smoke a choice cigar, and sip the wealthy water in your glass. 
It’s bully in a high-toned joint to eat and drink your fill, 
But it’s quite another matter when you 
                                                                         Pay the bill. 
Excerpt from The Reckoning by Robert Service"
"I knew Krin in the 1980s in Vancouver.  On more than one occasion her kindness and gentle honesty astonished and deeply moved me. Unassuming as she was in those days, she was also stunningly beautiful and entirely committed as a radical feminist activist helping other women. I mourn her and offer my condolences to her beloved partner, daughter, family and friends. I will never forget her."
"I see your point but I wouldn't label LW as necessarily selfish or disgusting. That's a bit harsh.  She is grieving too (probably not to the extent as the mom is) and apparently has psychiatric issues if she is on meds. I also think it is too soon--the death is still so very fresh. looks like the burial will be in a couple of months. Maybe the Rawness of the loss will lessen slightly by then and LW will be more clearheaded. Right now the death is new and LW is not coping or thinking clearly which is to be expected. LW needs to step back, calm down, and get to a place where she can be rational. Maybe go to grief therapy to get a handle on herself. LW is thinking emotionally rather than rationally she should at the very least make an appearance. As far as the mom visiting the site--she should be allowed. She doesn't have to come inside the house when visiting. Sounds like it may be a large property. The gravesite. Maybe text beforehand. If the house sells--not sure how that work."
"Oh of course, abuse of women is a liberal problem."
"James, lets not be sexist about this, It's a problem with women drivers too as they too love to drive their zippy little cars while texting and gabbing on the phone too and at 75 mph things go by pretty fast. Now that's not telling anybody how to drive is it?"
"1) there are almost no condos being built in Portland.

2) the goat blocks development is happening on a site that had been previously developed. The Lido and Monte Carlo restaurants and the wharehouse that was previously there burned down in the late 90s/early 2000s. 

3) the development happening at the old church park on 11th and Stark is low income housing for people transitioning out of homelessness and for women escaping domestic violence."
I can't imagine in a million years going into any of my children's homes and rearranging anything. But I know of women who do this. I think it's appalling and a total lack of respect. And LR is having to tolerate it to spare MIL's feelings? When do her feelings on the issue get to count?
"Especially in those cities that continued to have matriarchal tendencies, I would suppose the Queen Mother was highly exalted. However, I was not talking about 'Queen Mother,' but 'Queen of Heaven.' Read Jeremiah 7 and 44."
"The ones who have an interest are many of those whose parish has been assigned a young trad priest. When you live in a rural area with no options it is something you think about. When women and girls are removed from all functions, local musicians are removed for paid musicians who commute from out of town, you're aware. When there is no choice of which type of Mass to attend, you know. Believe me, I know."
You don't see many women on oil rigs or in mines.  These are usually six figure wage positions in good times.
"Went to Eugene today off 11th to get a truck part and some salmon hooks. I don't go there very often, so it was shocking to see the number of street people gathered in those parts now, some quite feeble, some quite in-your-face angry, mostly behaving poorly toward one another, many using the sidewalks for other than walking. It's unsettling inwardly to see the number of these scary looking people increasing, especially with winter coming on. My default is to think they made their own sandwiches, but I don't know that. 
That's the scary part, the part that makes room for me out there. 
But that being said, my wife doesn't see well: ""get off the sidewalk jack-ass, save your sad story for somebody else."""
"Again conservatives show there are only pro-birth, not pro-life. If a woman gets unintentionally pregnant, no matter what income, conservatives will move heaven and Earth to make sure that baby is born, after which, the pregnancy was a poor life decision and is no longer a conservatives problem and any help the woman receives is now ""stealing"" money."
"I care and so do many other folks who are opposed to discrimination of whole ""classes"" of our citizens, for whatever reason.  This was an organization formed as a later part of the Civil Rights movement...the founders are famous...for their work against the Klan...(a group strongly supporting Trump) 

And I very very clearly support efforts to protect these classes of our citizens....be they black,  Jewish, female, gay et al. Think God calls us to do it.

I am amazed that you are not supportive of such protections too....think it's at the essence of Christianity."
"Don't give up on Ah Mow or the team!  New team, new coach, new system.  Imua Wahine!

One bit of advice.  Ah Mow must realize that she is now representing and leading top class program.  She should be tough on the team in practice but be positive of the players in public.  Also a small point.  I know she wants to show that she is local but wearing a T-shirt makes her look like a ball girl not the head coach.  She has to show the same style as our world class program.  Shoji was local but we never saw him wearing shorts and t-shirt on the court during the game. Just my observation. Still love the coach and team."
"Sergio was horrible, but 100% better than the woman announcer and Rex Ryan. They were awful. I refuse to watch my sport of choice while having gender equality jammed down my throat."
"""historic Canadian values are worth protecting.”

Like the values that led hundreds of thousands of people over three generations to Queen-and- Country (1890s) King-and-Country (1914; 1939) to war? 

Like the values that allowed Canada to shrug off the forced resettlement of thousands of Japanese Canadians, losing all they owned, into distant internment camps? 

...that allowed the Canadian government to turn away as Churches confiscated and then abused thousands of Aboriginal children?

that were demonstrated by the Canadian government as it limited Jewish refugees and turned away hundreds just after WW II?

that encouraged scientists to dehumanize individuals and render them guinea pigs in drug and chemical ordeals?

that trumpeted ""eugenics"", the mass sterilization of the psychologically impaired, in the bizarre belief that doing so would ""weed out"" the mental illness?

that touted the notion that women were not ""people"" and so could not hold office or vote?"
"Gives a whole new meaning to a phrase that abounded in my convent boarding school days:

""Crude, rude and socially unattractive!""

I see they have removed Bannions exceedingly vulgar reference to feminists.....that you cited...I feel sure it will turn up in the larger culture....it was ugly, and very very sadly indicative of this revolting administration.....and folks will ""get it""......

Our poor country..."
"Fox, like CNN, spends all their time putting two to five shouters on each edge of the table.  Everyone talks over everyone else.  Gave up on both of them years ago.   

OPB, though liberal in tone,  at least allows people to present somewhat different viewpoints.  

You know, PBS, where a columnist said that there was ""Parity of Sleaze"" between Donald and Hillary during the campaign,   I thought that was a pretty accurate characterization.

It was more fun watching CBS on election night as all of the partisan news folks were deer in the headlights crying in their Perrier as the results came in.  

Watched his interview on ABC? with one of their women anchors several days ago in Trump Tower.  The one where he decided on the spot that he wouldn't take a salary even after they told him how much it was.  Seemed like an ok interview to me.   As he has been wandering around signing all the stuff in this editorial, he seemed to be fine to me.

You are confusing your hopes with reality again."
"Here is what Trump has said: ""I've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy,'' Trump once said about the convicted sex offender. ""He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -- Jeffrey enjoys his social life.""

“Mark Epstein, Jeffrey's brother, testified in 2009 that Trump flew on Jeffrey's private jet""

""Both Trump and Epstein are named as sex abusers in a case with an under-aged girl.""

Here is what Epstein has said in testimony:
Q. Have you ever socialized with Donald Trump in the presence of females under the age of 18?
A: Though I'd like to answer that question, at least today I'm going to have to assert my Fifth, Sixth, and 14th Amendment rights, sir.

It sounds like Bill has the higher count of instances, but they both seemed to be part of the scene."
"and this proves that the ""so called"" pro-life movement isn't pro-life and could care less about stopping abortion.   they are only concerned about amassing money and power.   and it's followers, like Trump and his, are nothing more than tools to achieve that money and power.   if they were truly interested in stopping abortion, they would stop wasting their time on these meaningless marches and stuff, and actually do something that works, like providing free or low cost contraception, REAL reproductive education and none of the abstinence crap that does not work and never will, and work to see that all women have adequate healthcare and childcare and job training.    That is how you will stop abortion, not by making it illegal or trying to control it."
"The words I read in the article are ""offered"", ""assist"", etc. In addition, we all know about the repetitive mantra of ""white monopoly capital"". 
There are any number of funds specifically for prev. disadv. business start-ups. Some of them are:

We live in a free capitalist system. My question to the author is: why, after 23 years, and with all the assistance noted above, is only 15% of formal business in the hands of an 80% majority? 

Instead of whingeing about WMC, go out, take the advantages given to you by the ANC govt, and create your own formal businesses and your own dreams.

The ANC may be corrupt, but if anything, the ANC is giving special advantage to black dreams."
"Bielski' headline seems to mean ""why do these other women say things I disagree with"".

Personally I think Paglia's and the others views she disapprovingly refers to are a breath of fresh air."
"The Women's March was primarily about the access to birth control and abortion and against Trump's misogynism. Birth control and abortion are available in Russia and, as far as I know, not about to be restricted by Putin.  Also, the Russians may not be aware of the Women's Marches given the state control of media, and it is in the middle of winter which can be very cold there. Women in most Muslim countries don't have many rights so they don't hold marches."
If you are married and I told you the wife you were living with wasn't your wife you wouldn't take offense?
"But he endorses the idea of complementarianism; they all do.  That is the issue; you cannot be for women's equality and be a complementarian.  Also, both Cupich and Good Tobin would likely support Pope Francis' bizarre comments on gender theory."
"Another well thought out argument from one of the Hillary supporters... Thank you for proving my point for me, Miss!"
"Sadly, your words ring true rather than facetious.  It was much more important to keep women from being sex objects and using retreats to warn teenage females about the dangers of French kissing, going steady, and, in short, having anything at all to do with sex.  All sexual misconduct was caused by ""The Pill"" and the baby boomers.  Since Bishops presumably never took ""The Pill,"" then how can they be held accountable for misconduct regarding sexual behavior?"
"Sure Ed, however if a teenaged girl asks to participate in these prayers she will be barred from the room, especially at certain times of the month.  And this whole argument is supposed to be about equal accommodations?"

McMaster,  aide Hope Hicks, deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders and National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton will all be traveling to Europe with Trump

Impeach Trump Now.


Oh, and guess who isn't going? Kellyanne Conway. She'll be right here, spinning “alternative facts” and possibly making some key merchandise sales from the White House."
"Yes, this lady has developed a reputation as a very poor liar. First her Benghazi lies and now this. Based on what she did in the past even when it becomes clear that she knows more than she's telling she sticks to her lies. No wonder she's one of Obama's trusted confidants."
"You're a great mom. I am the maker of a daughter with two rare diseases. We are makers of the strong whilst we may feel weak. We are makers of the brave, we are  makers of unconditional love. Hang in there."
As opposed to Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski this chick makes me feel good inside my eyes
"There are plenty of reasons Trump was elected, but the following are two big ones.

Illegal immigration. While many Trump supporters are racists and bigots, it's not racist to simply be against illegal immigration.  Many ordinary Americans, including many Dems simply would like their government to enforce immigration laws.  When these workers hear many Democrats discuss immigration what they hear is people who seem to believe in open-borders and act as if the law of supply and demand don't apply to labor. You can support a pathway to citizenship for the undocumented immigrants who have made lives here and still support legal hiring practices and secure borders.

Islam. In their quest for inclusion and tolerance most liberals refused to make the connection between actions and beliefs. So, as Muslims continue to carry out horrific attacks and oppress women around the world, they understandably believe that liberals refuse to accept a reality that's required to address the problem."
"Hello Crispina, I now post using my own name.  I am proud of the ethical and logical balance of all my comments. Do you know what you are talking about, specifically? What is your complaint? When I posted as jjp58, I did not claim to be a woman, I was ambiguous.

I think you are nothing but a trouble-making troll. Unless you have specific charges against me, which so far you do not, I suggest that you buzz off, and good riddance, troll from who knows where."
"It is the mother's choice. It should remain the mother's choice after birth, too. We might have been spared a Trump."
That's why they invented intersection feminism - so they could justify the multiple prejudice hierarchy.
My daughter attended the lax camp all three years and we appreciate and love Patti Bell.  She is a great role model for our daughters and we will miss her when she is away at college.  I hope all kids of all ages learn something from her commitment to help others and the sacrifice of her time for others.  Thank you Patti Bell and Congratulations!!
"I don't see it as a step forward.  I see it as deflection of the real issue which is the ordination of women.  Only if women can be ordained will it be possible to truly""involv[e] women at various levels in the church."" As we well know, advisory panels in the Church tend to be window dressing."
"Very aware, since I provided groceries and visited with both of them regularly over the past few years. Before he was missing, I was on the verge of asking for a wellfare check due to the deterioration of this home. It is extremely hard to make the determination as to when it is necessary to infringe on someone's personal freedom and to have them removed. I challenge anyone to really find that gray line. I not only reported him as missing and spent many hours with the Sheriff department explaining the situation. Mental illness is often overlooked and both of these individuals struggled with this issue. My hope now is that at least the woman is able to get some relief from this tourture. The deceased was a very nice person and told me that he did not feel that he would live much longer. He refused a ride to the hospital twice in the past month."
Why even put the complaints of a ranting black woman in the news.  She was kick off the plane for being a loud obnoxious passenger.  Nothing to do with the color or her skin.  Absurd!

"Actually, the DOW is at about where it was on December 13 under Obama, and well below the highs in December and January under Obama. Your opinion (and it is only YOUR opinion) that ""it is all good and going to get better"" is not even a majority opinion. 

We have some whiners in our nation, which has been GREAT for a long-long time; but most who object to The Donald anywhere but on a TV screen showing a reality entertainment for dummies, aren't ""whiners"", porn users as you so insultingly say (maybe you use porn) or video gamers (gosh, that's just SOOOO Sinful!), and what's wrong with watching movies? What are you, a conservative Muslim who thinks drinking, dancing, women's unveiled faces, and depictions of the human face or form is forbidden? Most of us, as you have seen, are willing to stand up to a psychotic tyrant like Donald J. Trump, who only knows how to use bankruptcy to enrich himself, and feel up teen beauty contestants."

"FBI despises Flynn for, among other things, supporting a female FBI agent in her harassment claims against Deputy FBI Dir Andrew McCabe. Sounds to me like trumped-up charge."
"Police protection?  So in Girdwood, we have been living without any real police protection like in most places in Anchorage.  If you need the police because of a burglary or anything else that does not involve an active shooter....get ready to wait....and wait...and wait. The decision to get Whittier Police ""protection"" passed by three votes!  So now I get to pay over $700.00 a year more property tax to get basically nothing!  I voted against the proposal feeling that I can get more protection myself than hiring the Whittier cops.  We need law and order restored in this country but the police in most cities are only reactionary in most crimes that don't involve an active shooter. So whose fault is that? Look at the current President of the United States and the woman who hopes to replace him!  The police are not allowed to do their job in the best of circumstances. The federal government doesn't have their back anymore.....so what are we taxpayers getting for our money?  Peace of mind?"

The fact that they often look like a sack full of doorknobs I can understand.  You gotta cover up the cellulite and the varicose veins somehow.  

But why the extraneous labeling?"
"Kind of a refreshing piece, but it falls short.

There are two failure elephants in the conservative room.  He only acknowledged one - the right-wing fear-mongering media (Limbaugh, Fox, etc.).

The other elephant is social conservatives.  The evangelicals.  This group has hijacked the conservative agenda and focused it on unrelated topics such as abortion, gay stuff, and willful ignorance of basic science (evolution, climate change, etc.).  This 'christian' group endorsed Donald Trump - enough said.

The republicans recruited and nurtured that evangelical puppy, and now that it's turned into a 120 lbs snarling, biting, smelly, defecating mongrel sleeping on the furniture, they don't know what to do with it. 

It's one thing to recognize the problem.  Fixing it is another matter.  For the sake of the country I hope they do, but I'm not holding out any hope."

"I have mixed feelings about this change. On the one hand, Lady Liberty is the Statue of Liberty, a gift to our young country from France and an internationally recognized symbol of freedom and liberty for all the peoples of the world, regardless of race or ethnicity, which has graced our coins ever since she arrived in New York. I have no problem with depictions of the races that make up our vibrant ethnic diversity, I am not so sure about those depictions being an alternative Lady Liberty. I have heard that there will be follow on coins depicting hispanics, natives and asians to be released in the future and in my opinion, that will be a good thing. I just have an issue with presenting anyone other than Lady Liberty as Lady Liberty. There is only one Lady Liberty and she is a beautiful statue located in New York."
"I can tell you Mrs. Katie Sales was a very good driver. Had probably left from a weekend of visiting her Granddaughter and Great Granddaughter who live in Bend.

"And today's 9th Circuit illegal alien conviction is ""Defendant-Appellant Doroteo Rocha-Alvarado appeals the district court’s imposition of a sixteen-level sentencing enhancement to his conviction of illegal reentry after deportation in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.  We conclude that the district court did not err in applying the sixteen-level enhancement because, under the modified categorical approach, Rocha-Alvarado’s prior conviction for attempted sexual abuse in the first degree pursuant to Oregon Revised Statutes § 163.427(1)(a) qualifies as a “crime of violence"".""

Rocha-Alvarado was charged with three counts of attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, alleging that on or between March 24, 2012, and August 29, 2012, he subjected a nine-year-old girl to sexual contact by touching her vagina, breast, and lips.

He was deported in 2013 and this is his sentence for coming back in after deportation."

But when the situation is reversed, Hate Crime charges are very, very rare against Blacks when the victims are White.  Why is that?  Whatever happened to ""equal protection under the law""?

"Please dig into that book. There are clear errors and gaps in understanding above.

Evidence of original sin is rich in both the OT and NT, humans with imperfect dominion over their faculties, a will that vacillates, an intellect that cannot see the truth because the senses have clouded its view of moral matters, a body that complains moving the will against the good.

Then there are particular references - all well before ""Augustine"" to the condition.

When David says in Psalms: ""Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin my mother conceived me."" he was referring to what the Church eventually termed Original Sin.

When Saint Paul....again well before Saint Augustine says in Ephesians that all people who are not in Christ are “sons of disobedience”  he was referring to the condition of Original Sin. The name came later.

I could go on but I implore you to stop ""teaching"" and pick up that book, setting aside the pride of a little knowledge, and go get a lot more"
"So let's take everyone's health care down to poor health care as long as everyone has something? I planned my healthcare knowing I would have it for life as a military retiree. I made it a career for the training, job experience, GI Bill, healthcare and commissary privileges.  Did you have the opportunity to serve Ken?  You too, as well as almost anyone else, could have chosen the same path had they cared to prepare for their future by sacrificing in their youth.

 I also supplement that with private care from my wife's company's plan. She got her PhD while following me around the world for 23+ yrs.  Almost anyone could do that too if they were dedicated enough.  Oh and she isn't a privileged white person. She was married at 16 and our son was born at 17. She dropped out and got her GED.  Yes, anyone with self discipline can do it.  It's called working for what you want/need."
"The single mother, who is a minority per your comment, has every right to the housing which you describe - that's clearly established. There is absolutely no requirement that the landlord must further accommodate her by painting the words ""Single mothers are my favorite,"" on the front of her house. The landlord is obligated, as you know since you work in EEO (did you mean EEOC?) law, to provide equal (and equal in every way - the amenities, rent, condition, etc.. must be equivalent to what the other tenants are also receiving. He can't charge her more if she receives less, and he can't restrict her living arrangements and options because of any class protection which she is duly entitled to) housing. There is NOTHING that says the landlord must make extra accommodations, cosmetically or aesthetically, to her, based on her class. That's what this is about. The baker offered to bake the cake, he offered to sell the cake - as he's required to do. No law dictates what the baker must write!"
The 22-25 year old teachers (predominately women) who get into the PERA system in 2020 will probably live to at least the age of 90.  That's 25 years post 65.  Not many pension systems can handle that kind of actuarial liability.

"Conservatives need to own the fact that they don't find racist, misogynist and homophobic speech worthy of censure because they usually agree with it.

All their protests about defending freedom of speech are just camouflage. They know a simple fact: that values, even bad ones, die w/out speech. 

Political Correctness has come to mean ""censorship"". But what it really entails is opposition to white supremacism, misogyny and homophobia, values that, supposedly, run counter to the American grain.

To preserve Constitutional liberties, then, opponents of ""PC"" would preserve values that threaten to undo the Republic. Well done . . ."
"Dear dear AnonAJ ... who was it who said the world would be saved by beauty. I've quit tv and most online. I heard an interview with a very wise woman who said she has turned to magazines.

I hear and bear witness to those who are trying to help thru nonviolence.

"There are about 36,000 rapes per year in the USA, and far less that cause a pregnancy. And yes, John, enough couples who would be happy to adopt them.

In response to your service as a rape counselor, I would have thought that's your job to explain to the women raped that carrying the child to term isn't a punishment of them at all. That God still has a purpose for them and their child in life, regardless of what a criminal has done to them.  In God's eyes, they are still pure and untouched. In such circumstances, killing the child isn't going to make the rape go away. Instead, bringing the child to term is a chance to bring a new and perfect life into the world from a violent assault.

A baby is everything that is good about the world, whereas rape is everything that's evil. To associate the former with the latter is to mislead the rape victim. Our culture has permitted abortion since 1970, makes it seem as if a baby is a burden, an expense and an inconvenience in life."

 I find that statement very sad and difficult to understand. There was Marie travelling over and back to Rome from Dublin, which she hated because it meant she was away from her family"" . She was giving of her all, to prevent what happened to her; happening to other children. She had the highest credentials to be on that commission following an invitation from Pope Francis. Marie had previously been invited to make presentations  and give inputs  on training courses for newly appointed bishops, at the Vatican.

To think Pope Francis did not take the time to talk to Marie once, at a personal level during her time on the commission is beyond belief. It raises a lot of questions."

"The poor treatment of the homeless is the same in most of the country. The surge of homelessness is secondary to neoliberal economics and is going to get worse under Clinton or Trump. The non-profit industrial complex was built up to take advantage of the federal grants for homelessness, the admin staff make good money, but constantly claim lack of funds for the homeless. CSS should have been removed from BFS long ago, the city council, Berkowitz and staff are using BS to manipulate the public while going after the homeless. They say nice things, but do bad things. The claims of less homeless people by Obama are false manipulations. All over the county cities have democrat mayors abusing the homeless under the guise of altruism, running them out of camps, telling the public they have services which do not exist. The evidence here is they all can't fit in that filthy, bed bug ridden bullying BFS where drunks and noise keep people, especially the women from sleeping."

"This is an interesting story. The injuries on the dog don't look life-threatening; I'm guessing that he was already old. However, her burns look serious and painful. The reason I believe that this happened is because I've had Starbucks cups collapse and spill on me, but the coffee wasn't hot enough to cause these kinds of severe burns. The cups and tops don't always fit. Starbucks should have learned a lesson from the McDonalds hot coffee lawsuit, where a cup of super-heated coffee almost killed an elderly woman."
"""The women's menstrual cycles.....""  At the time this was seriously considered as a possible cause. Well maybe it was to some degree. I'll tell you what I have experienced with little lead way for discrediting this factor. We went in, 2005, and set up a permitted camp on an island for the 10th year. Bears were always around nightly. Fishing from our boats, Walking by our cook tent and thru camp nightly. Never a problem. We set up our guide's tent and dug a deep crapper hole close to his tent because his wife would make him go with her to pee at night. We put a pop up tent over the crapper box with comfortable seat.  She arrives that evening. She was menstruating and peed in the hole and disposed of her tampon in the fresh hole, 2.5 feet deep. That night the bear came in and knocked down the tent overturned the box and reached down into the hole and pulled out the tampon. And left.  From then on she burned everything in the tent stove. The bear obviously reacted in this case, ladies."

"Tompaine:  I really wish your statements were true.

You mention ""the relatively few who would work if they had resources to become employed and if THEY DIDN'T SUFFER FROM SOME SORT OF EMOTIONAL CONDITION MAKING ANY PROFESSIONAL INTERACTION IMPOSSIBLE.""

"As I wrote - people have an expectation that they can go about their business and activities in public and work environments without being harassed, and that expectation is supported by law.   The woman was on the job, and the passenger's comments were ""unwanted verbal . . . conduct of a sexual nature that creates . . . [an] offensive environment.""   The airline, as her employer, cannot legally require that she overlook or endure such behavior, even from the passengers.  On the contrary . . . it could make them liable and vulnerable to a lawsuit if they required employees to allow that behavior.

Furthermore, I have no doubt that the passenger's behavior and behaviors like it have been addressed in the crew's training at length, because it's their job.  She was not able to have him removed so readily because she was easily ""offended.""  He was removed quickly because his behavior was much worse than just ""childish"" or in ""poor taste,"" and others at her job agreed with her."

The biogenic gas has a distinct isotopic signature from the thermal gas.

The fact that it has gone so far indicates to me that she is pursuing this case out of obstinance and ignorance."

Trump jumped into the presidential race after a private phone call with Bill Clinton that was made just three weeks before his announcement. Clinton encouraged him to play a bigger role in the Republican party. He has showered her Senate campaigns with contributions on four separate occasions as well as being a donor to her 2008 presidential campaign. In 2012, after Clinton had been secretary of state for over three years, he told Fox News that she was a “terrific woman . . . she really works hard and I think she does a good job.” Let that sink in for a min.

Those who are in favor of women's ordination are WAY behind the times. We are entering into the time when all things are to be restored through the Elijah Message: tithes and offerings, festivals, tassels, head coverings and long dresses for women, etc. Straight testimony to the Laodiceans is now going forth and the shaking is coming; those who are faithful to the Scriptures will remain, while those who do not remain true to Bible standards will be cast out of the SDA remnant church."

"Both sides tend to paint each other with pretty broad strokes, so lets not play pretend here shall we.
The general GOP stance on issues like birth control, abortion and ""handouts"" is that the GOP is quite firmly against all of those things. They dont want to fund places that do abortions. They agree with business being allowed to not only restrict what types of birth control their healthcare plans offer, but even more recently the Republicans in Missouri proposed legislation that would allow a company to fire a woman who even uses birth control. And in general, the GOP is against ""handouts"" or ""entitlements"" and wants to reduce the number of people being supported by those programs, without any solutions on what to do with those people once they are no longer supported.

"This idea that you should win because you were so so so passionate is silly. You win by organizing, by registering to vote and voting.

"This was terrible advice. You don't dump your friends for a new girlfriend, and you don't especially dump your friends when the new person demands it. 

At least one of you should have said 'well, maybe you could meet his girlfriend and talk to her about it.' Buuut no. You instead went 'WELP. NEW GIRLFRIEND WINS. Friendship over. Get over it.""  This is terrible advice. This is -TERRIBLE- advice! Control of outside contacts is the first thing an abusive person does in a relationship. I'm not saying that his girlfriend is an abusive person, but you don't know if she is or not. Her behavior is controlling. That is not good for anyone.

Good advice would have been. "" Hey, extend the olive branch. Talk to his new girlfriend. Alleviate her worries and try to make friends with her. If she refuses, then she's obviously not interested in compromising on anything with her new beau. Talk to your friend afterwards.""    Good lord, you two."

The US has a TFR of 1.9, but that is only due to hispanic women, who will one day reproduce at the same rate as white and black women, which is at about 1.3. In the advanced nations we are facing a demographic winter."
"I for one Canadian wants NAFT reopened and some Canada first policy put in place.  My first paragraph will say. Canada is open for business with the US, but the US will pay International price for every good and service it buys (notice not takes) from Canada. Be it Canada Oil, Canada Gas, Wood, water air, it does not matter they can have all they want at the international price, but first Canada needs to meet its own needs. This means, the 600'000 barrels of oil imported into eastern Canada every day will stop immediately. Coal burning power plants will be upgraded to burn Canada gas immediately, and this is just the start. No more money to the Saudi's to fund the Muslim religious war, natural gas will feed Canada coal plants first before we continue to feed the US thermal plants. These are big change but the US has to understand we are not their whore, we are Canada!!!! Everybody in Canada will be working, including the Indians, everybody will have cheaper everything."
"Ms Alicestine October, I fully agree with you that the descendants of the “first people” must get recognition of their ancestors and their full rights restored.
I would also expect that within this new awakening of pride and place, that the name Krotoa would be given to new born baby girls, instead of the strange unpronounceable names we encounter every day.  Have you ever met someone in SA with the name Krotoa?
It is also a fact that many whites in SA share the same ancestors: Krotoa’s descendants married Europeans and not the indigenous people of the Cape.
I think the filming of Dalene Mathee’s well researched and imaginative rich historical novel, Pieternella van die Kaap, and Dan Sleigh’s Eilande (both translated into Dutch and English), would create a better understanding and sympathy for the real Krotoa van Meerhof, than the present film with its out of context pc statements and “metaphorical” rape scenes supposedly to encourage debate...."

I scold the city for making housing LESS affordable. Since the city wants to amend the Urban Renewal District, and divert up to $48 million AWAY from schools and city provided services, I expect the city manager to propose more property tax measures when the services (pools, Cahoots, libraries, ect.) are cut due to a depleted general fund.

Increased property taxes make housing more expensive for everybody, including low income renters. The city (mayor, city manager, and half of the council) do not care. Funding their pet projects in the downtown are more important than providing services, living-up to their stated goals of making housing more affordable (so they say), and honoring their 2010 promise of terminating the URD. They are proving themselves to be liars!"

"In today's National Post,

But not all women who’ve worn niqabs feel positively about them.
When the niqab is there, the woman is absent. She's like a ghost

 
Ensaf Haidar, the wife of imprisoned blogger Raif Badawi, says she had to wear the niqab in Saudi Arabia at times because it was mandatory.
She feels niqabs are a way of erasing women from public view and says she doesn’t believe they have a place in Canada or Quebec.
“When the niqab is there, the woman is absent,” she said in a phone interview. “She’s like a ghost.”
Haidar lives in Sherbrooke, Que. with her three children as she fights for the release of her husband, who is serving a 10-year prison sentence for his criticism of Saudi clerics.
She says she doesn’t believe wearing the niqab can be a choice and hopes to see it gone from Canada one day.
“We came here to be free,” Haidar said. “We’re here because there are a lot of things we can’t do in our country.”
“I am here and I am free and I am me.”"

I posted an excerpt and a url showing that this was wrong.  Nothing more.

You replied with (a) some kind of insult to feminists, even though women had not been mentioned at all; and (b) statistics about white people, even though that also had not been mentioned.

I questioned why the figures about whites was important to you because in the circumstances it was odd.  I could have asked the same question about feminists.

You went ballistic.

I think that covers it."

"I suppose Rachel Rich that you are OK with the schools we have now if I read your letter right. I think the current state of public education to be poor at best. If your ""public schools for all"" idea is implemented all the private schools like the one the Obama girls go will close and they will be dragged off to the wonderful schools in D.C. Any parent can sacrifice and make their child's future better with a decent education. The public schools (most not all) are failing our kids. They learn how to protest and to embrace deviant lifestyles but can not read or think critically. 
I hope the best for all American kids and would like to see some sort of choice for them. I realize the only choice that is acceptable to the teachers union is the one that forces all kids to attend their failing schools."

Would you like me to furnish you a link to his infamous ""Billie Bush"" video wherein he demonstrates his ""respect"" for women?  Would you like a link to the videos of the primary campaign debates where he insults everyone else on stage?  Mr. Trump's marked lack of respect for others has been on display for decades....In fact, for many of his supporters, it has been a ""positive"".  They like the fact that he openly displays the disrespect they feel but are too cowardly to show.  

You comment that ""progressives are bad people.""  That's a gross generalization and a mass condemnation of tens of millions of Americans.  If we're to ""judge"" persons as GOOD or BAD, let's use some objective criteria.  For example, do you have any actual evidence that ""progressives"", either as a group or as individuals, even start to compare with Trump in terms of demonstrtating extreme disrespect for others?"

"I can't remember the exact date, but last fall when the story of the veil was in the news in Quebec, I observed a veiled woman at a shopping mall.  She just stood outside the H&M door near the mall entrance for at least 15 minutes, holding her cell phone, but not speaking into it. I thought that perhaps she was waiting for someone, but after a period of time, she just left the mall. 

I had the impression that she was there  expecting to invoke some type of reaction and take a photo, but no one took the bait.

Sure enough, I saw her again in the parking lot, where she took off her veil, got in her car and drove away."

She was wrong, of course, but she was a mean lady, and a malignant narcissist."
"The real key to the success of women investors if whether or not they fall for the so-called financial advisors (oops, I mean shysters).  All I can say is don't do it, unless you want to give someone money to manage your money and not be held liable for their mistakes.  Instead, get an S&P index fund or better yet, buy and hold 5 or 6 quality stocks.  So, women, go forward, invest, make lots of money, and don't waste your time with so-called financial advisors."
"Well said.

"Let's start collecting data to compare immigrant women from different cultural/religious groups, one group wearing face covering and the other  without, with all other variables the same, e.g., age, education, the province they have landed and stayed.

Let's set our animosity for some religions aside. Just focus on the women's well-being. 

This data should have been collected and compared."
"Yeah, the public is advised to look for a descriptive bright yellow truck w/chrome bumper driven by ""a woman"".

"What we learn from looking at nature is the amazing diversity in gender roles, even outright switching of ‘typical’ roles in some species. I actually don't see any ""rule"" that gender has to express in any particular way across species. There isn't always sexual reproduction -- many species have asexual reproduction. In humans, there are gender differences at the level of gametes and plumbing and hormones and such, but there are vast areas of social interaction where no gender roles are necessary and would be harmful to the development of the individual, and would deprive society of the gifts of the individual. What are you suggesting, that there is a rule that women should be confined to certain activities, and this is the will of 'nature's god' -- with exceptions? I think our identity is that we are 'made in the image of God,' and all of our Being is rooted in Mystery, not in some weird sexist interpretation of biology, with sexist rules."
You could also overlay similar data to the number of aboriginals in jail. Or to the number of murdered aboriginal women. Yes they have serious problems that their leadership isn't really addressing.
Just like you and your ilk after witnessing the 'Sea of Red' in October 2015.
"I don't see the problem with a stigma being attached to someone having a abortion.  That person killed their future child.  Period.  That was the plan.  Then again, I think the notion that we scold the doctors for doing abortions & not the woman having them is silly.  By not holding a woman responsible for her actions, we imply that women are incapable of making a rational decision about the medical procedures they obtain.  The closet feminist in me finds that most insulting."

Actually, there is a direct correlation between the Obama presidency and the deterioration of race relations in America. Hate for whites increased among immigrants and other groups. 

As far civility and reasoned debate are concerned the Liberal dominated media and liberal politicians and their ""field"" representatives are the ones responsible for the degradation of political, expression, or expression itself, in America. Did you see the women's march after Trump's election. The same goes for the overall decline in civility. Trump has had nothing to do with these matters.

"In addition to sexually assaulting women, Trump is a white supremacist. Both his current and former campaign managers have deep ties to white supremacist groups and both have coopted anti-Semitic and/or white supremacist hate messaging and materials for use in Trump's campaign. He has done nothing to stop violence toward minorities at his rallies but more ominously, he has said nothing to condemn or contradict his surrogates' calls for violence towards minorities and government employees in the event of a Trump loss. Trump regularly receives outside support from Russian advisors and insiders very close to Putin. The head of Trump's campaign organization is married to Alexander Gagin's personal translator. Gagin, in case you dont know, is Putin's main ideologue and advocates a nazi like ""cleansing"" of non-ethnic Europeans (yes, including Jews) from Europe. He basically wants to be the Russian Heinrich Himmler.  In short, dont vote for Trump he is a white supremacist Russian Trojan horse"
"I don't know what Francis means by ""you must take things as they come.""  As often happens, his lack of clarity invites misunderstanding.

If Francis is instructing us to approach sinners this way --- aren't we all? --- who could argue?  If on the other hand, he is advocating situation ethics, there would obviously be a lot more to say."

"There is another aspect to this discussion that few talk about and that is that people are concerned with burkas because of its connection to the radical ideology of Islam as taught in Islamic religious schools or Madrassas run by the Wahhabis, the sect of Islam supported by the Saudis and the guardians of Mecca. It is this ideology that requires that women wear Burkas. Hillary Clinton recognized this as she said in her speech after the Orlando massacres;

""For starters, it is long past time for the Saudis, the Qataris and the Kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations. And they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism""

Accordingly, another reason Canadians may be against Burkas is the link of Burkas to the radical ideology of the Wahhabis, which according to a Wahhabi Imam, is similar to that of ISIS, per a recent article."

"Saw the video many times & like the Deedy/Elderts shooting at the Waikiki McD's would attribute fault at 50/50.  It appears the Castilles were so mistrusting of cops, they created a self-fulfilling prophecy of getting shot by police, including the wife filming the shooting.  The driver did not follow instructions of the cop when he said do not reach for his weapon.  Many are saying the driver was reaching for his ID but the officer does not know this so the best thing is keep your hands & arms STILL.  What is telling is the woman's baby child had to tell her mother to stop resisiting or doing things that would result in police exerting force on her.  In hindsight when the driver was NOT following voice commands to keep his hands in plain sight, the cop could have retreated & taken a defensive position behind the Castilles car as he had another officer as backup.  It appears the justice system did the right thing in not finding the cop innocent of murder, but rightfully fired."
"Contract law does not automatically relieve you of liability for contracts entered into while drunk. This case is an example. The drunk woman contacted with the cab driver to provide her with transportation home, for which she agreed to pay the meter amount.

"Had a similar experience at one of the big mall stores specializing in undergarments...featuring pouting silken-haired young women falling out of undersized underwear in the display window and on posters.

I'm not fat, but am well-endowed enough to require some engineering help in the brassiere dept.

The gum-snapping young sales associate told me there was nothing in the store to fit me. Apparently if your bosoms are of a certain generous size, manufacturers seem to think the rest of you is large as well, hence no bra to fit big boobs attached to a small back. A DD-cup was not to be found in a 34 band size. At least not in that store.

In a similar way he ruins it by associating himself with racism directly and indirectly. Abortion is pure discrimination.  So it is to me not so clear that Trump helps the pro-life cause.  Trump lends renewed credibility to the notion that fascism is the road to Catholic values. That is in itself most dangerous.
"What your argument seems to be missing when discussing the right of individuals and free will is the fact that abortion is not a solitary action, but takes the life of another. Trying to buffer this by focusing on the ""choice"" of the mother (and yes, she's a mother when pregnant) and not considering the cost in human life has far greater consequences than personal rights.

Unfortunately there are too many organizations and politicians who profit from ""choice"" to effectively move public opinion away from abortion."
Not sure I can agree.  She won the nomination for one of the 2 contending parties in the US and she garnered  60% of the popular vote.  It wasn't being female that lost her the race it was the electoral college system and the rigging of districts.  America clearly indicated at the ballot box that they were willing to accept a female president.
"Finally, someone wishes prayers of healing over the woman. God Bless you, thank you."
"Mechanization of farming removed the need for millions of farm workers in the early 20th century. Yet the world population rose rapidly after that, and most of the people still had jobs.

While the world population growth rate has to come down significantly, the larger problem has been that the least capable people are more likely to become parents. In Canada and the US, the teenage pregnancy rate is two to eight times the rate in European countries. Those kids will likely not do too well in the future. 42 percent of children born in the US are to single mothers. They are likely to drop out of school, become career criminals, never go to college, never have well paying jobs, etc"
"Of what use is Lynn Beyak on the public payroll.  She's a loon who uses the very generous pay cheque we give her to stand on her evangelical soapbox spouting lies.   Like Don Meredith and Rob Anders, Beyak is a complete waste of tax dollars. She contributes nothing to the greater good."

"I thought this  opinion was well written, balanced and accurate.  I did not like the title and entered into reading a little defensive.       I tragically became a single father of a 5 year old girl nine years ago.  The experience has taught me much about myself.  I think i have done a pretty good job but I am cognizant of the fact that my daughter was raised very differently than had her mother been around.  Part of that was the things that were needed that I was never socialized to know about and had to learn (I can now braid hair...kind of).  Part were things that were genetic like conflict resolution.  Other single parents likely faced different hurdles but in my individual experience this article described it well.  It does beg the reverse question however.  While I don't doubt there is gender discrimination in the workplace, I do wonder if at least some of the disparity in gender representation in male dominated careers does not arise from similar innate differences."
"I wrote “The Church does not teach that is ‘led by the Infallible’.”, not “the Church does not teach infallibility”.

You still need to define what you mean by genocide, and then you need to provide the reasoning you followed to that conclusion, before waxing large on “babies, pregnant women, whatever”.

It becomes clearer and clearer why you have been avoiding actual discussions."
"I think women are really dumb if they vote for hillary just because she's a woman.  Ladies, remember one thing, this has nothing to do with improving your lives, it has everything to do with her improving hers and her going down in history, its all about her ego also.  Anyone voting in this election is a fool because both are not worthy at all of holding office and i truly believe anyone who has had as many first lady posts as hillary has no right to run for president. She's never known what its like to be poor.  She's lived a fantasy and indulgent life more than any other woman out there."
"Let's avoid another 100 posts about abortion.  Can we, at least, acknowledge that both medical science and most religions in the world do not view the start of life in the same way as what is articulated here.  Add to this that even catholic politicians must govern in a pluralistic society and aim for the common good - not the position of the catholic church.  Would recommend that folks go back a few months and re-read what Cathy Kaveny wrote at dotCommonweal - essentially, too many catholics have an almost *cultic* viewpoint when it comes to contraception or even abortion and that cultic viewpoint violates Dignitatis Humanae from VII."

"If some Muslim women make the choice to wear the Hijab - respect it.  I don't care for tattoos, piercings, or false eyelashes, but choice is key.  Many Iranian Muslims have debated the Hijab extensively since their revolution in 1979.  Originally, it was a backlash against the Shah - who banned the head scarf offending traditional Iranian women.  It became a symbol of resistance.  After the 79 revolution, and then it became mandatory under Khomeini, and even the most active opposition faced the ""whore"" label if not opting to wear a headscarf.  It seemed to me that they equated the headscarf with purity.   Conforming to create ""unity"" is a central component to the Muslim faith. They pray in unity, facing the same direction while praying & fasting.  They don't pray the closet like many Christians.   As a westerner I would find it oppressive. But if a woman is choosing of free will - I respect it. If I can wear daisy dukes, or ride a bike naked, I surely can respect a headscarf on Muslim!"

"Thank you - the figures he cited are not documented and what he said is pure, unadulterated fiction.
Two facts:
- the few US bishops on the board will be retired and replaced by Francis within a few years
- newly chosen bishops will not be EWTN supporters
- EWTN was acquired - this alleged figures make no distinctions; does not distinguish between owner and subsidiary, etc.

Key - ""....it was precisely Mother’s “enemies within the Church” who had gained the victory by driving her from her position of control over EWTN, leaving the network entirely in the hands of lay people, many of them ex-Protestants, who did not have her traditional pre-Vatican II spiritual formation and old-fashioned Catholic militancy.""

"Still a yawn. It's interesting that someone has to point that out each time the subject even surfaces, which just sounds so anxious. It's interesting, as Erica notes so well, that it is important to some people that it is clear to one and all that women would be doing the same work but not necessarily doing it with the visible support of special graces. How can that be a good thing?"
"Demanding a comedian put on the face of tragedy and speak in solemn phrases of pop psych jargon is likely to get more laughs from the very people who were Ms Fey's target in the first place.

Please note, Josey Ross, Tina Fey was not seriously advocating sheetcake eating as a social policy. It's a metaphor for how we got here. Honestly, how many Bernie supporters voted for Trump or simply sat at home eating cake last November?

Josey Ross describes herself:  ""As a queer cisgender white woman I aim to work from a place that understands my positionality and uses my sites of privilege in solidarity with others. I use a strengths-based, trauma-informed, intersectional feminist lens grounded in anti-oppression principles.""

When one talks in jargon and technobabble, the rest of the world tunes out. Tina Fey will be listened to because she speaks in plain English. She skewered the Unite the Right nuts. She also took a jab at those hand-wringing progressives who think being smug is enough."

The elites in these countries think that it is normal to use and abuse the average person.  Many in the 3rd world are conditioned to think they are ""less"" that the elites.  If you are American and have not traveled, you cannot fathom the difference between here and there."

"This is not about honesty.  It is the G&M's campaign to have the laws and processes governing sexual assault complaints by women changed to ensure that every woman who complains will see their 'suspect' charged, tried (sort of) and ultimately convicted, regardless of the merits of the complaint. There is no compromise, nor is their any true objectivity in the campaign.  We have to remember that the good folks at the G&M are higher purpose people, and know what is best for the plebeian masses."
"Not all highly-educated women are staying at home purely due to lack of child-care spaces.

There will not be enough child-care workers for the extra spaces.

If the highly-educated women all tried to enter the work force, there may not be jobs for all of them, reducing the tax revenue.

There will be leakage of daycare spaces to lower-educated, lower-earning women, unless the daycare spaces were earmarked to higher-educated women - i.e. take from the poor to give to the rich. Such a reverse-Robin-Hood policy might make economic sense, but it makes for poor social policy. Only a pure economic conservative would undertake it."

"You accuse me of what you yourself are most guilty.  Four of my five grandchildren are ""women"" of various sizes, ranging in age from three (almost) to 17.  You can't begin to conceive in your narrow-minded, stereotyped mis-perception of me how much more I value my granddaughters (and daughter, nieces, wife, mother etc.) than ANY domestic animal.

And here's where your attempted 'besmirching' rebounds right back at you.  You CANNOT logically claim to place equal value on animals' lives without arguing that to kill an animal is just as bad as killing a human.  And in turn, you CANNOT avoid arguing that to kill a human is no worse than killing an animal.

That's how the Nazis thought--quite literally.  Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering outlawed animal experimentation in 1933--threatened to place violators in concentration camps.  Besides, he had plenty of Gypsies and Jews on which to experiment.

You see?  You're known by the company you keep--even ideologically.  And emotionally.  Khalas."

An assault victim doesn’t play in the closet of a crowded room, does not refuse the advice of friends to leave and their offer to take her, does not voluntarily spend the night in the athletes apartment, the sleep with another black athlete voluntarily in the morning.

You can’t deal with voluntary sexuality that doesn’t fit your white middle class Puritan background.

I have no problem at all with you saying group sex is wrong.  You can stop the hundreds of white couples swapping partners in Eugene and having affairs outside of marriage.

Dan Sulivan is a Marine, and I dare say he has heard locker room banter and has probably participated in it. But political correctness now has him having to suck up to President Trump. So now he is good with anyone appointed. So really only 1 person here is good with Sarah in a leadership position."

"Insurance has always been expensive it has nothing to do with Obamacare. If you think premiums are high with ObamaCare, just wait. As a healthy person those $250. -low deductible premiums- by the way based on my income- for me personally will go to about $800 without Obamacare and I have no health issues. That pricing is along with what I paid in 2010 before the Affordable Care Act. That was through United Healthcare. The unraveling of America- has begun under the head swamp creature. You will see an increase in childhood diseases, you will see HIV begin to spread again- we already have a horrible record of women dying in childbirth- as compared to third world countries. The one thing it may force people to do though is to become healthier themselves get rid of that soda- getting rid of all the fattening foods that they get through eating fast food. Perhaps everything that Trump attempts to tear apart will windup just the opposite. One can dream can't I?"

"Drummond claims the oil companies have, ""broken promises of increased oil production."" So please Ms Drummond, do you expect increased production while oil fetches ~$30 per barrel?

If he does, but keeps to all his other positions, his fans in our book are unwise, confused and engaged in wishful thinking but may be pure of heart. If he won’t denounce birtherism and admit it was hokum, his followers cannot avoid being tagged as supporting a patently racist candidate. After all, the birther nonsense was inarguably a racist attack on the first black president, designed to delegitimize his election.

"1. Women voting for Trump doesn't dismiss his sexism. 
2. You say he speaks glibly and then in the next statement say we need to judge him based on his statements. Do you see the contradiction?
3. You say you need to look past the person and focus on his actions, then you say you respect the person. I don't follow.
4. I'm sure there are women Trump values, but the ones he doesn't are degraded based on their gender. That's what makes him sexist.
5. You're assuming people are looking for reasons to hate Trump, or that it's a liberal conspiracy to smear him. My differences are based direct statements from him, and since becoming POTUS things he's done. 

He's as misguided about women as he is about many things. I do not see him as ""pure evil"" or wholly incompetent. I do take him at face value, and I don't like what I see.

"In refusing to answer this troubled woman's question which she asked in English about a lack of English language services for the mentally ill, Trudeau reminded me of three things:

1/ In combination with so many of his past remarks on the superiority of French Canadians, this suggests our cute-as-a-button PM may be a closet racist with contempt for L' Anglais.

2/ This talking to ordinary Canadians tour is really about campaigning not about listening and helping..  If Trudeau wanted to actually communicate with and be helpful to the English woman who asked in English the question about more access in Sherbrooke to English language mental health services, he obviously would have responded in English.  But his real purpose is to campaign and his remarks and replies are for mass consumption not for actual help to real people.

Airbnb has introduced a 'wild west' element which exacerbates an already unhealthy market. I've forgotten the woman's name, but she's an urban economist at Ryerson, and her study for 2015/16 demonstrated that Airbnb consumed 13% of the rental stock in downtown Toronto. Remove 13% of supply from a market. What's the result?"

"I found Kieran's overview very helpful too...my concern for kids safety in the undeveloped world was thoroughly challenged by Kieran's citation of the number of orphanages that still exist in such areas....we know that orphanages in Ireland, Canada, the US et al were locations of great abuse!


Kieren:
""The incidence of abuse in Australia has dropped significantly over the last 30 years, but then many of the systemic features that provided opportunities for abuse have declined or disappeared: the fall in the number of priests and religious; Catholic schools now staffed almost exclusively by lay people; the collapse of the altar boy system; and the church's withdrawal from boarding schools and orphanages. That is not the case overseas. The church still runs 9,492 orphanages throughout the world, most of them in underdeveloped countries."""

Her Benghazi conduct demonstrates that she is unfit to be commander-in-chief of US armed forces, punctuated by the loud exclamation point of ""What does it matter"".  Her handling of secret and confidential documents as Secretary of State of the US government show that she is unfit to have access to our nations top defense secrets.  Her willingness to manipulate the wheels of justice, demonstrated by hubby Bill's runway meeting with the Attorney General of the US...who knows what was really discussed.  Was it the FBI investigation?  Her campaign's attempt to manipulate the FBI investigation with pressure is another of her demonstrations of unfitness.  All these women coming out of the woodwork at the 11th hour of the campaign is still another question mark.  Is there anything she won't do to get elected?"
"""Democrats are not going to push hard to hold the president responsible until they are sure they have enough Republican votes to do it successfully.""

So the reason the president is not going to be held responsible for doing the really bad stuff he must of done (he is a really bad guy) is because there are not enough votes from  Republicans(really bad people) to hold him accountable for the stuff he did (it was really bad).

I doubt that narrative will sell well going in the midterms. Not in an environment where reason and logic has been weaponized by .... cough ... cough... the Russians.   Or maybe it was that green frog and his sister fefe."
They hate the patriarchy and want you to believe they are being widely oppressed the world over. This of course is entirely the fault of Trump and nothing else. All women the world over want elite power and status. The Sword of Damocles would look good on them.

So you think Trump is bad for his disrespect of women but you insult Betty as a cave person based on her name?  Don't say it was because of her opinion.  You deliberately used her name as an insult.  Ironic.
"Hi Alexandra,

It is true that many rich people did vote for Trump (at least they will get something for themselves out of that choice).

However, the majority of people who voted for Trump were people who were working class, underpaid & angry that the established party people were ignoring their plight.  Then there were the conservatives & pro-life Christians who were advised by their churches to support any candidate no matter how terrible who would go after Roe v. Wade & all clinic funding regardless if the clinic's funding was not going to abortion in any way.  Our conservative nuns fit into this second category.  

We need to hold laity, all religious, and clergy accountable for not demanding genuine justice for women in our church & for cooperating outside our church with making oppressive laws.

Network does not support women priests so we need to let nuns know too if they want our support, they need to get real on equality too, despite the risk.  Sexism causes poverty globally."
"The Clinton's are notorious liars. Remember Bill claiming, 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman (Monica)?  Monica is not supporting Hillary. She said the last Clinton in the White House left a bad taste in her mouth."

"When the inquiry collapses the native women and chiefs will demand Ottawa give them  the money left over from the budget of $53 million, because they consider it theirs.

"Respectfully to Ms. Jennings re: ""Obamacare""/ACA which Trump  will throw out and Clinton will keep and improve. As young women you  have not faced serious medical issues but in time you, or your spouse/partner or children WILL and without ACA these will become ""pre-existing conditions"" that will preclude you from getting health care unless you are consistently employed in a job that offers health care and overlooks ""pre-existing"". It's heartbreaking to not be able to get proper medical care for yourself or your family or if such care depletes your savings and plunges you into ""medical bankruptcy"".
And it's not just about ""us""... Catholic social teaching calls for concern for the poor, but the anti-ACA forces (primarily Republican) who refuse to expand Medicaid leave thousands of low-income, single millenials unable to afford insurance and get needed medical care. I urge you to become educated about what the refusal to expand Medicaid has done to so many low-income, childless millenials"
"For an ""exited"" Catholic like myself, the choice of Mrs. Gingrich is merely another affirmation, in a vast series of affirmations, that the Church is not for me."
"I know several girls that hated the Journeys curriculum that GS rolled out a few years ago, and their involvement with the organization quickly declined. Why force the girls away from the badges they liked? I know they've now rolled out badges within the Journeys, but it's not the same. By trying to make one program work for everybody, it ended up not satisfying anyone."
"""[Kim Stanton says:] Unfortunately for many women, Trump is now linked inextricably with misogyny.""

What does she mean ""unfortunately""? This inextricable linkage is exactly what lefties have been trying to CREATE by creating a flood of quotes like that.

Then bemoan it, while secretly rubbing hands together and thinking ""we've got him now!!"".  Except they don't."

"I'm always amazed how deeply the sides are dug in on this issue... 

The Pro-Choice says that every woman should be able to abort her child (fetus) up until the hour before it is naturally born. 
Even at 8.5 months women should have the right to abort it. 

The Pro-life says that sex is where a baby starts. And anything afterwards is murder.

Nobody will budge. 

Right now the Pro-choice has exactly what they want in Canada... so is a memoir really necessary? On-demand abortion during anytime in the pregnancy is fully legal in Canada. (Ya true...good luck getting a doctor to abort a baby a week away from giving birth...but it's totally legal)"

So how does this work: government offers unsolicited screening to all women to enable (encourage?) the most violent reaction a woman can have towards her pregnancy and unborn child: death by abortion. But somehow this unspoken negative message is accompanied with positive words that life with Down syndrome can be rewarding too? Is that even possible? Not only government and many medical professionals are contributing to a eugenics framework but so is everyone who claims that abortion for the sole reason of Down syndrome is a 'choice' and not a sign of inequality and violence towards the population with Down syndrome. The Global Down Syndrome Foundation is not doing us a favor. They should condemn the practice of selective abortion. Period. No amount of information will take away the negative message that screening to enable abortion brings.

"As I said, I find both Trump and Clinton unpalatable. I supported Bernie Sanders in the primary, because his views are sympathetic to me. However, Trump actively frightens me, and I loathe what he stands for as well. I can see Trump getting into a war through ignorance and personal pique. I do not see Clinton doing that.

Most of all, Trump actually repudiates Christianity. He embraces racism. He sees women as sex objects -- he said that one of the women who accused him of groping was ""too ugly"" for him to consider doing that. This is apparently a serious response to the accusation. He does not stand for any sort of moral values.

I question the values of the so-called Christian leaders who support Trump. They are actually hurting their own churches. After this election, in which so many Christians in the US have behaved so very badly, who would ever want to darken the door of one of their churches again?"

Cudos to you Gary for almost thinking beyond knee jerk reactionary anti-Trump blather.  A very good question.  I recommend you start your inquiry into how many females voted for president Trump and then go from there.
"Honestly … Despite more than 100 years of moving toward gender equality – women gaining the right to vote, to hold political office, to attend university, to own property, affirmative action programs – women still experience a ""tsunami of patriarchy and misogyny"" that prevents them from achieve their full potential.  

This is nothing more than full-on propaganda.

A few other points: (1) No matter how much you research, with expert help (financial planners and tax people and so on), you'll still encounter surprises. On the plus side, we now get U.K. pensions (albeit small ones) because my wife worked several years in the U.K. On the negative side, her CPP is much smaller than any financial planner predicted. Turns out she needed to work 40 full years in Canada. (2) A good idea is: Work in a high-income place; retire in a low-cost place."

In 1900, 1 person in 5 in the empire was a slave, and you could still buy female slaves on the streets of Constantinople right up to before the war started.

"London, Coventry and other UK cities were never Battlefields in WW2, but that didn't stop the Nazis from dropping bombs on non combatants, including women and children. 

The Nazi Armed Forces used a number of means of killing Jews and others. Poison Gas was just one of the weapons they used. Other weapons included firearms and vehicle exhaust. A weapon is something used to kill. Nobody would try to use a captive bolt gun in battle, but it is still a weapon used to kill cows and other livestock.

Do you claim that the firearms, including automatic weapons, used to kill Jews and others were not weapons because they were not being used on a battlefield at the time?"
"A reference to cellulite I am sure.  Point is, abortion was not only allowed, it was mandated if adultery was suspected.  Joseph was actually within his rights to disown Mary publicly, make her drink the bitter waters to abort the Christ and have her stoned. He did not do so, but it was within is rights under the law. Jesus did not abolish the law until he destroyed the temple in three days, but he echoed that act of mercy given to him in his dealings with the woman caught in adultery.  People assume they pulled her out of bed, but she may have just been pregnant.  Like fighting Eugenics from the Papal Throne, there is a huge difference between stopping mandatory abortion and criminalizing it."

"Go by what I SAY, Phil, not what YOU think I imply,  which is YOUR inference. In other words, don't put words in my mouth. As for felons, I think they should legally vote. They are already punished with incarceration, which is loss of freedom. I believe they would have more respect for society if they owned a part of it. Taking away the voting franchise is a stupid thing our society does.

Last election a Texas woman was arrested and deported for voting. She had lived in Texas all her life but wan't a US citizen. She said she thought she could legally vote. From my point of view her one vote was meaningless, just as my one vote is meaningless. As long as money is speech, as the SC ruled and as Congress has accepted, then the individual vote is insignificant compared to the big money spent by wealthy people (corporations are people, by law) which distorts our elections.

Illegal presence in the US is a misdemeanor for a first conviction. Many who cross the border are simply turned back."

Quite right, Mary O'Malley. The KKK targeted Catholics (spelled with a ""K""), African Americans and Jews. (I won't publish the repulsive ""K"" names for the latter two targeted  groups.) Shame on our Catholic leadership. Symbols of bigotry count! They are almost as timid as English Catholic bishops who fear protesting against the burning of an effigy of the pope on Guy Fawkes Day in England. The latter (as do all religious and political leaders there) simply look the other way, believing in time, people will come to their senses."

"""but we don't spend a lot of time concerned about gay weddings""
That's why you and other conservative Christians are busy defending bakers and others who use their Christian beliefs to deny goods and services to gay couples in defiance of the law.
As far as I'm concerned, the Dark Ages were followed by the Renaissance and the Enlightenment. Secular movements.
You overlook that Mr. Bonora said ""the rest of us"". That is, the people who are not conservative Christians.
Conservative Christians want to reimpose their moral code on the rest of us. They want abortion banned despite the fact no woman has to undergo one involuntarily, they want to be able to show their moral superiority over gay couples by refusing them goods and services, they denounce the teaching of evolution because it's not biblical, and they want store clerks to be able to refuse to sell women contraception in order to condemn such women.
Your side can't stand the fact that the USA is a diverse secular country."

Your head is so far in the bubble that you can't see which political party is restricting our freedoms; so-called conservative ideology.  Liberals aren't the party obsessed with passing laws to restrict women's healthcare, or place restrictions on educating the nation's children.  Oh no, Mr. Wood.  Can't blame the liberals for what the Republicans are doing to this country.  The nation's Constitution isn't about ""restricting government,"" it's about protecting the people's liberties.

Yes Bear-spray does work.  It is better than most guns at extremely close range.  As a poster mentioned above a bear can move very fast & will overtake any human in a matter of feet.

The reason for the demand for written communication by Vatican bureaucrats is their way of killing with a thousand tiny cuts this already weak papal initiative to address the rape and sodomy of children by priests and bishops: classic Vatican clerical infighting with a stiletto between the ribs.  

And, this strategy by the ""lepers of the church"" is working:  Marie Collins is no longer on the commission.

"I am disappointed that G&M neglected to even consider all those authors who are publishing without spending thousands on a company, and those who are not having to deal with paying for an entire print run, as is suggested. There are thousands who are self-publishing and are full-time authors, and who sell primarily ebooks, and not just American authors.

"Good points. I see Lintymint showed everyone he learned how to use google as if an isolated incident in Japan over twenty years ago has parallels to the current European scourge of Islamist extremism. There are 20,000 + known Islamist extremists in the UK and more ISIS fighters return to Europe on a daily basis and European leaders respond with political impotence and hoping for the best. It's only a function of dumb luck that there haven't been more attacks with authorities over-stretched and governments afraid to address issues staring everyone in the face #becauseit's2017.

"""...indigenous women make up a disproportionate number of street sex workers in places like Vancouver and Edmonton.""

Here's what I found: 
“Based on our study, many of the people linked to Canada’s sex industry—workers and their intimate partners, managers and clients—have much in common with other Canadians. By and large, they are Canadian-born, Caucasian, in their 30s or 40s with a high school diploma and some form of post-secondary education or training,” the report states.  (Georgia Straight, Sept 19 2014)

The report: ""The working paper, whose lead author is Cecilia Benoit of the University of Victoria, will be discussed at an international symposium in Ottawa on September 22 and 23. It’s based on five studies undertaken in St. John’s, Montréal, Kitchener, Fort McMurray, Calgary, and Victoria."""

What possible use can there be in allowing her to suck any more precious oxygen from the already toxic atmosphere that is Dumberikkka? If she will not go on her own she should be put to pasture."

Likewise:  no one will answer the questions I want answered:  If abortion were illegal, what would you do to the woman, doctor, nurse, mid-wife, medical equipment suppliers, drug suppliers when a woman has an abortion?

And in any case, it is because of non-payment of accounts and neither is it a total cut -off. 
Then these ladies say action on climate change should be about reducing poverty, inequality and advancing participative democracy... into apartheid legacy etc, etc. Clearly mixed up ! 
I incidentally live on a small plot and  try to manage water use from both a consumption and cost viewpoint, We do have a covered above ground pool with limited use going forward.

Straight from the Communist Party USA head, John Bachtell:
http://www.peoplesworld.org/article/the-2016-elections-are-strategic-for-advancing-racial-justice/

""This election will be a national referendum on racism, misogyny, homophobia, xenophobia and Islamophobia. The aim should be a landslide defeat of Trump and a decisive rejection of hate. The election of Clinton as the first woman president would make history. A landslide would not end sexism, but it would represent a mighty blow just as the election of President Obama was a blow against racism. It would advance democracy.""

If that's not support for Clinton, what would you call it?  You can wipe that smug look off your face - you're flat out wrong and busted."
"Let's go down that list:

Orlando - the shooter was an American citizen born in New York
San Bernadino - the shooter was also an American citizen born in Chicago.  His wife was born in Pakistan and grew up in Saudi Arabia (neither country is affected by the ban)
Boston Marathon - both brothers were US citizens and had immigrated to the US over ten years before from places that are not on the banned list
Chattanooga - the shooter was a US citizen who had lived in the country for 20 years when he went on a rampage - again not from any of the countries on the banned list

As for honour killings, while we rarely hear about them if not perpetrated by Muslims, they are hardly unique to followers of that religion.  But no idea why you would include that here - after all, the travel ban has nothing to do with that."
"It was encouraging to hear Francis refer to Babette's Feast. Babette Hersant is an artist, a magician--some even think her a witch--but ultimately a Christ figure who orchestrates and presides over this feast for 12. In every way, she eclipses the usual roles for women envisioned by the Church. This is a good sign!"

"Tridentinus, I am talking about the Fundamentalist, power seeking Catholics who use politics to legislate and force their primitive, intrusive, domineering doctrines on  modern Catholics,  non-Catholics, and non-believers. Catholic supported Hospitals who refuse to give women those reproductive health treatments banned by fundamentalist Catholics, pharmacies who refuse to sell contraceptives to women, are also guilty of practicing their so-called religious beliefs on other people. That is also discriminating against non-Fundamentalist Catholics. Modern Catholics support all those treatments, procedures and devices that Fundamentalists are against. Do you know your Medieval History?  Millions of innocent people  were tortured and killed by  Roman Orthodox Fundamentalist Christians who used the power given them by the Roman Emperors,  to subjugate, torture and kill people including Christians who did not accept their dogmas."

Medics found the woman had no major injuries and she remained at the scene to speak with the police.

I'm glad that this issue is being recognized and steps are being taken to help Marshallese women understand the full extent of what they're doing but there comes a time when people have to be responsible for their own actions. It's up to the individual to educate themselves and protect their interests.  Ignorance is not bliss nor is it an excuse. I'd hope these Marshallese women are at least aware that there are cultural differences around the world. Or is that asking too much?
"Good for you Hugh for making this point.  Looking back at 150 years ago, it's hard for us moderns to comprehend that slavery was the biggest issue of the day by far, and Americans were split on it...that it divided Americans from the beginning..... that it  often crushed the bodies and minds of its victims...... that young women were raped to produce more slaves....and it took a war  with over 600,000 deaths to finally end it.
AND what it meant that Mathew  P.  Deady was considered  Oregon's strongest slavery advocate......and that had he prevailed, Oregon could have ended up on the side of the South with destructive internal Civil War, much like Missouri.   Thank God Deady's position  was overwhelmingly rejected by the voters.

AND yet-- in  his later judicial decisions he was often protective of minority rights, especially Chinese, and in his personal life he showed no racism, with both of his bailiffs being blacks, and of course he did so much for Oregon and the UO....

Third statement - most economists have analyzed her proposed tax plan and concede that it would raise debt by an estimated $200 billion annually.  Compare that to Trump's $20 trillion over 20 years.  You also leave out that ultimately any proposal has to go through congress and we never really know about tax income year in and year out.

"No tears from 40,000,000 Syeds (progeny of Mohammed) today over this icon of anti-Mohammedan, anti-Koranic Kaliphate.

Between 2 Abubakrs (the first Kaliph and last) Kaliphate was a drag on civilization curtailing trade and human progress for 1,400 years no less.

Socrates was done in by big business and banker Demos. 1000 years later Mohammed, allied with Christians to rout his Meccan Demos, ushering a new era of peace, justice, women's emancipation, free entreprise, and free trade.

But upon his death the neocon moneyed Demos hijacked his progressive revolution morphing it into Kaliphate of gore, glory, conquest, and colonialism, picking needless fight with Christians, imposing Tariffs (Arabic word) on East-West trade, finally blocking it altogether thus starving Christian Europe into half, and forcing them to find new routes to Asia and new lands.

Let us bury the Kaliphate and its symbols forever. Divine Hand bombed this one; is Mosque of Umar, the second Kaliph next, god willing."

She lives and works in Seattle, where she is employed by Delta Dental, an ""insurance company"" that sells fluoride, usually by providing the equipment to meter it into community water systems ""free"", on the condition that if said community terminates fluoridation before ten years are up, the people of the affected city will be charged for that equipment. Fluoride is highly corrosive though, and who is responsible for costs of repair and replacement of that equipment after ten years is unclear. What is clear is that Mrs. Firman and her employer have a financial interest in fluoridation that should give all affected citizens reason to question her opinions as unbiased. She and her employer are profiting handsomely from fluoridation."

Alas the poor women is hugely obese and I imagine if someone lets their health degenerate like that their political thinking is going in the same way. 

So, it is up to each and everyone of you to have a chat with this type and point out that their voting behavior was just above the status of child molester after what they have now done to the country. A Toronto Sun front page cartoon had a good position on the provincial Liberals that is now adaptable to the federal ones - throw the bums out!"

A woman who told me she brings her grandkids every so often said that part was accessible years ago, but park officials were worried about people ""seeing"" too much of it. Maybe more needs to be limited. That wouldn't bother me. We will never have anything like this again in the U.S. Never.

"Agree on HRC and the DNC. For a smart woman, she made a lot of dumb mistakes, including surrounding herself with people who had an amazing lack of foresight.

Also agree that the 'just war' questions around cyber-warfare are important. Historically, whenever technology advances faster than the ability to understand the moral implications of it, major problems arise. This is an urgent conversation and it's just begun.

Rabbit hole or not, the Trump/Russia thing fascinates me. Nixon taught us that the cover-up can be worse than the original crime, but with Trump there may be a whole new twist. He may well be covering up something that wasn't a crime in the first place, just for the sake of protecting the illusion that he won an electoral mandate. Incredible."

"Obviously, it's possible (and I would argue 'necessary') to evaluate the things people say or do separately from whatever someone else might be saying/doing. 

Trump's comments and (alleged) actions are, independently from whatever the Clintons have done, reprehensible and potentially criminal. Any alleged crimes of the Clintons are completely irrelevant in regards to this. The Clintons' misdeeds don't 'justify' Trump's deeds, nor do they make Trump's comments and actions any less 'wrong' or (potentially) 'criminal'. Two wrongs don't make a right!

What Trump's accusers are claiming matches Trump's own words. And it matches a documented history of how Trump objectifies and demeans women. Therefore, I don't find their claims suspicious. Whether they are true or false remains to be seen, but to argue that these women are, by default, 'liars' or 'financial prostitutes' isn't based on proven facts, but on an emotionally biased opinion to defend Trump at all costs."

"As a senior citizen and a feminist who has marched a few times in life, I disagree with all this 'tomorrow' marching. The marching should have been done before the US election. Where were all the Americans then- the 142 million who chose not to vote at all? This protest will do little to change the future of the US under Trump. He is a dangerous person and he will just stick to his position in, and no doubt be vindictive to those who have been against him. Not once did he say Thank You publicly to the Obamas; not once did he thank Melania, who must be a strong women while raising Baron; not once did Trump show any humility.

If you did not accept that Jesus was a transvestite, you would be dispensing with the magisterium, right? I don't think you understand that the teaching authority of the church cannot contradict prior teachings. Very poor catechesis, very very bad. Vatican 2 contradicted prior teachings of the church, it just made stuff up to suite the fads of the time.

"Classical liberalism was about free thought.  

Modern liberalism seeks to restrict freedom.  They are all about freedom, except when it comes to guns, school choice, freedom of expression, health care, freedom of religion, taxes, etc.  They want women to have ""access"" to contraception and abortion, yet if the same women have cancer, they don't want them to have ""access"" to potential life saving drugs if those drugs are experimental.  Please, sir, don't tell me liberalism is about free thought or freedom.  Liberalism is about control. The funny thing is--guns are explicitly mentioned in the Constitution as a right, while abortion, health care, pot, etc are not mentioned!

One of Jones's most important books is ""Libido Dominandi,"" which details how people like Soros who seek to subvert the Catholic Church, start out by degrading the sexual mores, targeting, first, young women.  Once young women are persuaded to think of themselves as sexual objects, and to think it is fine to do so, it is a simple matter to take over the rest of the culture.  Reducing women to degraded sexualized objects is an instrument of control and domination, in which the dominated participate in their own domination.

Some of the doctrines you preach in your private catechism are rather different from orthodox Christian doctrine.  Why preach them at all if the difference does not matter?  But as I see it breakaway sects are always boasting their institutions over the Church.  An oppositional posture and oppositional way of defining themselves drips from their literature, their websites, and (often) in person.  SSPX is like this.  You may not see it because it's like water to a fish.  But every bit of it is the boasting of one institution over another.

"I agree Kevin. No one ever wants to compromise, but we could make strides. Unfortunately, pro life groups often give false information, like saying Hillary is for partial birth abortion, which has already been banned. Ninth month abortion is non existent according to most Doctors that I have read. President Bush signed restrictions in 2007, and there are many restrictions already in 44 States. We can make more progress though. If you look at Europe they have a smaller window for abortion, and more help and support for women to have their children.

"Diplomacy without a credible threat of force is of little use in dealing with the DPRK, which is determined to make itself a nuclear power.

They are not gathering weapons in order to trade them away, but rather as a means to security.  The Kim dynasty is paranoid but not stupid, and its longtime grip on power shows there is a logic to its actions.

If the US has decided not to allow a missile threat to the homeland, a limited strike would not be wise.  The North would surely retaliate, perhaps by attacking Japanese bases as a way of stirring up Korean nationalism.  Then what?

Iran, another threshold nuclear power, is watching carefully.  One possible approach would be to start a serious military buildup.  This would concentrate the minds of the Chinese and put the ball in the Northern court.  But of course the whole situation  is very dangerous."

Further, not a single bishop, to my knowledge, spoke directly to the Access Hollywood tapes or the subsequent instances of sexual abuse. Where was the outrage from them? My daughter and many of her generation have left the Catholic church because they don't think the hierarchy has any ability, or even any desire, to understand how the world looks from a woman's perspective.

The problem is that there is so much misinformation about the public service pension plan that reasonable discussion simply is not possible.

"America is by far the wealthiest nation on the planet, and the richest in history, but conservatives declare that we cannot afford single payer. 

We can afford to send cruise missiles into an inconsequential Syrian airfield, a $1 million/year marine to Afghanistan, but when it comes to already born babies and pregnant women, oh you're just a taker who doesn't deserve my precious cash!

When foreign death is more valuable than domestic health, our nation dies bit by bit, but hey! We still have our guns, freedom yeah!"
"In the United States, the term ""white supremacy"" is historically associated with the period of Jim Crow laws, the last of which were removed in the 1960s.

Racism is an ism--that is, a set of beliefs, norms, or group practices that can be given a coherent abstract definition and description in detail.  The Nazis, KKK, and most of the alt-right rabble are indeed racists, because they assert such beliefs, and it is possible to describe systematically what they will say and do.  The old lady down the block who still refers to black Americans as ""colored"" isn't ""racist""--even if she admits personal distaste toward blacks.  A personal preference is not an ism."

"Years ago I came to the conclusion that the pro-life movement was more about being anti-women than truly caring about the unborn.  That is when I started to view social justice in an entirely new light.  Yup, I am a pro-choice/pro-lifer.  Abortion is merely a symptom of greater societal and global problems.  Taking away a woman's right to choose will not change the problems that bring women to choose abortion.  If pro-life really wants to end abortion, start ""curing"" the societal ills.  So much of what I hear coming from the radical pro-life groups is closed heart and hateful rhetoric.  The bible isn't their personal bully weapon.  My advice to them, if they truly do care...open your heart and your mind will follow."
"I just want to point out that the people of Louisiana had the option to vote for a white supremacist (David Duke)  for the senate this year, and only 3% did so, while 58% voted for Trump.  That's the same percentage that voted for noted racist Angela Kaaihue here.  I grew up there in the 80's and 90's, and its not like you remember.  It's still far more segregated than Hawaii and there is a widespread mutual distrust between races in a general sense, but individuals do tend to give individuals of the other race a fair chance.  I think the Democratic Party's methods of preaching victimhood is far more damaging to the South's blacks than the Republican party or any white supremacist remnants.  BTW, I've never received any negative comments or noticed any funny looks when I go back home with my Asian wife.  I do admire your stand for what is right against your father and community in a time when that must have been very hard."
"Over the years, I've come to believe that radicals have a personality type, and regardless of circumstance will find a cause that they can get indignant and righteous about.  This is why you see so many of the same faces at public demonstrations (some of these are people I know) regardless of the issue.  These women totally fit this category.

The more extreme of these types of people can become violent, and lean to terrorism. 

In any event, were they ever in charge after successfully achieving their 'activist' aims, they will likely be tyrants.  I personally wouldn't bother giving these people air time. ."
"first I'd say conservative Christians are neither truly conservative (those who are truly conservative are known as Liberals) nor Christian, if they call themselves religious and voted for Trump they mostly did so because they typically vote republican and / or blindly hate Hillary.

while abortion voters are simply lumped into the 'dedicated to ignorance' and war on women's rights collective, who typically react emotionally instead of with the readily available facts."
Spent 7 years in Winnipeg. Lived in one of the nice neighbourhoods but most of the city is a filthy mess.
"Yes, Catholic history has ample numbers of female saints who might/might not be considered a Wonder Woman for their time. They offer examples to be emulated. But they do not offer leadership for our times.

Leadership requires an active woman of today. A Christian Wonder Woman is one who has the necessary qualities -- and the qualifications.

In the Catholic Christian arena full ordination completes the qualifications requirement. Anything less than full ordination is an institutional decision that a Catholic Wonder Woman cannot exist, and/or is not wanted, and/or is thought to be of no benefit to the church as an institution or to church members personally."
"I understand all that about the whole playing the children card, if it was EVER important to prohibitionists to protect children they would have never have lied to us as children telling us something that the body itself produces (speaking of the Endocannabinoid system) is dangerous whilst plying the bulk of society with other licit and illicit substances that cause far more harm than Cannabis could EVER harm even a small baby who already has the same chemical composition as the plant in it's mother's milk. Prohibition always served it's purpose to glamorize a relatively safe substance and thereby enticing the uninitiated to experiment until a personal truth is discovered. similiar to many rites of passage in almost every culture extant."
"How do you define ""hate""? The rational, measured statements that the exclusion and diminution of women is a direct consequence of a sustained, perverse, derogatory definition of women is not hate. However, the exclusion and diminution of women based upon a sustained, perverse, derogaroty definition of women, her origin, her purpose contrary to reason IS misogyny, a hatred with and/or without emotion."
"As a woman, I don't want to be told who I am, and I don't want anyone telling my daughter either."
"Outsider, I agree that people should be treated with decency. We should be kind, or at least be respectful to each other. But in two days you have blamed a stalking victim for being stalked, and a murder victim for being murdered. It sounds like you, or someone you care about, has a bad female ex. There are a lot of bad exes out there, of both genders.  But PC-ness is irrelevant. There is nothing the girlfriend could have said or done that would mitigate her murder. Interpersonal violence is the fault of the perpetrator."
"I have always been pro-choice.  That being said, I do not believe abortions are a method of birth control.  A woman with a medical issue will weigh her options and do serious soul searching before making a decision, at least that is what I hope would happen. As far as rape is concerned I think the option of the morning after pill is a better solution and should be readily available to everyone."
Look to the mother. If she is obese then there is a good probability that her daughter will be too.

"For a start, I don't want my daughter thinking it's OK that, according to one of our major world religions, females should be rendered invisible, untouchable, unapproachable human beings, who's faces and eyes cannot be seen, and that this dictat applies only to females, and that our society thinks this is OK. Not acceptable, as far as I am concerned."
"Uma's (sp?) husband started the 2nd look at emails because of his ""special"" emails to women."
"Women have won civil rights/equality battles much more recently - including the right to play sports as recently as the 70s. And your comment on dates doesn't reverse my point. My point stands - domestic demonstrations absolutely have a lot to do with protecting actual freedoms in the US. 

The problem might lay with you, and the freedoms you consider disposable and a contempt for women's rights. People were protesting not because their side lost, but because of the freedoms that might get lost due to that election. They had every right to be concerned about losing their rights under a right wing govt with p$$y grabbing president. 

I'm sorry if you're unable to understand that concept."
"A bitter bytchy column,  one woman slagging another for her success, while advocating that more women ought to be more successful. Personally I don't' like Ms Trump  all that much (cold, calculating, distant towards Barron). but she  is a role model to millions of women who will be far more comfortable in life than the ones who follow Tabatha's ohilosy."
I'm so worried that HRC will take the state that sometimes at night I cry like a little girl.
But she does seem to be enjoying herself.
"People are scared of black people because black people can be violent & they will probably beat you up if you annoy them. So I have rarely seen whites or Asians being openly, verbally racist to black people. 

But I did hear my white female high school classmate say something nasty to a black girl who was a nice, polite, friendly girl, not the type of girl who would beat you up.

I have seen white & black people harass, bully & saying racist things to Asians or saying racist things about Asians.

I have seen Asians being nasty to Asians, Asians saying nasty things to Asians, Asians saying nasty things about Asians.

Asians are easy targets for racists & bullies because Asians are less likely to beat you up or talk back to you if you harass them.

Most likely, you will see acts of racism against Asians & Muslim looking people.

Blacks face discrimination & prejudice in school, looking for job, looking to rent a home.

There have been news reports of racist white people attacking blacks."
"The article certainly has more information than when I commented earlier.  
Looking under women's skirts with a mirror, how icky is that?"
"Outsider77: He's a generic definition of ""sexual assault"". Sexual assault is a sexual act in which a person is coerced or physically forced to engage against their will, or a non-consensual sexual touching of a person. Sexual assault is a form of sexual violence, and it includes rape (such as forced vaginal, anal or oral penetration or drug facilitated sexual assault), groping, forced kissing,[citation needed] child sexual abuse, or the torture of the person in a sexual manner.[1][2][3]

  You seem to imply that anything short of rape really isn't sexual assault.  Few jurisdictions...none that I know of..share your perspective.  You refer to women who take grevious offense at unwanted touching (groping) as whinners and suggest such groping is ""inconsequential.""  You really seem to suggest that women should just be ""better sports"" about receiving unwanted sexual advances (short of rape, of course) and not get so (to use your phrase) ""pissed off"" about it.  Wow....."
"I can't think of a time when prostitution was a ""non-event."" It has certainly been forbidden in most of America throughout the nation's entire history. (I said forbidden, not non-existent.) If you're concerned about sexual assault, and we all should be, then we need to address that behavior appropriately. (A good start would be giving more than 6 months in jail to an athlete who rapes a woman.) We should not abandon solid principles of morality, we should not abandon the families hurt by prostitution, in an attempt to address sexual assault. To do so devalues the victims of prostitution."
She knows exactly what she is doing. They all do.
"""Incorporated into Christ by Baptism, the person baptized is configured to Christ."" (CCC 1272)

Baptism configures to Christ. Once configured, one cannot become 'more configured' by another sacrament. Once pregnant, one cannot become 'more' pregnant. 

""configured to Christ the priest in such a way that they are able to act in the person of Christ the head"" (CCC 1563)

In ordination the priests is configured to act 'in persona Chrsitie', in the community gathered in prayer, because in fact it is Christ who is praying in and with the community (not the priest personally). In this sense, the 'special character' received is restrictive to specific situations and purpose. Note the contrast with the prayer of the unordained: they act/pray in their own names, as individuals configured to Christ. The 'special' dose not mean better, it means different (in this case, restricted). 

In short, there is no difference in degree of holiness. Nothing can improve on Baptism."
"I am reading 'Smart Women Finish Rich' and it talks about saving, not only the money from daily luxuries like coffee, but paying yourself 20%. My own grandmother brought her family back after her husband was not checking in. She did this is the same way; small and mean. There is nothing wrong with making changes. In theory, they might even be fun. Enough with the sour grapes. If you don't want to stay with grandma. there are many ways to do it, including.....pet sitting. But you have to like pets. What I mean to say is, enjoying life doesn't mean living paycheck to paycheck. This is where I check out."
"Sorry Margaret, the first thing to get right is you are no longer a girl but a woman, grown-up , adult  - anything but a girl.  Time to get real."
"Winning awards, including ""Book of the Year"" at the iBook Authors Conference in Nashville, no doubt has helped sales. As a Canadian self-publisher/co-author of an interactive eBook made for the iPad, I've had to break down barriers not only to have this book accepted into ebook competitions, I do so as a woman in tech over the age of 50. I will be the first to say that print is not dead. Based on my web design background, I wanted to offer readers a visually engaging interactive experience. Proudly, How to Say Cheese, delivers pure edutainment. 

The idea of entering awards came after seeing a presentation by Theresa Nicassio PhD, at a local YVR Authors Group. Theresa self-published YUM, a hardcover cookbook. She explained that winning multiple awards, including Gourmand - Best in the World, has open doors that otherwise may not have been open. She encourages authors to embrace the idea of entering competitions, but be discerning of awards that are just interested in taking your money."

"Or maybe, you can go to to work and have female friends and come home to be great fathers?"
"Staring at someone's chest is ""getting jollies"" ? What does that mean ?

I don't think anyone on the opposition side is defending this guys actions, but simply offering an option for the woman that is offended, and that is she can cover up in some way if it bothers her. We would have to, of course, see the picture to fully understand if she was dressed provocatively, which BTW is still a very relative term these days. Why is making a mere suggestion that a woman has some influence over how she dresses create such a silly firestorm in this website, you would think we suggested we take their voting rights away or something."
"Please don't give anymore attention to Sarah Long.  Ripping up another candidiates card is ridiculous- should she should be barred from meetings due to her disuptive and immature behavior.  She seems not quite right in the head.

The fact that Hart Noecker associate Jesss Sponberg attacks Bailey is just an example of the schoolyard bullying that has characetrized this race.  Sponberg lacks the cajones to take on Wheeler, so he beats up on the weaker of the two front runners."
Who is dressing up in women's clothing now?
"What about pregnancy?  The total cost for medical expenses, lost time to maternity leave, lost unit efficiency for extended absences, etc. is what total?  Pregnant women aren't deployable. Guess who takes their places? What about the disruption to unit cohesiveness during a deployment?  How many females leave the military after childbirth?  DoD revised the chapter for ""Lack of a Family Care Plan"" since it applied to single-soldiers."
"I shouldn't be forced to have to cover the missing taxes from organizations like Prevo's church that declare themselves as non-profits, but in the meantime spend lots of money fighting abortion. There are people who oppose medical services as not being the will of God either, should we bow to their wishes and not offer any medical services to anyone? As a Christian I am infuriated by other Christians who do not really understand The Lord's message and want to impose their way of life on the public."
"Can I ask, how does the ""Catholic Church invalidate [your] personhood because [you are] female"" ?"

Shame on each of you that have written a comment: a women is dead from her own hand. My condolences to her family. Please if you know someone who is showing signs of deep depression please contact the mental health in your town or the hospital. This is really a matter of lefe or death.
irrelevant - these are key constitutional powers questions not a popularity contest amongst a bunch of middle school girls.
"Not True!  In the early Church women played a prominent role in all aspects. There were women deacons and judging from Paul's writings there were women presbyters.  Over time, especially after Constantine the Church like most governing institutions became patriarchal something Jesus would question. (Please do not use the oft-cited truism of the 12 apostles which is more inline with the early Church view of Christ as the Creator of the New Israel.)"

"These unfortunate women were involved in activities that they did not want their family and friends to   know about and they subsequently lost contact with their family and friends. Though more First Nations people live off reserve, more government money goes to those who live on the reserve."
"I would have preferred that the father of Ryan Owens have been allowed to speak and demand an investigation into why that mission was allowed to continue once it was known that the team had been compromised. They walked right into an ambush. Using the widow was a cynical use of a grieving woman as a show piece designed to warn anyone from further questioning or criticizing the ill conceived and executed mission. The so called president has no shame, no morals, no sense of respect and most certainly no qualifications for leading the American military. Earlier in the day he had in fact blamed the death of Specialist Owens on the Generals. No shame."
"Statistics show that the great majority of female homicide victims are killed by current or former husbands and boyfriends, and the RCMP study concluded that this is the case for indigenous women as well as non-indigenous women - meaning that indigenous homicide victims are killed by their indigenous partners or ex-partners.
As for the women murdered by serial killers, they are almost all drug-addicted street sex workers, who have been a favourite target of serial killers since Jack the Ripper simply because they are easy prey - and sadly, indigenous women make up a disproportionate number of street sex workers in places like Vancouver and Edmonton.
Instead of spending $50 million on an inquiry which would teach us nothing new, how about finding ways to stop violence on reserves, and preventing drug and alcohol abuse among indigenous people?"
I bet your constructed just like Trump.. hope those 3 inches has gotten you far picking on women instead of facing the facts.. you are obviously a sick wind paid for staring in the mirror dipshit! Like an appy lol you just stare into the sun you friggin looser!!!
"Who says they're crazy to want continued health care, clean air and water, free access to the entire internet, guaranteed continuing Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid as well as a functioning VA, unrestricted access to women's health and reproductive care, and decent public education? Just you, I think.

Refusal by these public servants to serve and inform the public is not acceptable. They need to stand before the public and account for their perfidious plotting. If they can't represent their constituents, they need to resign."
"For this poor woman it really was ""time and again"" ....  FIVE times in a row."
She is a bigot. So are the Muslims who demand Muslim doctors. What's your point?

"Woo Hoo!  I can't stand the woman but this is the right decision.  Without going into detail (as I was actually part of a study that looked at this issue 15 years ago), the money raised would not be sufficient to cover the cost.  
I suspect this was just political wrangling on Tory's part.  If so, well played."
"Thank you Jane for expressing the idea that we survivors and supporters were shunned and discredited. The very Church that we thought would protect us, not only deserted us but actively pushed us away as if we were lepers. There were a few supporters but only in secret as they would not speak out against those who were persecuting us.  Re-victimized.

Lest I forget - Thank you Peter, again, for such a wonderful tribute to this wonderful and multi-faceted woman."
Oh I remember now - your daughter was the one applying pancake makeup while texting her parole officer.
"Exodus 35:2   Those that work the Sabbath shall be put to death.

"I can't speak for the rest of the country; I will defend your right to wear a ski mask, as a matter of freedom of expression, just as vigorously as I will defend a woman's right to wear a niqab.

Incidentally, I thought it was the right that wants small government. Bill 62 is a perfect example of big government run amok; the right should oppose it reflexively."
"I've been a Michele Obama fan since meeting her in Pella,  Iowa a month after Barack made his announcement to run.   She was also the commencement speaker at my daughters graduation from the U of Northern Iowa.    She a very bright woman who relates really well to her audience, including the very white populace of Iowa.   She's just a very easy person to like, as I think her chosen spouse will be as a citizen.   

Nice counts, probably why Iowa embraced them both.

It's really too bad that Oregon is bared by the political parties from having a primary at time that would force all candidates to make a showing here.  The personal contact I got in Iowa, and my wife found in both New Hampshire and Iowa was mostly fun and interesting.   Politically it boost Iowa federal supports and soaks up millions in campaign spending that goes to Iowa pockets.  Down side, political ads in every medium.

Oregon should fight for an improved position in the primary, at least get in line."
Good job Lizzy Acker in trying to drive this woman owned local independent business out. I am sure you will be smugly satisfied when it is replaced with another Starbucks.
"""Also, I personally have never heard women complain about not enough of them being carpenters...""
I spent 23 years working out of the Plumber/Pipefitters union and still hold a book today. It the early 80's there was a surge of women wanting to get into the trades. We accepted several for apprenticeships but comparatively few completed the program. Yes, there are women in the trades today but many are as rough around the edges as any construction hand, not the epitome of femininity."
"we should all be outraged and afraid. outraged that people pay so little for murder, and afraid of the people running this state. shame on all concerned. you have made this women's life nothing more than disposable. sell drugs? get more time. i demand that murderers serve life with NO PAROLE! darn you people anyway. Now: Write via the LIO, a POM to all the REPS. and do it NOW! darn these people, anyway. LIFE IN PRISON WITH NO PAROLE FOR MURDERERS. PERIOD."
"A woman always has control of her body.   If she does not want to get pregnant, do not do the act.  It is that simple.   As far as the nourishing the woman during pregnancy, the same comment applies.  There are ways to handle it that without government intervention.  The problem with abortion is that it is just euphemism for murder of a person that in most cases inconvenient in some fashion.   As the theme song from ""Baretta"" went, ""If you can't do the time, don't do the crime""."

"All joking aside, it is ludicrous in this day and age to demand one gender to walk in a foot casing that is uncomfortable, and causes both short term and  long term damage to the foot.  And for what logical reason?

It is not a nice sight, and for what?

I wonder if the FSB has video of Trump being 'entertained' on his 2013 trip to Moscow with the Miss Universe Pageant? Trump doesn't strike me as one who is overly cautious about his actions around young women.
"What I'm confused about is why you think it is relevant that she had taken drugs over a relatively brief period in the past.  And if you don't think it's relevant, why did you accuse the other poster of ""glossing over"" the fact?

There are lots of victims of violent crime who find it very difficult to testify even though they have the benefit of stable housing and good nutrition.  This woman's normal habit was to be up all night and find safe places to sleep during the day.  It's not surprising she was nodding off during entry of exhibits or that she was traumatized while on the stand.  What's surprising is the court's unusual response of jailing her.

The awful way she was treated gave the defence a whole new argument as to why her testimony should be considered unreliable, ie, more than they would have had if she had been allowed to stay at her mother's house under police supervision, as she quite reasonably requested.  She didn't need to be jailed."
"I didn't say that one's religious principles can transcend the law. However, the RFRA, which is the law of the land, passed by a bipartisan legislature and signed by a Democratic president, does state that ""Government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability."" As a liberal, I think that makes sense, and I'm not really sure it's worth it to force conservative bakers to sell cakes for gay weddings. The principle of religious freedom means a lot to me, as it's one of the hallmarks of the enlightenment and liberal values, and it really pains me to see so many people who call themselves ""progressive"" appear so willing to hem that in. I can see it for some issues, like housing discrimination, but cakes? As for your other point, obviously a government official must do her job. If she can't, she should resign. The courts ruled as much."
It will be interesting to see what comes out... can anyone tell me what might be misrepresentation to a Federal Official or by a Federal Official? Remember the so called Shawinigan Handshake and the so called gag by Jean and Justin? Remember Justin grabbing the MP in the House physically? Remember Justin elbowing the female MP in the House and using some more than strong language? My and this PM  calls himself a  feminist?  When is an assault and assault if the person is a federal official?
"Women (or anyone else for that matter) might get what they want in a car, but will they like the price? Things like sensors to foot-operate rear tailgates, parking assist, backup cameras, side view cameras and so forth tend to drive up the cost. Also, these items are expensive to repair, so insurance costs can increase for cars so equipped. Not saying  it shouldn't happen, only that it will be a more expensive vehicle on a few fronts."
That would be absolutely Yes!!  I've met many of our married Catholic priests who were tossed... A huge disservice to our church..  I've met women who would bless our church as priests..  Our church would show God it really is a church of faith!!!

"Ms. Winkler:  Thank you for your letter.  It reminds 0f the same when I was raised in Northern California.  Sadly, this country has deteriorated into a screaming match between people, activist groups and political parties.  The advent of Facebook and instant news has also contributed to this fiasco of news. 
I was raised where you were taught to say thank you, open the doors for females, to be respectful of all and to say please or your welcome.  One of the things that I very much remember was not to discuss politics in public or even at the family dinner table.
Keep your head high and rise above the muck that some people like to wallow in.

"Bereft of any coherent argument, all poor Bruce can scream is that conservatives are ""racist"" and ""haters.""  It is not racist to enforce federal immigration law.  The bathroom wars are about keeping women safe. Bruce ignores the fact that it was Democrats who were KKK members and enforced Jim Crow laws.  Why are people like Bruce so utterly ignorant of the US Constitution? Just exactly how did America become so wealthy, so open, so free? So Bruce:  move to the Middle East, where they throw gays of tall buildings and slice out the genitals of young girls. Move to China, where there is no freedom of speech and the authorities can seize your property. Move to Cuba, where you will be hustled into a police car for protesting the government. Move to Venezuela, where you will have nothing to eat, thanks to socialist policies."

"Continuation:
There are policies in place that affect women disparately.  For example the majority of those in poverty are women and children.  Family leave policies in the US are generally awful, and child care support is severely lacking.

"It really is worth reading the entire report very slowly and very carefully. Even though even one such event is undesirable, this really does blow the ""1 in 5 college women are raped on campus"" trope out of the water. Considering that Alaska already has a bad reputation for sexual assault, even if we assume the worst case, that all events in both the ""sexual assault only"" and ""both"" category were assaults only upon women, sexual assaults upon women could not exceed about 5% or happen to 1 of 20 college women. If we consider that this is without regard to whether the assault happened on- or off-campus, and many UA students do live and socialize off campus, the ""1 in 20"" figure could drop precipitously."

"Okay, where the province of Quebec parts with the rest of Canada is that most Quebecois can trace their ancestry in that province back many, many generations. A large percentage to New France. This is not like southern Ontario where Liberal whitey capitulated in the late 1960s and early 1970s to the Pierre Trudeau by-in of multiculturalism. 

If the muslims want burial ground southern Ontario is ripe for the picking. Why Wynn may even let you put one on the Bridal Path is she thinks it can save her politically. Give it a try!"
"European countries have implemented similar bans on face coverings, perhaps the strategy of doing nothing in the face of assertive political Islam has failed conclusively in terms of a festering social fabric and segregated communities.

Canada isn't ""different"" from countries where the niqab is common, Canada is advanced. Canada does not punish women for the ""immodesty"" of uncovered hair or kill homosexuals, not because of cultural ""differences"", because of progress. The niqab is not independent of culture in countries where it is most common, it is a symbol of a fundamentalist belief system that also includes the death penalty for homosexuality, ""blasphemy"", and ""apostasy"". After witnessing Europe's regression over the last 15 years, Quebec's new law is progressive and warranted."
"Regarding: ""The number of women serving as presidents of U.S. Catholic colleges has skyrocketed in the past 16 years — up 137 percent from 2000 to 2016, according to the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.""
- That this is a marvel depends on the base line, in this case - years 2000 - 2016.
- If extending the baseline to 1920 then the number of women presidents is seen to be a large number as the women's catholic colleges were lead, you guessed it, by women. 
- It seems the uniqueness of women serving as presidents in these days is that they are usually lay women, that is not consecrated women religious, and that they serve in universities that are now co-educational."

If figure there's no one around to touch it so why spend time putting on lotion! It's quicker to glue! Now I have to say that I have had some very close calls using glue. I have to remember to be careful not to get it other places. I have glued my fingers together but managed to separate them. Any suggestion about that unsticking things?
   I used some similar product I got in the pharmacy that was not as difficult to deal with to put on my rabbits if I accidently cut their skin. Sometimes I had to shave their bums. The skin would spring open really wide so I'd have to pull it together & glue it closed. I must say that the kind of rabbits I had were bred to be very nasty tasting so don't say I should have just eaten them."

The so called war on drugs which was really one of Prohibition which was tried with alcohol  was an unmitigated disaster and failure
and led to the rise of the organized crime groups like the Italian Mob (Mafia, Costa Nostra, Jewish and Irish gangs). 
The War on Drugs have caused the same unanticipated problems if not worse with the rise of the Mexican drug cartels and other
organized criminal groups providing marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamines and other synthetic drugs  which has even
led to the corruption of the government agencies like the CIA and local police jurisdictions, politicians and others who can be bought or
intimidated to look the other way.
Time for the disaster of the War on Drugs to be ended.   Humans for whatever reason  for time immemorial have sought mind altering
substances, so time to race reality."

At least 844 people were injured across the region as police launched baton charges and fired rubber bullets. Police attacked and beat voters at schools and other polling places across the regional capital, Barcelona. Videos emerged of officers kicking, beating with their rubber batons people sitting in polling places and dragging women away by their hair. At the Escola Infant Jesús School polling place, police assaulted Maria José Molina, 64, whose picture with her head drenched in blood went viral on the Internet.

Of course, she is our first lady & no matter what she wears she is still beautiful. I do believe they are some disgruntled clothes perfectionist that do not like this. It is her body & her decision to wear what she wants. I wonder how many of yall have kids that wear their pants to the knees. If yall want to wear tight forming dress & thinks that it is always comfortable go ahead, your choice... I don't think she needs to be a show for the  liberal minded & yes some on the right to look good. No matter what she wears the left will always  criticize what she wears.

"You, or anyone else, can be repulsed by Trump's boastful lying about grabbing womens' genitalia in greeting *and* be repulsed by the policy actions you cite.  There is no sense arguing deductions from a faulty premise, in this case that the two are mutually exclusive.

But the protest is about woman's rights which have been covered under obamas watch the last 8 years? I look at it as a obama protest. I did not realize it was a anti Trump protest instead....and why...that was yesterday? Makes no sense and still not sure why they are protesting. There are women at the womans right protest holding up climate change signs. Does climate change affect womens rights?  The powerful message is they are all messed up and do not know what they are really protesting. It embarassing for the American Woman.They are really looking like fools about now but hey have at er and by the way I hope you are having fun there!
"Well, I disagree.  Lithia Motors enjoys obvious economies of scale that local dealers have a hard time competing with - Lithia is in effect a wholesaler selling to the public.  Lithia can easily adjust operations to accommodate an additional 2.5% cost, and still enjoy those economies of scale profitably.  Once again, those interstate operators will spread the cost thinly among neighboring states.

I don't think Lithia will ""pull up stakes"" in Oregon, why would they?  They are acting like spoiled brats, hoping to influence voters with a phony sob story, like the old soap ""Queen for a day"" - the contestant telling the saddest sob story of her hard life wins the washer-drier combo.

"This is a good idea in principle, but I am not sure it will work in reality and mainly for two reasons: what people can make doesn't often match the quality or design what people want, and there is often no trust and skill to build a viable business. A few practical examples:
- I was in the Eastern Cape where there are plenty of women who make and sell craft. I was excited at the thought to purchase directly from the artisans and contribute to their economy. However, I found that every single person made the same exact thing, in the same way, with the same shapes and colours. So basically, if you don't like the merchandise of one seller, you automatically don't like any of the others.
- I worked with a few dozen smallholder sugarcane farmers in KZN. Besides cane (which is the cash crop) they grow food as well (garlic, potatoes, maize, etc). They sell their food to Durban traders, who come in with the bakkie and buy up everything....continues in next comment"

"Trump's ascension was a direct result of Tea Party, evangelical, and white backlash against disorderly Blacks, Mexican immigrants, a decline in sexual mores and rise of gay marriage. It has been harbored and nurtured as anti Obama and anti woman (especially Hillary Clinton) hate. But most important, it has fostered a hate for the poor, the disabled, the homeless, the sick, the aged, and anyone else in need. These needy folk have been disowned as ""unworthy"" of our concern and suffering from self-inflicted troubles. There is then no mercy - it is their fate until they pray themselves up from their own boot-straps."

Crazy Uncle Bernie and Crazy Uncle Joe combined , could not have raised the kind of money Sec. Clinton raised."
"Gentle
Universal day care probably means more people in the work force, thus more competition for jobs and lower salaries. This explains stagnation of salaries. Women in the work force went from 21% in 1950 to 82% in 2015. In fact that suggests that  salaries should have decreased. 

So businesses like the G&M lobbying/advertising for women to join the work force  has resulted in this generation of workers not having jobs. maybe reduced salaries.  The way out? Two income families consider becoming one income families.  That would give an  unemployed a job, reduce welfare and thus taxes. And you get more time with the kids. More relaxed living.

We are often not given a choice if a child is taken and sent to Anchorage because there is ""specialized"" foster care or residential treatment. Same for mental health issues. People walk away because they don't want to be there. 
You want the money that comes from building and running things but you don't want what goes with it.

Many of those women, later, could not put up with my feminism, because it was too threatening.  I imagine that your mom simply could not face the reality of what happened to you and her inability to protect you.  It IS very sad.  I am truly, truly sorry for what happened, and I'm not trying to minimize what happened.   It's just that, as I've gotten older, I understand more than ever before what a job society had done on women -- to their detriment and that of their children, ie of all of us.  If moms had been treated like people, they would have done a much better job protecting their children."

Tolerance is fine and dandy as long as people don't say things that others find offensive.  While I think we all know that ISIS does not represent Islam anymore than Timothy McVeigh represents Christianity, until such time as everyone is willing to say tolerance does not equal silence and that we are against bad and evil no matter who perpetrates it or which religion's name is used in vain, then we have a problem.

Nobody is a bad person here. The child was being friendly - good for her. The teacher probably didn't realize she was there waiting because she had other things to think of and the child never addressed her. This is just one of those things that happens.

"Personnel matters:  Not the pope's jurisdiction.

Similarly, the pope has absolutely no authority in personnel matters for private non-diocesan high schools either.   Many people don't realize this.

But if that high school were to teach that direct abortion can be a moral act, or that women can be priests, or that no annulment is needed....then the pope (and the local ordinary) would have jurisdiction.

People need to sharpen up their understanding of the role of the Church and pope. I am surprised at how many loquacious people have such a poor demonstrated understanding on such matters."

"Ten or twelve years ago when the Knowles Administration was VERY reluctantly trying to implement the Clinton Era Welfare to Work reforms forced on Clinton and the Democrats by Newt Gingrich, we were trying to figure out how to do this in a rigid merit system and under union contracts; no easy task.   Very few of our potential Welfare to Work applicants could even meet the minimum qualifications for entry-level jobs, Range 8 or 10.   At that time, a single woman with two dependent children if she availed herself of all of the economic benefits for which she was eligible had an income roughly equivalent to a Range 14 or so, and she'd have more disposable income.   That's a job for which she would never qualify absent ten years of so of successful experience.   She would be crazy to go to work for us, few did, and fewer stayed long; they were and still are doing better staying home in their bathrobe - knew one, real well."
I attend a church where there is a fairly prominent SDA  individual who supports the GC decision. What I find inconsistent is that there have been several women who have delivered sermons from the pulpit. I consider this a disservice to the young women who might consider it a green light for women pastors.  Consider this a letter of the law vs spirit of the law mismatch. This WO issue is just symptomatic of the large degree of fanaticism and/or secularism in the denomination.

"Zechariah,

I do not see it as an issue of political correctness because I have seen the Holy Spirit working in my own life and others in recent years in ways that I had never seen before, including using women powerfully in leadership roles in the church. I compare this discussion to the issue in the early church over taking the Gospel to the gentiles because it was anathema to Jews, but the power of the Holy Spirit was too obvious for them to argue. So I think the persistence of argument against the ordination of women where it is socially acceptable gives us clear evidence of a greater problem than the issue being argued. That issue is people being more interested in arguing than they are in seeking the Holy Spirit so they can be guided and empowered as God has He promised. Keep arguing is you wish. But as for me, I want to be effective doing the ministry He has given me so more people can be ready to see Jesus return."

""Trump's running mate, Pence, was at a diner in Toledo when the news broke.""  Ya gotta love that line---WHAT NEWS?  Something the Donald said ten years ago on the set of a TV show? 

I have to agree with the Trumpets on this one.  This is a hit-piece masquerading as news, but it's not even that simple:  This is the MEDIA as carnival barker, hustling you for your time, attention, and money, getting you all amped-up for the SHOWDOWN OF THE CENTURY, a political contest that relies on innuendo and gossip rather than substance or real issues.

It also completely puts the knuckle-dragger vote in the bag for Trump.

Good Grief"
"First off, AT, a reasonable dialogue doesn't use ""exterminating."" Second, there are differences between a fetus and a child, just as there are between a fetus and a fertilized egg. Or between those two and a separate egg and a spermatozoon. When you order breakfast, do you ask for unborn chickens, over-easy? So if you wish to be reasonable, frame the question seriously. 
Again, you would force women to suffer 9 months of ""laboring"" they do not wish: are you somehow the guardian of the universe?

"Not all accusations are initiated by women, I've seen it go both ways.  There are many reasons why an individual waits so many years.  If you have never been victimized I can assure you there is shock, pain, shame and total disbelief awaiting you.  It can take you years to actually understand you did not encourage or deserve it.  I once went to dinner with a group of 11 individuals, 10 of us had been sexually assaulted at one time in our lives.  It was a powerful evening, suddenly realizing you were not the only one in the room hiding your shame for the actions of another.  People get away with things that are extremely difficult to prove all the time.  I would hate to see someone be blamed for something they did not do but I refuse to believe that just because someone was silent for years their story is not truthful or relevant."

I have my own deeply held religious beliefs and object to my tax dollars being used to provide healthcare for Christians. My body and everything therein contained is my property.

"European authorities need to start acting - as it stands, #progressive media and like-minded politicians are more concerned with keeping up politically correct appearances than facing uncomfortable realities. There are neighborhoods across western Europe that are known to provide cover for extremists sympathetic to ISIS and Islamist ideologies. So when we look at these communities, why is the transplanted foreign Imam preaching Wahabi/Salafi fundamentalism not being opposed or deported? Why are the mosques that are known to support extremism not shut down? Why do governments and municipal politicians across western Europe ignore the societal division and segregation as if it's normal for women to be yelled at and intimated for not covering their hair? Western values like gender equality are not a function of cultural relativism, they are a function of progress.  Ideologies that push for society to be governed religious codes are regressive, backwards, and wrong, without exception."

"She may not be at all accurate. We know that all humans have a severe problem with overgeneralization and stereotyping in large groups and under stress.
I could not in good conscience vote for her for 3 egregious reasons. 
Her support for insufficiently regulated financial institutions.
Her eager embrace of war and assassination as diplomacy, and
Her implication in her Party's undemocratic suppression of all other candidates.

While I differ with some of Sen. Harris policies, I admired her incisive DA questioning of dissembling Sessions. Several very skilled and principled women are US Senators. 
Humans recognize deception and hubris; although few or none of us are privy to all the biases of others, it may be best to base votes on one's perceptions of integrity.
While I certainly did not vote for Trump, it strongly appears that those who did were searching for integrity and openness. It seems that voters were looking for the best of a deeply flawed pair."
"Fair enough sky, although you must admit that you've posted critical and anti-Muslim posts here often enough in the past that your motivations and biases can easily be inferred. As for your quote from the Koran, so what? Many religions include modest or chaste dress in their beliefs. Personally I'm not in favour of women veiling themselves but  if that is a woman's choice how does it affect you personally?

It's also a bit patronizing of you to think that even though other religious followers, notably Christians, can approach their holy books with a modern viewpoint, adjusting their religious observances accordingly, yet you seem to think that Muslims must all march in lockstep, following the Koran to the letter.

And following on our recent exchange about your demand that all Muslims prove their loyalty, have you asked your non-Muslim neighbour if his reasons for not attacking you are legal or ethical?"
"Very sad, even though she had issues, she sounds like a nice person who got sucked into a bad life by some douche bag"
"Billions of dollars in drug evidence money missing? Sexual harassment of female officers? Murder because a motorist was black? Racial profiling? NO folks none of the above. It's for a mailbox owned by the chief. It's a nothing burger snowflakes. Too much conspiracy nonsense. Just remember, this is the most inept federal bureaucracy in history. Firing at all levels. Leaking on each other. There is an orange cloud over DC. Hey SA is the charge pergury? What??"
"Do you see any contradiction (or more correctly hypocrisy) in claiming smaller government, states rights, etc. and then the federal government, such as it is, dictating what states can do with federal funding?  Sort of along the lines of telling women what they can and cannot do with their bodies while asserting the primacy of getting the government out of people lives; kinda like the arguments about healthcare, and on, and on, and on."
The benefit of regulation and testing is that you get labratory graded product to verify it is real.  The problem with Kuhio Ave is that there is no guarantee that you drugs are real and not fake.  And that your date is a real woman and not fake. Lol

"You are correct.

In August through October 2015, there was an increase in niqab wearers in Montreal, particularly in the downtown Montreal area, where I have never otherwise seen a niqab. (Niqabs are more common in the Cartierville area, in the north end of Montreal).

From their voices and accents, I could hear that they were young, Quebec born women.

My assumption was that this was some type of protest movement, as they disappeared after the election."
"As I have said, the old days of casual sexual assault and harassment are over and the penalties for that type of local behavior will now no longer be tolerated.  Some out heer say it is a ""
harmless"" part of bad local ""culthcha"" and must be allowed.  As a Great Plains Mandan I refused to tolerate it in my places of employment.  All women need to report harassment immediately to their boss.  If no response, go the police and sue.  Even the sleazy Trump was brought to his knees for fear of lawsuits. 

Only one surprise.  SA says that this teacher was a convicted felon from NYC.  He should never have been hired by the school with that sort of background.  They were just asking for trouble.  Perhaps they did not know about it.  Lots of dudes float out here hoping to hide their criminal records elsewhere.  What academic credentials did he even have?  Publications?  Teaching recommendations?  Curious."
"I just watched a female protester being interviewed on live TV.    She was asked "" what three things did Hillary Clinton accomplish in her political life that impressed you most?""  Her answer was that, well, when she was very young she was helped by Hillary's health plan.....that was all she could come up with.   She had no idea there never was a ""Hillary's health plan"".  Just following some command to get out and protest I imagine.   Now if Wiki Leaks could trace the emails, tweets and FB posts that got this going that would sure be interesting."
"they triple deleted them in BC; including the missing and murdered women information. We are in very corrupt times in Canada, particularly in BC."
In 2018 I will be 61 and will start taking out RRSP money in lieu of early CPP to reduce my RRSP whilst minimizing income tax. I hope to have 40% of my RRSP out by the time I am 65 and if I don't I will continue to reduce my RRSP and defer CPP even further. I don't want a headache in managing an RRSP/RRIF that ends up a tax burden for my wife who has her own RRSP if I die before I get it out at lower income tax rates.
Besides Munoz there are Juneau Republicans like its new mayor and capital City Republican Women board members who by their silence support legislature buying the LIO.
Hillary Clinton is a cunt!
Perhaps they could continue to let the physical sciences and math and engineering etc. continue to award chairs based strictly onmerit. Then the social sciences could appoint strictly on quotas so the average at each university meets the desired targets at each university. Like the chairs in gender studies could all go to women.
"So, an additional descriptive was added. A woman claims to have been raped. A Soho woman claims to have been raped. An immigrant woman, a mute woman, a student....."
"Careers such as carpenters, plumbers, brick layers, back hoe operators, roofing, cement forming, and sky scraper erection  pay really well, have well defined medical and dental plans,  with regulated work schedules with generous overtime.  Many are out doors in the fresh air. Yet women don't line up for that work either."
"""It was also interesting to note that most of those who commented online on the letter missed her point.""

I just thought the meaning of that was that affirmation of women's continued ""victimhood"" needed by Judy wasn't needed or acknoweldged by many of the posters.  

Either because they were strong, empowered women or because they didn't believe in their 'victim' status in the first place."
"Rather than try to go any further in promoting gender diversity, I ask these questions:

1. Do women know what they want (for their lives)? They know where they want to spend 4 years of their lives, at least - nursing, vet and human medicince, for example. 

2. Are women capable of pursuing what they want? 70% of women initiate divorces - and no one is forcing them to get divorced.

3. Being realistic, do you know any women who aren't doing exactly what they want, on any given dimension? We all want to retire in Mexico at age 25, but that's not realistic. I cannot think of one single woman. If a woman wants to work, she does that and chooses the major - same with shacking up, splitting up, even having kids. 

Rather than wasting time on which science trumps and bothering the rest of society with bias training, just determine what women want for their lives - and let's f-----in' move on."
"My son said that love is the most dangerous emotion.  He's pretty damn smart for 26.  Love will make an abused woman think that she should stay with, and work out relations with someone who has proven he doesn't give a damn."
"I'm wondering if Officer Ted Carlson could even catch a grounded duck.

Good thing the EPD officers were there. You go girls!"
"If I'm not mistaken, the Episcopal Church changed its name (if not its legal title) at the same time it ratified a new Book of Common Prayer in 1979. That prayer book emphasized the primacy of the Holy Eucharist in a way previous prayer books had not. The Episcopal Church ""evolved,"" to use a popular term - it became more itself - it became more catholic (small ""c"") not only in terms of its liturgical practice but also in its theology. It did this in large part from having observed Vatican II from afar and absorbing the immense liturgical scholarship that emanated from it. Anglicans are smart - they've never had a problem borrowing the best of our tradition from us. It's time we return the favor and ordain some women."
First we'll have to line up some deals and maybe some women for the Orange Groper. You don't think he'd come here just for the weather do you? There's got to be some serious cash and some serious p involved.
Awesome win ladies!
"That's right, freeheels, because I make it my business to keep myself safe and don't venture off into a wilderness area that's loaded with potential dangerous outcomes.  I'm smart enough to stay away from contracts that warn about possible loss of life.  There's no doubt that these two women made a choice that cost them their lives."
"I would think you should be asking why the republican party basically dumped one of its newer members?  If we are screwed, it is because the two parties have gotten away from their  roots.  The republicans no longer stand for republican values while democrats are not as gutsy as they once were.  We were one of the first states to legalize abortion and to approve the Equal rights amendment.  Sadly we fell to 14 when it came to same sex marriage  and we still haven't totally legalized marijuana, a plant given us by God on the third day of creation.  Sad.

Come on Democrats start being gutsy again. Republicans are probably hopeless although their new leader is somewhat impressive.  It will be interesting to see if she is actually able to do anything.  I hope she succeeds as real competition will improve both parties."
"So highly educated women are going to enter the work force, pay $8B in income taxes then get $8B of ""free"" child care .... ?!
Maybe highly educated women can do the math and save themselves the effort of all the associated costs and time spent ""working"" and just stay home to raise the kids instead of the Nanny State. And to suggest a 2% economic growth is downright laughable ! Of course the growth mantra is what permits governments to borrow even more ....."
"I almost said something unspeakably crass, lol.  I'll just act like the young lady I supposedly am and resist all temptation :)"
"I'd have replied ""I'll move out of the way when a lady comes along""."
"Humiliating his victims is something I could indict her for.  Her circumstances were the same as many other women's.  Nothing that could make it ok for her victim shaming of her husband's women.  I think both candidates are wrong for the job, but Hillary is worse."
"You didn't bother to read this did you?  The judicial appointment committees already existed under Harper.  Trudeau simply disbanded them and reappointed new members to re-balance them in favour of women and minorities.  Now if you want to criticize the government for taking more than a year to do this while some severe criminal cases were being thrown out due to delay, you would have a valid complaint and something that this government and this Minister of Justice should be taken to task for."
"The article clings to the notion that bringing a sex assault to police is a difficult thing to do and no woman does it lightly. They're just as guilty of the officers they accuse of stereotyping. Filing a sex assault allegation is all the rage nowadays. Women cry rape because they're ""aaaangry!!"" 

Only two women charged in the entire country with Public Mischief (false complaint). You seriously want us to believe that only two incidents warranted that charge? All three women in the Gomeshi trial lied through their teeth and not one was charged. That is an outrage and a symptom of the bias in FAVOUR of women. Want to reduce the false allegations? Start upholding the law and charging women when allegations are clearly false!"
"Both great athletes, unfortunately a women's soccer career doesn't pay much at all. I bet they earn under $40,000 annually and Europe sure isn't inexpensive.  Hope they got their degrees at West Virginia and can get on with their lives and find good paying jobs in the ""real world""."
"Why must the poor pay for vaccinations?  John it is a community medical issue and some women can not pay for BC pills on their own just as some people can not pay for vaccinations...  The employer, himself, is not paying for anything, he is paying for negotiated needed medical care..."
Allred has tRump on video/audio admitting to how the attacks unsuspecting beautiful women.  Period.
"<cont> in England I was bumped up 2 grade levels to be with students my own age, as England graduated students at 16, and with our freshman college aptitude. Unfortunate she could not afford this or I would have graduated in England. I came back to OPS, an absolute embarrassment to education, and since my time was being wasted, I dropped out to teach myself, something my mother had taught me to do when I was in 2nd grade.
 In 2nd grade I was threatened with expulsion if I asked anymore questions in class. From that meeting my mother took me to the public library, and taught me how to use a card catalog system, so that I could answer my own questions using the tools available to me. Which is why when I took the GED test I scored 89% higher than the national high school graduate taking the same tests.
 That you belittle this woman of great character does not surprise me. You are CONFUSED after all."
"Exactly. Employers contribute to social security as well, but the transaction is compensation, not an out of pocket expense  on behalf of the individual. business owner. The employee earns it and uses it as he or she pleases. Jehovah's Witnesses dont believe in blood transfusions: should they be allowed to deny employees coverage for that proven and reliable life-saving treatment? Of course not. This is the ridiculous argument Krista makes here and it's only acceptable to her because of her personal position on IUDs."
She is giving all of her efforts to bring back the reputation of KPMG which the firm had before. She  need to take some crucial decisions for it.
"When will JT man up and admit we have a problem? If he is such a feminist then speak out against this ideology and do something concrete.

This is a call for action, not more hand wringing by our soft PM.

At least his Father had a spine. Poor JT, Must have something to do with never having to work a day in his life."
"Your list is nothing more than non-sequitur noise . . . You can get an advanced degree and have a rewarding professional life (absolutely a marker of women's success--what else could it be?) and 1. not have an abortion, 2. not treat sex as a commodity, 3. not look at porn, 4. not commit adultery, 5. not get divorced (or not marry at all), and 5. not be complicit in your child having an ""unstable childhood"". Most of these issues have other thread causes that are not necessarily related to women's emancipation but people do like to smush them together to turn back the clock."
"There's only one active HPD head left and she is certainly the best qualified to lead. To top it all off, she's a legitimately qualified female."
We should not be putting all the blame on this nice lady . She takes advice from her well trained and well experienced Liberal team . Blame them .
"The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence need yo knock this ""convention"" right out of the park. EVERYONE needs to contact the San Francisco ""Mother House"" of this order begging them to make an appearance."
"and I take my food seriously. I don't hate people, that isn't my nature. you think anyone condones human trafficking? you're chatting with a woman here, sensitive by human default."
Over and over and over again!  Reminds me of a story told by a woman I worked with many years ago.  She told how she had always been told that as long as she was nursing she couldn't get pregnant.  One of the other nurses we worked with asked how well it worked.  She laughed and said it took her seven babies in seven years before she decided it didn't work and she found something that did.
When they called your mother answered
Thanks Alexandra... I just made a contribution to ACLU and will be taking money i'd donate to poor now to donate to Planned Parenthood as I value all women's healthcare too (even for abortions).
"Trump did not win, Horrible Hillary lost.
A number of misogynists may have helped Trump, but a much greater horde of progressive people stayed home and did not vote."
I agree with you Don227. If there was an article disparaging women as idiots there would be a protest and a parade.
"KK - we have the biggest sexual assault & domestic violence rates in all 50 states - this does not hobble parenting not does it make girls more likely to be sexually abused. Rapists, pedophiles and child abusers DO NOT take their victims to get abortions!! They leave their victims beaten up, bleeding, ashamed, sick, threatened, scared, embarrassed, alone and traumatized. Now you want to add to that trauma by forcing them to have to tell their parents??!! Good God, you are uniformed and completely clueless about abuse and victims. NONE of my abusers EVER took me to Planned Parenthood, ER room, Doctor or a Hospital. I was left alone, ashamed, traumatized and as every female victim left to pick up the pieces and make the best dcicions for surviving trauma for me. You want to know what your kids are up too? Try open communication, teach about sex and teach your SONS not to be rape, beat or harm girls."
Has this woman been identified?
"And that sort of respect for authority has allowed the Military to be the first social foundation to move forward with racial equality.   It again has stepped up to face homophobic fears and the integration of women into the fighting forces.     Authority is a bit like a weapon, it has power, but it also must be directed by the hand of wise leadership.     I'm not an authority centered person, but as I've grown older, I saw the value of authority in a wide assortment of performance driven occupations.    I might be a child of the early 70's in Eugene with a strong anti-authority attitude, but I could never shut off my rational observations either.   Authority works if done with wisdom.   

Big lesson, everyone wins when authority allows dissension.    The military is a great example of strong discussion of opinions, but done mostly in private where dissension must be honest and supported, then seen as a measure of integrity not betrayal.  There is no shame in losing a fair fight."
So the Holy Spirit is a misogynist just like you. It is said that people believe in God who adheres to their ideas. I think that is true in your case.
"GOP leaders did not ""bolt from Senate candidate Moore."" They shamefully cast doubt on the veracity of the accusers — 4 unconnected women who, with nothing to gain, spoke up against an abuser in a thoroughly researched and reported story that relied on more than 30 sources. But then this is the party whose leader has been accused by far more women than Moore has and who has bragged about committing sexual abuse. The ""if it is true"" response is repulsive, it is craven, it is morally offensive, it is political expediency, and it recalls that famous Republican coinage ""legitimate rape."" Trump, lacking any sense of irony should have remained silent, realizing how inappropriate of him it is to defend another sex offender, but instead he joined the chorus of the supposedly Christian conservatives and spouted the ""if it is true"" defense of someone who for this and many other reasons should not be allowed anywhere near the Senate."
"Comparing fundamentalist Muslim terrorists who are anti-gay, anti-feminist, and anti-abortion with the American Left could be considered hate speech."
"Ah! but don't you nasty, evil women think you are worthy, and sacred enough for priesthood!!!?!

Those who admit to being homosexual are not to be allowed ordination, because transparency is wrong!  Homosexuals should just lie and then they become acceptable for priesthood!?!
 
Divorced can never receive Eucharist but these sex addict priests, and bishops, only need to say I am sorry in secret, in confession, and they can go on to communion the Sunday, after their orgy on Friday, and confession on Saturday.   Sure - Jesus would be fine with that!?!!  Bull!!!

This is very comforting:  
""Alberto Melloni, professor of church history at the University of Modena and Reggio Emilia, said there is nothing unusual about scandals in the priesthood.

"So......I'm guessing ""Woman, Go Make Me A Sandwich Stout"" wouldn't fly here?

"No race or religion elevates Itself by denigrating another. The bile spewed by this woman is no more justifiable than the hateful jargon of the white supremacist.

Not nearly enough attention to this woman's poor children. Imagine what they have been through. That's the real story here.
