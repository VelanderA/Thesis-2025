"You're a real guy.""

What does this all mean for him?

""I feel great right now,"" he said. ""I've been playing hardball for a year and a half."""
"You're a real believer in all things science, not just religion.""

""But you still have to learn all that stuff, right?"" You ask. ""You think science will ever have a magic wand to solve the world's problems?""
"
"You're a real American!"""
You're a real fan of the new Ghostbusters and can't wait to see what the next movie in the franchise has in store for your family!
"You're a real rock star and I look forward to playing you,"" he said. ""You're really exciting. When we first started the band, I thought we had a great record, and as we got older we started getting better at it."
"You're a real guy and you should do a better job than this!""

The man was later found dead a short distance away by a group of other men at the same place where the woman allegedly allegedly shot herself. Police arrested the suspects and"
"You're a real good player when you're healthy, because they're able to take care of everybody.""

This is all going to be good for the Sixers. Even though they missed an opportunity by putting the ball in the paint in the first"
"You're a real deal. Go and fuck yourself.""

After a short break at a hotel near a hotel in Shanghai, Li Yixing and his wife, Peng Xiaodong, were waiting in the lobby of the hotel.

"
"You're a realist.""

""That's right,"" said Hermione. ""It can be a problem at times.""

Hermione nodded. ""Do you like the way I dress?""

""Of course not,"" said Ron."
"You're a real fucking dick,"" M. asks with a grin.

""Yeah, actually,"" says M. as he takes his pants off. ""We used to call it 'The Best M' Thing You Ever Made.'""

"""
"You're a realist, so let's all just agree that every single moment has a value. If you take the time to look at the graph of all life's variables, in a specific order, then we can get an idea of exactly how"
"You're a real jerk with a black eye,"" he said.

""Not really, you have no idea. You probably know you have to watch your fucking legs out.""

He continued. ""I know what this can be, but"
"You're a real jerk…

This is a great one, because I've tried to put my own spin on this. If you want to see me make a video for a free event, don't go there. Don't get me wrong"
"You're a real gamer. Maybe you like action RPGs, or the more casual shooter genre, maybe you just like fantasy, or the more ""romance"" genre, you will like fantasy too, and maybe you like action RPGs or the more casual"
"You're a realist! I know why you're calling me a racist!"" The victim's mom, a black woman who was the target of the attack and ""didn't know what happened to me,"" called police. ""She just ran out of"
"You're a real, hard working mom and a good wife and you're a good guy.""

Kendall then told the group, ""Let's go over and talk about this."""
"You're a real man."" ""Yes."" ""And I'm so sorry for what I've done."" ""I'm sorry for your father. I love you."" - ""You know what that was like."" - ""You were a good little boy"
"You're a real person! And you know, if you can handle a million people, it will get to be your calling card.""

Trump responded: ""You can handle a million people, what you can handle is getting as many people as"
"You're a realist.""

Afterwards he was joined by an elderly lady, with whom he had an argument on the road. ""I don't want her and I don't like her either."" Afterward he went back to his room"
"You're a real fan of his, too. And now you're gonna have to prove that to him."""
"You're a real man and a real mother. How could you possibly ask anyone else not to want you?""

I look at her again and see her hand gripping the bar beside me. I'm sure she'll understand and she'll tell me"
"You're a realist."" ""Oh yeah. If a ghost were to say to a girl that is like, 'Why does the moon rise today?' she probably would,"" said Blachner. The professor explained: ""It's easy to get"
"You're a real loser, right?""

""Nonsense. No, it's you who have no pride in having that pride."""
"You're a real jerk, I've been talking to you to get outta here, don't blame me. No problem. I'll stay.

And so I'm going to the kitchen, it's not like I'll be here."
"You're a real jerk"" and ""You're a jerk and you're going to give them all your stuff you bought because the guy is a jerk.

A: They're not going to give you everything, you have nothing, you can"
"You're a real good friend!"" and ""This might be just the best deal ever."""
You're a real person. Your life is a living hell and I know how hard it is to be loved by some people...but when I came here I felt like this is what I'm getting at here with my life and I'm going to
"You're a real nice person, but a real nice person doesn't have to look like you.""

And they're talking about people like Donald Trump. But who did he think he was? And who did Trump think he was?

"
"You're a real loser here,"" he told her."
"You're a real boy, you're gonna see me right now.""

""What the hell?"" yelled the blond haired, tall black haired, lanky Caucasian with glasses.

""You're an idiot, what are you thinking"
You're a real rock star. You're a real star. I'd like to know why I did it. Where have I got it from? Why can't I go back and find it myself or what? Can't I go to an audition
"You're a real good guy, but you're also probably going to be in trouble.""

When you are in the midst of an existential crisis, it takes only a few seconds to make up your mind: ""Don't feel bad, feel"
"You're a real estate tycoon and I've made a fortune selling houses for tens of millions of dollars. Do you know how much I made in real estate deals?""

The senator asked Trump. ""Do you know how much I made from"
"You're a real hardliner. The last three presidents in recent memory—Barack Obama, Barack Obama—had been so hard on working Americans. And we need to make sure they don't vote because that would be an unconstitutional attack on them."
"You're a realist and you're thinking you're going to be able to hold my hand.""

""I don't believe that I ever would. You never tell people what you think they can do, and they will never ask for that"
"You're a real person, right? I told you so. It hurts to hear you say that, but let me tell you this: You look at me like you've seen some good black people before me. I ain't only black, I"
"You're a real man!

In the middle of all these questions, I can imagine a smile on one of my eyes.

I think to myself that I would be happy to sit next to you.

Now, as soon"
"You're a real gentleman in here, not like I'm a real gentleman and a real gentleman,"" he says quietly. ""You're a real gentleman in here, not like I'm a real gentleman and a real gentleman."" Then he pauses. """
"You're a real loser, you get hit, you get robbed, you get killed, you kill somebody. You're just not prepared and you can't move around."" But even if the guy's scared of you, he still wants to get away"
"You're a real guy, and this can't just be a random one, like someone stole your car at college or something like that, I've seen someone do it all the time.

""But it doesn't stop, it stops,"
"You're a real world company, and you have to understand the things that they're working on. It's not always easy. It can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't work, and sometimes it's difficult to know what's important"
"You're a real good sport fan, and the first game of the season was a chance encounter with someone from a new company. I thought it was the best game I've seen. I don't think my father will ever win an award.""
"
"You're a real American"""
"You're a real man in the kitchen and you're running an empire and you need to be smart about politics. But there's something else going on too."""
"You're a real fan! Why don't you do me some favors and tell him you like his show?""

""Well... you know, I know it's funny, but I think you should be a little more lenient. I don"
"You're a real professional."" ""Yeah. Yeah."" And she looked up, at my gaze, and said, ""You can tell me your name."" ""Nah, let me know.""

""Okay.""

I'm still feeling"
"You're a real man now.""

""I'm happy we came. I know it's your dream and I love you, but I know now is the wrong time.""

""I'm so sorry that I have to leave this world"
"You're a real nice guy. That's something that you can't say.

AMY GOODMAN: He's also going to say, quote, ""I'm not a Christian. I just want someone who cares about children, who cares about them"
"You're a real jerk. It's your fault. And, if a guy gets it right he'll always be a jerk.

""I don't even know where to begin,"" he says. ""But we've been on this for so"
"You're a real man, and I know I look like a real man.""

He didn't mention that ""real"" wasn't the only possible compliment. In reality, that compliment was almost exclusively directed at Trump, who had made an appearance"
"You're a real person, but I've got to tell you that not everyone is a real person."""
"You're a real fan of the original '90s, or you know, maybe '90s, but '60s and '70s music is still more electronic, more hip-hop,"" Sanders told me, adding that the album's lyrics"
"You're a real person.""

So why was he so critical of Kaepernick during the national anthem?

""I just wanted Kaepernick to say that he stood with the people of the great country. That's why, so much about what happened"
"You're a real, solid girl, I've done your homework and all of your kids are perfect.""

"You're a real genius! I made a list!""

It didn't take long, and by the time I got home, I had put on a pair of shoes and a hoodie, put on a pair of underwear and a hoodie"
"You're a real boy you've got to be honest... I'm not scared of girls like you are."" Ruby's head snapped open, she saw her friend starting to take in Weiss, the blond looking girl. ""...What kind of girl do you"
"You're a real human, okay? I'm not going to hold back.

""But we're all adults now. Just like you are. And we're all alive now."""
"You're a real American, right?"" Trump tweeted Monday night after the debate. ""But not for me.""
